       "['Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Falwell. Thank you, faculty, families and friends, and thank you Liberty University Class of 2006 for your welcome and your kind invitation to give this year\\x92s commencement address. I want to join in the chorus of congratulations to the Class of 2006. This is a day to bask in praise. You\\x92ve earned it. You have succeeded in a demanding course of instruction. Life seems full of promise as is always the case when a passage in life is marked by significant accomplishment. Today, it might seem as if the world attends you. But spare a moment for those who have truly attended you so well for so long, and whose pride in your accomplishments is even greater than your own -- your parents. When the world was looking elsewhere your parents\\' attention was one of life\\x92s certainties. So, as I commend you, I offer equal praise to your parents for the sacrifices they made for you, for their confidence in you and their love. More than any other influence in your lives they have helped you -- make you the success you are today and might become tomorrow. Thousands of commencement addresses are given every year, many by people with greater eloquence and more original minds than I possess. And it\\x92s difficult on such occasions to avoid resorting to clichés. So let me just say that I wish you all well. This is a wonderful time to be young. Life will offer you ways to use your education, industry, and intelligence to achieve personal success in your chosen professions. And it will also offer you chances to know a far more sublime happiness by serving something greater than your self-interest. I hope you make the most of all your opportunities. When I was in your situation, many, many years ago, an undistinguished graduate -- barely -- of the Naval Academy, I listened to President Eisenhower deliver the commencement address. I admired President Eisenhower greatly. But I must admit I remember little of his remarks that day, impatient as I was to enjoy the less formal celebration of graduation, and mindful that given my class standing I would not have the privilege of shaking the President\\x92s hand. I do recall, vaguely, that he encouraged his audience of new navy ensigns and Marine lieutenants to become \"crusaders for peace.\" I became an aviator and, eventually, an instrument of war in Vietnam. I believed, as did many of my friends, we were defending the cause of a just peace. Some Americans believed we were agents of American imperialism who were not overly troubled by the many tragedies of war and the difficult moral dilemmas that constantly confront our soldiers. Ours is a noisy, contentious society, and always has been, for we love our liberties much. And among those liberties we love most, particularly so when we are young, is our right to self-expression. That passion for self-expression sometimes overwhelms our civility, and our presumption that those with whom we may have strong disagreements, wrong as they might be, believe that they, too, are answering the demands of their conscience. When I was a young man, I was quite infatuated with self-expression, and rightly so because, if memory conveniently serves, I was so much more eloquent, well-informed, and wiser than anyone else I knew. It seemed I understood the world and the purpose of life so much more profoundly than most people. I believed that to be especially true with many of my elders, people whose only accomplishment, as far as I could tell, was that they\\'d been born before me, and, consequently, had suffered some number of years deprived of my insights. I had opinions on everything, and I was always right. I loved to argue, and I could become understandably belligerent with people who lacked the grace and intelligence to agree with me. With my superior qualities so obvious, it was an intolerable hardship to have to suffer fools gladly. So I rarely did. All their resistance to my brilliantly conceived and cogently argued views proved was that they possessed an inferior intellect and a weaker character than God had blessed me with, and I felt it was my clear duty to so inform them. It\\x92s a pity that there wasn\\x92t a blogosphere then. I would have felt very much at home in that medium. It\\x92s funny, now, how less self-assured I feel late in life than I did when I lived in perpetual springtime. Some of my critics allege that age hasn\\x92t entirely cost me the conceits of my youth. All I can say to them is, they should have known me then, when I was brave and true and better looking than I am at present. But as the great poet, Yeats, wrote, \"All that\\x92s beautiful drifts away, like the waters.\" I\\'ve lost some of the attributes that were the object of a young man\\x92s vanity. But there have been compensations, which I have come to hold dear. We have our disagreements, we Americans. We contend regularly and enthusiastically over many questions: over the size and purposes of our government; over the social responsibilities we accept in accord with the dictates of our consciousness [conscience] and our faithfulness to the God we pray to; over our role in the world and how to defend our security interests and values in places where they are threatened. These are important questions; worth arguing about. We should contend over them with one another. It is more than appropriate: It is necessary that even in times of crisis, especially in times of crisis, we fight among ourselves for the things we believe in. It is not just our right, but our civic and moral obligation. Our country doesn\\x92t depend on the heroism of every citizen. But all of us should be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf. We have to love our freedom, not just for the private opportunities its [sic] provides, but for the goodness it makes possible. We have to love it as much, even if not as heroically, as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk and often the cost of their lives. We must love it enough to argue about it, and to serve it, in whatever way our abilities permit and our conscience requires, whether it calls us to arms or to altruism or to politics. I supported the decision to go to war in Iraq. Many Americans did not. My patriotism and my conscience required me to support it and to engage in the debate over whether and how to fight it. I stand that ground not to chase vainglorious dreams of empire; not for a noxious sense of racial superiority over a subject people; not for cheap oil (we could have purchased oil from the former dictator at a price far less expensive than the blood and treasure we\\x92ve paid to secure those resources for the people of that nation); not for the allure of chauvinism, to wreck [wreak] destruction in the world in order to feel superior to it; not for a foolishly romantic conception of war. I stand that ground because I believed, rightly or wrongly, that my country\\x92s interests and values required it. War is an awful business. The lives of the nation\\x92s finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict. Whether the cause was necessary or not, whether it was just or not, we should all shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. However just or false the cause, how ever proud and noble the service, it is loss -- the loss of friendships, the loss of innocent life, the innocence -- the loss of innocence; and the veteran feels most keenly forever more. Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes war. Americans should argue about this war. They should argue about it. It has cost the lives of nearly 2500 of the best of us. It has taken innocent life. It has imposed an enormous financial burden on our economy. At a minimum, it has complicated our ability to respond to other looming threats. Should we lose this war, our defeat will be further destabilize an already volatile and dangerous region, strengthen the threat of terrorism, and unleash furies that will assail us for a very long time. I believe the benefits of success will justify the costs and the risks we have incurred. But if an American feels the decision was unwise, then they should state their opposition, and argue for another course. It is your right and your obligation. I respect you for it. I would not respect you if you chose to ignore such an important responsibility. But I ask that you consider the possibility that I, too, am trying to meet my responsibilities, to follow my conscience, to do my duty as best as I can, as God has given me light to see that duty. Americans deserve more than tolerance from one another; we deserve each other\\x92s respect, whether we think each other right or wrong in our views, as long as our character and our sincerity merit respect, and as long as we share, for all our differences, for all the noisy debates that enliven our politics, a mutual devotion to the sublime idea that this nation was conceived in -- that freedom is the inalienable right of mankind, and in accord with the laws of nature and nature\\x92s Creator. We have so much more that unites us than divides us. We need only to look to the enemy who now confronts us, and the benighted ideals to which Islamic extremists pledge allegiance -- their disdain for the rights of Man, their contempt for human life -- to appreciate how much unites us. Take, for example, the awful human catastrophe under way in the Darfur region of the Sudan. If the United States and the West can be criticized for our role in this catastrophe it\\'s because we have waited too long to intervene to protect the multitudes who are suffering, dying because of it. Twelve years ago, we turned a blind eye to another genocide, in Rwanda. And when that reign of terror finally, mercifully exhausted itself, with over 800,000 Rwandans slaughtered, Americans, our government, and decent people everywhere in the world were shocked and ashamed of our silence and inaction, for ignoring our values, and the demands of our conscience. In shame and renewed allegiance to our ideals, we swore, not for the first time, \\x93never again.\\x94 But never lasted only until the tragedy of Darfur. Now, belatedly, we have recovered our moral sense of duty, and we are prepared, I hope, to put an end to this genocide. Osama bin Laden and his followers, ready, as always, to sacrifice anything and anyone to their hatred of the West and our ideals, have called on Muslims to rise up against any Westerner who dares intervene to stop the genocide, even though Muslims, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, are its victims. Now that, my friends, is a difference, a cause, worth taking up arms against. It is not a clash of civilizations. I believe, as I hope all Americans would believe, that no matter where people live, no matter their history or religious beliefs or the size of their GDP, all people share the desire to be free; to make by their own choices and industry better lives for themselves and their children. Human rights exist above the state and beyond history -- they are God-given. They cannot be rescinded by one government any more than they can be granted by another. They inhabit the human heart, and from there, though they can be abridged, they can never be wrenched. This is a clash of ideals, a profound and terrible clash of ideals. It is a fight between right and wrong. Relativism has no place in this confrontation. We\\'re not defending -- We\\'re not defending an idea that every human being should eat corn flakes, play baseball, or watch MTV. We\\x92re not insisting that all societies be governed by a bicameral legislature and a term-limited chief executive. We\\'re insisting that all people have a right to be free, and that right is not subject to the whims and interests and authority of another person, government, or culture. Relativism, in this contest, is most certainly not a sign of our humility or ecumenism; it is a mask for arrogance and selfishness. It is, and I mean this sincerely and with all humility, not worthy of us. We are a better people than that. We\\'re not a perfect nation. Our history has had its moments of shame and profound regret. But what we have achieved in our brief history is irrefutable proof that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger, more decent, and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity. As blessed as we are, no nation complacent in its greatness can long sustain it. We, too, must prove, as those who came before us proved, that a people free to act in their own interests, will perceive those interests in an enlightened way, will live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, and make of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages, a civilization in which all people share in the promise and responsibilities of freedom. Should we claim our rights and leave to others the duty to the ideals that protect them, whatever we gain for ourselves will be of little lasting value. It will build no monuments to virtue, claim no honored place in the memory of posterity, offer no worthy summons to the world. Success, wealth and celebrity gained and kept for private interest is a small thing. It makes us comfortable, eases the material hardships our children will bear, purchase[s] a fleeting regard for our lives, yet not the self-respect that, in the end, matters most. But sacrifice for a cause greater than yourself, and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause, your self-respect assured. All lives are a struggle against selfishness. All my life I\\x92ve stood a little apart from institutions that I willingly joined. It just felt natural to me. But if my life had shared no common purpose, it would not have amounted to much more than eccentricity. There is no honor or happiness in just being strong enough to be left alone. I\\'ve spent nearly fifty years in the service of this country and its ideals. I have made many mistakes, and I have many regrets. But I\\'ve never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I wasn\\x92t grateful for the privilege. That\\x92s the benefit of service to a country that is an idea and a cause, a righteous idea and cause. America and her ideals helped spare me from the weaknesses in my own character. And I cannot forget it. When I was a young man, I thought glory was the highest attainment, and all glory was self-glory. My parents had tried to teach me otherwise, as did my church, as did the Naval Academy. But I didn\\x92t understand the lesson until later in life, when I confronted challenges I never expected to face. In that confrontation, I discovered that I was dependent on others to a greater extent than I had ever realized, but neither they nor the cause we served made any claims on my identity. On the contrary, they gave me a larger sense of myself than I had had before. And I am a better man for it. I discovered that nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a cause that encompasses you but is not defined by your existence alone. And that has made all the difference, my friends, all the differences in the world. Let -- Let us argue with each other then. By all means, let us argue. Our differences are not petty. They often involve cherished beliefs, and represent our best judgment about what is right for our country and humanity. Let us defend those beliefs. Let\\x92s do so sincerely and strenuously. It is our right and duty to do so. And let\\x92s not be too dismayed with the tenor and passion of our arguments, even when they wound us. We have fought among ourselves before in our history, over big things and small, with worse vitriol and bitterness than we experience today. Let us exercise our responsibilities as free people. But let us remember, we are not enemies. We are compatriots defending ourselves from a real enemy. We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom, promote the general welfare, and defend our ideals. It should remain an argument among friends; each of us struggling to hear our conscience, and heed its demands; each of us, despite our differences, united in our great cause, and respectful of the goodness in each other. I have not always heeded that injunction myself, and I regret it very much. I had a friend once, who, a long time ago, in the passions and resentments of a tumultuous era in our history, I might have considered my enemy. He had come once to the capitol of the country that held me prisoner, that deprived me and my dearest friends of our most basic rights, and that murdered some of us. He came to that place to denounce our country\\x92s involvement in the war that had led us there. His speech was broadcast into our cells. I thought it a grievous wrong then, and I still do. A few years later, he had moved temporarily to a kibbutz in Israel. He was there during the Yom Kippur War, when he witnessed the support America provided our beleaguered ally. He saw the huge cargo planes bearing the insignia of the United States Air Force rushing emergency supplies into that country. And he had an epiphany. He had believed America had made a tragic mistake by going to Vietnam, and he still did. He had seen what he believed were his country\\x92s faults, and he still saw them. But he realized he has -- he had let his criticism temporarily blind him to his country\\x92s generosity and the goodness that most Americans possess, and he regretted his failing deeply. When he returned to his country he became prominent in Democratic Party politics, and helped [elect] Bill Clinton President of the United States. He criticized his government when he thought it wrong, but he never again lost sight of all that unites us. We met some years later. He approached me and asked to apologize for the mistake he believed he had made as a young man. Many years had passed since then, and I bore little animosity for anyone because of what they had done or not done during the Vietnam War. It was an easy thing to accept such a decent act, and we moved beyond our old grievance. We worked together in an organization dedicated to promoting human rights in the country where he and I had once come for different reasons. I came to admire him for his generosity, his passion for his ideals, and for the largeness of his heart, and I realized he had not been my enemy, but my countryman, my countryman, and later my friend. His friendship honored me. We disagreed over much. Our politics were often opposed, and we argued those disagreements. But we worked together for our shared ideals. We were not always in the right, but we weren\\x92t always in the wrong either, and we defended our beliefs as we had each been given the wisdom to defend them. David [Ifshin]remained my countryman and my friend, until the day of his death, at the age of forty-seven, when he left a loving wife and three beautiful children, and legions of friends behind him. His country was a better place for his service to Her, and I had become a better man for my friendship with him. God bless him. And may God bless you, Class of 2006. The world does indeed await you, and humanity is impatient for your service. Take good care of that responsibility. Everything depends upon it.And thank you, very much, for the privilege of sharing this great occasion with you.',\n",
       " 'Thank -- \\r\\n\\t\\tThank you, fellow Americans.\\xa0I am deeply grateful, very deeply grateful \\r\\n\\t\\tto all of you who have made this night possible.\\xa0We are at war \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight -- a war which started decades ago, a war which we did not start, \\r\\n\\t\\ta war which we cannot stop except by either victory or death.\\xa0Now the \\r\\n\\t\\tKorean war is only one phase of this war between international \\r\\n\\t\\tatheistic communism and our free civilization.\\xa0Now we have been losing \\r\\n\\t\\t-- we\\'ve been losing that war since the shooting part of World War II \\r\\n\\t\\t-- two ended; losing it at an incredibly fantastic rate of \\r\\n\\t\\tspeed,\\xa0losing that war at the rate one hundred million people a year. Now for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe past two and a half years I have been trying to expose and force out \\r\\n\\t\\tof high positions in government those who are in charge of our \\r\\n\\t\\tdeliberate, planned retreat from victory.\\xa0Now this fight --\\xa0this fight \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst international communism should not be a contest between \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica\\'s two great political parties.\\xa0Certainly, after all, the millions \\r\\n\\t\\tof Americans who have long voted the Democrat ticket are just as loyal. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey love America just as much. They hate communism just as much as the \\r\\n\\t\\taverage Republican.\\xa0Unfortunately, the millions of loyal Democrats no \\r\\n\\t\\tlonger have a party in Washington.\\xa0And tonight -- tonight I shall give \\r\\n\\t\\tyou the history of the Democrat candidate for the presidency --\\xa0who \\r\\n\\t\\tendorses and would continue the suicidal,Kremlin-directed \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicies of this nation. Now I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\tnot going to give you speech tonight.\\xa0Tonight I am a lawyer giving you \\r\\n\\t\\tthe facts and the evidence in the case ofStevenson versus \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson.\\xa0Now let me make it clear that I am only covering his \\r\\n\\t\\thistory in so far as it deals with his aid to the communist cause and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe extent -- the extent to which he is part and parcel theAcheson-Hiss-Lattimoregroup.\\xa0Now I perform this unpleasant task because the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople are entitled to have the coldly documented history of this man \\r\\n\\t\\twho says, \\x93I want to be your President.\\x94\\xa0Now the issue which faces a \\r\\n\\t\\thundred and fifty million American people tonight, very simply stated \\r\\n\\t\\tis: Will communism win or will America win?\\xa0And you the people -- you \\r\\n\\t\\tthe people who are listening to me tonight on radio, television, here \\r\\n\\t\\tin the hall, will decide that issue on November 4th because we shall \\r\\n\\t\\twin or lose depending upon the leadership which we choose on that day. I shall \\r\\n\\t\\tnow try to put\\xa0 together -- I shall now try to put together the jigsaw \\r\\n\\t\\tpuzzle of the man who wants to be President on the Truman-Acheson \\r\\n\\t\\tticket.\\xa0And I don\\'t call the Democrat ticket because it would be a great \\r\\n\\t\\tinsult to all the good democrats in this nation.\\xa0That which I present to \\r\\n\\t\\tyou tonight is only that part of his history on which I have complete, \\r\\n\\t\\tunchallengeable documentation. Now Stevenson has not yet heard the \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech but already he and his camp are denouncing it as a pack of lies. Tonight -- \\r\\n\\t\\tTonight I give you the cold record a full week -- a week and a day \\r\\n\\t\\t-- before election so that he may have a chance to explain this record if \\r\\n\\t\\the can.\\xa0Now these facts, my good friends, can -- can not be answered -- \\r\\n\\t\\tcan not be answered by streams of smears and lies.\\xa0These facts can only \\r\\n\\t\\tbe answered by facts.\\xa0And we call upon Adlai of Illinois to so answer \\r\\n\\t\\tthose facts. But time is short so let me get about the task of looking \\r\\n\\t\\tat his record.\\xa0The Democrat candidate has said, and I quote him \\r\\n\\t\\tverbatim, he said \\x93As evidence of my direction I have established my \\r\\n\\t\\theadquarters here in Springfield with people of my own choosing.\\x94\\xa0In \\r\\n\\t\\tother words he says, judge me -- \"...judge me by the advisors \\r\\n\\t\\twhom I\\'ve selected.\"\\xa0Good, let\\'s do that. Let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\texamine -- Let\\'s examine a few of those advisors first.\\xa0First isWilson \\r\\n\\t\\tWyatt, his personal manager.\\xa0Now Wilson Wyatt is the former head of the \\r\\n\\t\\tleft wing ADA, the Americans for Democratic Action. The ADA has five \\r\\n\\t\\tmajors points in its program. Listen to these and remember them if you \\r\\n\\t\\twill. Point number one: Repeal the Smith Act, which makes it a crime to \\r\\n\\t\\tconspire to overthrow this government. Number two: Recognition of Red \\r\\n\\t\\tChina. Number three: Opposition to loyalty oaths. Number four: Condemnation of the FBI for exposing traitors likeCoplonand Gubitchev. And number five: Continuous all out opposition of theHouse Committee on Un-American Activities. Nothing secret about that platform; they publish \\r\\n\\t\\tit day after day. Now \\r\\n\\t\\taccording to an article in New York Times -- may I have that -- which I \\r\\n\\t\\thold in my hand, the Democrat candidate\\'s campaign manager, Wyatt, \\r\\n\\t\\tcondemned the government\\'s loyalty program and here\\'s the proof; it condemned the loyalty program \\r\\n\\t\\tin the most vicious terms.\\xa0Strangely, \\r\\n\\t\\tAlger I mean Adlai -- Adlai in 1952, now that he\\'s running for President \\r\\n\\t\\tsays, \\x93I will dig out the communists using as my weapon the loyalty \\r\\n\\t\\tprogram which my campaign manager damns and condemns.\\x94 Next, and \\r\\n\\t\\tperhaps the key figure in the Stevenson camp, is his speech writer,Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,\\xa0former vice-chairman of the same ADA.\\xa0Now \\r\\n\\t\\tSchlesinger has been a writer, incidentally, for the New York Post -- New \\r\\n\\t\\tYork Post whose editor and his wife admit -- admit that they were \\r\\n\\t\\tmembers the YoungCommunist League. Now in 1946, Stevenson\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech writer wrote that the present system in the United States makes, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I quote -- listen to this, here is his speech writer. He says, \\x93The \\r\\n\\t\\tpresent system in the United states makes even freedom loving Americans \\r\\n\\t\\tlook wistfully at Russia.\\x94\\xa0I wonder if there\\'s anyone in this audience \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight who is looking wistfully at Russia.\\xa0And I wonder also if some \\r\\n\\t\\tcalamity would happen and Stevenson would be elected, what job this man \\r\\n\\t\\twould have. But perhaps \\r\\n\\t\\tthe most revealing article written by Stevenson\\'s speech writer appeared \\r\\n\\t\\tin the New York Times on December 11, 1949, on page three.\\xa0And listen to \\r\\n\\t\\tthis if you will, and I quote, he says, I happen to believe -- \"I happen \\r\\n\\t\\tto believe that the Communist Party should be granted the freedom of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical action and that communists should be allowed to teach in \\r\\n\\t\\tuniversities.\\x94\\xa0 Nothing secret, right -- right, nothing secret about \\r\\n\\t\\tit.\\xa0It\\'s in the New York Times December 11, 1949.\\xa0Stevenson\\'s speech \\r\\n\\t\\twriter saying, \\x93I think that communists should be allowed to teach your \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren,\\x94 my good friends.\\xa0And he says, Oh, but judge me -- \"judge me by \\r\\n\\t\\tthe advisors whom I select.\" Now let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tsee how Stevenson\\'s speech writer feels on the subject of religion. The \\r\\n\\t\\tanswer is given in his review of the book of Whittaker \\r\\n\\t\\tChambers,\\xa0Whittaker Chambers, the man whose testimony convicted Alger \\r\\n\\t\\tHiss.\\xa0Chambers, in his book, as you know, maintain that a belief in God \\r\\n\\t\\twas the hope of the free world, a feeling which most Americans have \\r\\n\\t\\tregardless whether Protestant, Jewish, or Catholic.\\xa0Well, \\r\\n\\t\\tSchlesinger wrote about that.\\xa0What did he say?\\xa0He says this, let me \\r\\n\\t\\tquote him verbatim, he says, the whole record -- \"the whole record of \\r\\n\\t\\thistory indeed gives proof that a belief in God has created human vanity \\r\\n\\t\\tas overweening, and human arrogance as intolerable as the vanity and \\r\\n\\t\\tarrogance of the communists.\\xa0And I say all of these documents are \\r\\n\\t\\tavailable for my good friends of the press to examine, each and \\r\\n\\t\\tevery one -- every one of them. Now, \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson says judge me by the people I choose as my advisors.\\xa0Here \\r\\n\\t\\tyou have the philosophy of his chief advisor; the philosophy of his \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech writer laid bare.\\xa0This idea, of course -- that religion should be \\r\\n\\t\\tridiculed -- is one of the basic principles of the Communist Party.\\xa0Now \\r\\n\\t\\tif you couple -- couple this ridicule of religion with his statement \\r\\n\\t\\tthat communists should be allowed to teach your children, and you have a \\r\\n\\t\\tfairly clear portrait of the man. Another of \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson\\'s assistants, Richard DeVoto.\\xa0Now DeVoto has violently \\r\\n\\t\\tattacked our strongest defense against communism --\\xa0the FBI.\\xa0In Harper\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tMagazine, as reported in theDaily Workerof December 29, 1949, page \\r\\n\\t\\tseven, his man DeVoto denounces the FBI as, quote, \\x93nothing but college \\r\\n\\t\\ttrained flat-feet.\\x94\\xa0Then he says this, \\x93and I would refuse to cooperate \\r\\n\\t\\twith the FBI.\\x94\\xa0 Now the Communist Daily Worker of February 13, 1947, \\r\\n\\t\\treports that Stevenson\\'s man, DeVoto, headed a group seeking a permit \\r\\n\\t\\tfor a meeting for the wife ofGerhart Eisler, the communist who had \\r\\n\\t\\tdisappeared behind the iron curtain and who, as of tonight, is heading \\r\\n\\t\\tup the anti-communist group in east Berlin.\\xa0So much for that. The next \\r\\n\\t\\tone of the men selected by Stevenson as one of his ghost writers is a \\r\\n\\t\\tman, Jim --James Wechsler.\\xa0Now Wechsler and his wife both admit -- both \\r\\n\\t\\tadmit having been members of the Young Communist League.\\xa0And I hold in \\r\\n\\t\\tmy hand an article from the New York Times which states that Wechsler\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tthe man who helped Stevenson write the speech -- here it is -- helped \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson write the speech in which Stevenson ridiculed anti-communists, \\r\\n\\t\\tas \\x93men who hunt for communists in the bureau of wildlife and \\r\\n\\t\\tfisheries.\\x94\\xa0That\\'s the speech also in which he condemned -- condemned my \\r\\n\\t\\texposure of communists as \\x93low comedy.\\x94\\xa0Well I just doubt whether the mothers \\r\\n\\t\\tand wives of the hundred and twenty thousand Korean casualties consider \\r\\n\\t\\tit low comedy. I think they may possibly consider it a high \\r\\n\\t\\ttragedy.\\xa0I\\'d like to call Mr. Stevenson\\'s attention to that. Some light \\r\\n\\t\\t-- Some light is shed upon the importance of this man in the Stevenson \\r\\n\\t\\tcamp;\\xa0but a list of long distance phone calls between the Governor\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\toffice in Springfield and this man who says, \\x93I belong to the Young \\r\\n\\t\\tCommunist League,\\x94 Wechsler.\\xa0Here\\'s a list of the phone calls between \\r\\n\\t\\tWechsler and the Governor\\'s mansion.\\xa0I will not read it over, but it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tavailable to the press.\\xa0One of these calls particularly is important. I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink this might be called a \"trigger call\" -- a \"trigger phone call,\" made \\r\\n\\t\\tjust -- made just before Wechsler and two others unleashed the smear \\r\\n\\t\\tattack upon Richard Nixon. Well, \\r\\n\\t\\tanother of the men on the democrat candidate\\'s camp isArchibald Macleish.\\xa0Stevenson\\'s biography on page 77 states that Macleish was the \\r\\n\\t\\tman who brought him\\xa0into the State Department.\\xa0It\\'s his own \\r\\n\\t\\tbiography.\\xa0Now Stevenson has him as an advisor.\\xa0How about this man Macleish?\\xa0He\\'s got perhaps the longest record of affiliation with \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunist fronts of any man that I have ever named in Washington.\\xa0And \\r\\n\\t\\tAdlai says, \"Judge me by the friends I select.\\'\\xa0To that I say, amen, \\r\\n\\t\\tAdlai, amen. The time -- \\r\\n\\t\\ttime is running out -- time is running out and I would like to give you \\r\\n\\t\\tmore about the people who are guiding Stevenson, but let\\'s go on to \\r\\n\\t\\tother things. In Stevenson\\'s biography \\r\\n\\t\\t-- and here\\'s something which I \\r\\n\\t\\tespecially call to your attention -- in Stevenson\\'s biography, on page 73, \\r\\n\\t\\twe find that in the summer of 1943 -- this is his own biography -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tsummer of 1943, after Mussolini\\'s government had fallen, Stevenson was \\r\\n\\t\\tgiven the task of formulating America\\'s post-war policy in Italy.\\xa0On \\r\\n\\t\\tpage 75 we find the statement that his recommendations were followed in \\r\\n\\t\\tItaly.\\xa0When Truman was before a crowd in -- in New York -- thank you \\r\\n\\t\\t-- New York on Columbus day, and he confirmed the fact that Stevenson\\'s the man \\r\\n\\t\\twho, as he said, sowed the seeds for the immediate \\r\\n\\t\\tpostwar policy in Italy.\\xa0Well,General Bedell Smith, a fine American, in \\r\\n\\t\\this testimony and in his book, has told what that foreign policy \\r\\n\\t\\testablished by Stevenson was.\\xa0And listen to this if you will, he says \\r\\n\\t\\tthat foreign policy, here\\'s his testimony, page 35 and 37, he says that \\r\\n\\t\\tforeign policy was, to connive -- \"to connive to bring communists into \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Italian government and to bring the Italian communist leader,Togliatti, back from Moscow.\\x94 You get \\r\\n\\t\\tthe picture of that my friends?\\xa0Stevenson says, \\x93I was the man who \\r\\n\\t\\tformulated the policy.\\x94\\xa0Truman says, yes he did.\\xa0And the head of the \\r\\n\\t\\tCentral Intelligence Agency says the policy then was \\x93to connive to put \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunists into the Italian government\\x94\\xa0-- connive, and to bring [Toggliatti], \\r\\n\\t\\tthe communist leader, back from Moscow, which they did. Keep in \\r\\n\\t\\tmind that Bedall Smith had nothing to do with this program; he was just \\r\\n\\t\\ttestifying as to what it was. Now I know -- I know that one of the defense \\r\\n\\t\\t-- defenses of this will be raised by the Stevenson camp tomorrow will \\r\\n\\t\\tbe that, well, Eisenhower was in charge of the European military forces \\r\\n\\t\\tof that time.\\xa0But Stevenson knows; his camp followers know; you know \\r\\n\\t\\tand I know that Eisenhower had nothing to do with formulating State \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment policy.\\xa0He had the task -- He had the task of winning the war \\r\\n\\t\\tin Europe with the loss of the smallest amount of bloodshed and lives \\r\\n\\t\\tand he did that job very well. Now let \\r\\n\\t\\t-- let \\r\\n\\t\\tus pick-- let us pick another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of Stevenson\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\thistory.\\xa0On September 23rd of this year,Admiral Staton, who was a holder \\r\\n\\t\\tof theMedal of Honor, signed a statement for us; signed a statement \\r\\n\\t\\tcovering his experience with Stevenson after he, Staton, had been \\r\\n\\t\\tassigned to the task of enforcing public law 151 and order -- and removing the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunists from the radios aboard our ships. Well \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson was a special assistant at that time, in the Navy \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment.\\xa0He called Admiral Staton to his office and here\\'s the \\r\\n\\t\\taffidavit given to us by Staton about that meeting.\\xa0Hasn\\'t been used \\r\\n\\t\\tuntil tonight. Let me read just one paragraph from it.\\xa0He says, \\x93On \\r\\n\\t\\tarrival, Stevenson told me that he had received six or eight of the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunist cases which my board had recommended for removal, and that he \\r\\n\\t\\twanted to discuss them with me.\\x94\\xa0Still quoting the admiral, \\x93Stevenson \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid that he could not see that we had anything against them and stated \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we should not be hard on the communists.\\xa0The conference ended with \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson disagreeing with our recommendations to fire the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunists.\\x94\\xa0This was in 1943, my good friends, and two or three days \\r\\n\\t\\tago Stevenson went on the air and said, but he said, \\x93Oh, in 1943, I was \\r\\n\\t\\twarning about the dangers of communism in the Mediterranean.\\x94 Well -- \\r\\n\\t\\tWell immediately -- immediately after Staton appeared at Stevenson\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\toffice and said, \\x93Mr. Stevenson, get rid of those communists; the law \\r\\n\\t\\tprovides you must.\\x94 But he said no.\\xa0What happened to Staton, he was \\r\\n\\t\\tretired to inactive duty. And now \\r\\n\\t\\tanother part of the jigsaw puzzle of Stevenson\\'s history is his \\r\\n\\t\\tmembership over many years on the central committee of theWorld \\r\\n\\t\\tCitizen\\'s Association.\\xa0Now I know that you may find some good people on \\r\\n\\t\\tthat organization; you may even find some good Republicans.\\xa0But \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson was not merely a member of the group.\\xa0Stevenson was one of the \\r\\n\\t\\ttwelve-man, policy-forming committee. Now this is quite enough, \\r\\n\\t\\treally quite enough.\\xa0But time is so short I\\'ll only cover \\r\\n\\t\\tplank five in their platform.\\xa0I hold their platform in my hands.\\xa0Keep in \\r\\n\\t\\tmind that the twelve men, including Stevenson, drafted this platform.\\xa0Let \\r\\n\\t\\tme read plank number five:\\xa0\\x93National states must be subordinate to world \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilization; their jurisdiction must be limited by world law; and any \\r\\n\\t\\tlocal legislation contrary to world law must be null and void.\\x94\\xa0Now what \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes this mean my good friends?\\xa0What does this mean to the hundred and \\r\\n\\t\\tfifty million American people?\\xa0It means that a world organization, such \\r\\n\\t\\tas the United Nations, could veto -- veto any state or federal law or \\r\\n\\t\\tany part of our Constitution. This \\r\\n\\t\\tbecomes doubly significant in view of the recent revelations that twelve \\r\\n\\t\\t-- twelve of the men who were recommended by the State Department to the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited Nations have been dropped because they refused to say under oath \\r\\n\\t\\twhether or not they were -- had been members of the Communist Party; twelve of the men in this world organization which should have the power \\r\\n\\t\\tto veto your laws.\\xa0Well -- Well Stevenson\\'s own office has been stating \\r\\n\\t\\tthat he was a member of this unusual organization for only -- only -- \\r\\n\\t\\t1941.\\xa0I have here a copy ofWho\\'s Who, which he gives \\r\\n\\t\\tthem a signed \\r\\n\\t\\tstatement admitting he was amember up until 1945.\\xa0I have a copy \\r\\n\\t\\tof the\\xa0 letterhead of this organization, February 1948, carrying \\r\\n\\t\\tStevenson, not as a member but as part of the central committee, twelve \\r\\n\\t\\tman governing body.\\xa0Well, why is this significant?\\xa0Simply my friends, \\r\\n\\t\\tsimply because you\\'re asked to elect a presidential candidate who \\r\\n\\t\\tproposed to fly the flag of a super-world government over the stars and \\r\\n\\t\\tstripes.\\xa0But let\\'s move on to another part of the jigsaw puzzle. Now, while \\r\\n\\t\\tyou would think -- while you may think there can be no connection between the \\r\\n\\t\\tdebonair Democrat candidate and a dilapidated Massachusetts barn, I want \\r\\n\\t\\tto show you a picture of this barn and explain the connection.\\xa0Here\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tthe outside of a barn. Give me the picture showing the inside, if you \\r\\n\\t\\twill. Here is the outside of the barn up at Lee, Massachusetts. It looks \\r\\n\\t\\tit couldn\\'t house a farmer\\'s cow or goat -- the outside. Here\\'s the \\r\\n\\t\\tinside: a beautifully paneled conference room with maps of the Soviet \\r\\n\\t\\tUnion. Well, in what way does Stevenson tie up with this?\\xa0 My -- My \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigators went up and took pictures of this barn after we had been \\r\\n\\t\\ttipped off what was in it -- tipped off that there was in this barn all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe missing documents from the communist front --IPR-- the IPR which \\r\\n\\t\\thas been named by theMcCarran Committee-- named before the McCarran \\r\\n\\t\\tCommittee as a cover shop for communist espionage.\\xa0When we went up and \\r\\n\\t\\twe found in the room adjoining this conference room, 200,000 -- 200,000 of the missing IPR documents.\\xa0The hidden files showing the \\r\\n\\t\\tvouchers,among other things; showing money from Moscow; and the \\r\\n\\t\\tentire interlocking group of communists.\\xa0And, Senator McCarran -- \\r\\n\\t\\tSenator McCarran -- Senator McCaran\\'s committee unanimously -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tcommittee of four democrats and three republicans -- a committee of four \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocrats, three republicans -- unanimously found that the IPR was \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunist controlled, communist dominated, and shaping our foreign \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicy. Now let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\ttake a look at aphotostatof a document taken from that Massachusetts \\r\\n\\t\\tbarn.\\xa0One of those documents was never supposed to have seen the light \\r\\n\\t\\tof day. Rather interesting, it is. This is the document which shows that \\r\\n\\t\\tAlger Hiss and Frank Coe recommended Adlai Stevenson to the Mount Tremblant Conference which was called for the purpose of establishing \\r\\n\\t\\tforeign policy -- postwar foreign policy -- in Asia. Now, as you know, \\r\\n\\t\\tAlger Hiss is a convicted traitor. Frank Coe has been named under oath \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore congressional committees seven times as a member of the Communist \\r\\n\\t\\tParty. Why? Why do Hiss and Coe find that Adlai Stevenson is the man \\r\\n\\t\\tthey want representing them at this conference? I don\\'t know. Perhaps \\r\\n\\t\\tAdlai knows. We now \\r\\n\\t\\tcome to the much discussed testimony by Adlai Stevenson in the trial of \\r\\n\\t\\tAlger Hiss.\\xa0 Now, my good friends, I haven\\'t considered -- I have not \\r\\n\\t\\tconsidered this fact standing alone as overly important in the Stevenson \\r\\n\\t\\trecord.\\xa0 It is only a link in the chain of events which prove the case \\r\\n\\t\\tinStevenson versus Stevenson.\\xa0Now what does impress me, however, is the \\r\\n\\t\\tdeathly fear that Governor Stevenson displays when additional links \\r\\n\\t\\ttying him to Alger Hiss are brought forth.\\xa0We find that he very \\r\\n\\t\\tcleverly attempts to imply that his knowledge of Hiss was casual, \\r\\n\\t\\tremote, and that he was not vouching for Hiss\\'s character at the trail. I hold in \\r\\n\\t\\tmy hand a petition which has never been made public before either in \\r\\n\\t\\t-- in the New York courts,\\xa0a petition by the Hiss lawyers when they asked the \\r\\n\\t\\tcourt to admit Stevenson\\'s statement.\\xa0You recall Stevenson said, \\x93I will \\r\\n\\t\\tsign a statement but I will not go to New York and under \\r\\n\\t\\tcross-examination.\\x94\\xa0Let me read this one small section of this affidavit \\r\\n\\t\\tto you -- and the entire affidavit is available to the press.\\xa0Here\\'s the \\r\\n\\t\\taffidavit of Hiss\\' lawyer: \\x93Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois has \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen closely associated with Alger Hiss in the course of certain \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational diplomatic undertakings. They were together at the San \\r\\n\\t\\tFrancisco conference, at the United Nations at which the charter of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUN was adopted.\\xa0And they were also together at the London conference \\r\\n\\t\\twhich preceded and prepared the agenda for the San Francisco \\r\\n\\t\\tconference.\\x94\\xa0They say this, \\x93The testimony of Governor Stevenson would \\r\\n\\t\\tbe of great importance to Alger Hiss.\\x94 Now I want \\r\\n\\t\\tyou to examine closely the statement Governor Stevenson made at \\r\\n\\t\\tCleveland Ohio, about two days ago, the\\xa0 23rd,\\xa0 which he \\r\\n\\t\\tattempted to defend his support of the reputation of Hiss -- Hiss the \\r\\n\\t\\tarch-traitor of our time.\\xa0Stevenson said this last Thursday, and I quote \\r\\n\\t\\thim. He said, \\x93I said his reputation was good.\\xa0I did not say that his \\r\\n\\t\\treputation wasverygood.\\x94\\xa0Now here -- here we have -- here we have a \\r\\n\\t\\tman that says, \\x93I want to be your President,\\x94 claiming that Hiss\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\treputation was good but not very good.\\xa0Now I say, my good friends, that \\r\\n\\t\\tif he had such misgivings, he should not have vouched for Hiss at \\r\\n\\t\\tall.\\xa0There are -- There are no degrees of loyalty in the United States; \\r\\n\\t\\ta man is either loyal or he\\'s disloyal.\\xa0There --\\xa0There is -- There is \\r\\n\\t\\t-- There is no such thing -- There is no such thing as being a little \\r\\n\\t\\tbit disloyal or being partly a traitor. Now I note \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the television man is holding up a sign saying 30 seconds to go.\\xa0I \\r\\n\\t\\thave much, much more of the documentation here.\\xa0I\\'m sorry we can\\'t give \\r\\n\\t\\tit to our television audience and I want our audience to know it is not \\r\\n\\t\\tthe fault of the television stations.\\xa0We\\'ve only arranged for half an \\r\\n\\t\\thour, and that half an hour is about up.\\xa0But with your permission, my \\r\\n\\t\\tgood friends, when we go off the air I would like to complete for this \\r\\n\\t\\taudience, the documentation....',\n",
       " 'Thank you. Thank you so much. You \\r\\n-- You just \\r\\nhave no idea how warming and how generous that welcome is, your love is, your \\r\\naffection, and I\\'m gratified by it. I\\'m sorry that we got here a little bit late \\r\\nand a little bit short. Earlier today, I spoke to President Bush, and I \\r\\noffered him and Laura our congratulations on their victory. We had a good \\r\\nconversation and we talked about the danger of division in our country and the \\r\\nneed -- the desperate need -- for unity, for finding the common ground, coming \\r\\ntogether. Today, I hope that we can begin the healing. In America -- In America it is vital \\r\\nthat every vote count, and that every vote be counted. But the outcome should be \\r\\ndecided by voters, not a protracted legal process. I would not give up this fight if there was a \\r\\nchance that we would prevail. But it is now clear that even when all the \\r\\nprovisional ballots are counted, which they will be, there won\\'t be enough \\r\\noutstanding votes for us to be able to win Ohio. And therefore, we can not win \\r\\nthis election. My friends, it was here that we began our \\r\\ncampaign for the presidency. And all we had was hope and a vision for a better \\r\\nAmerica. It was a privilege and a gift to spend two years traveling this \\r\\ncountry, coming to know so many of you. I wish that I could just wrap you up in \\r\\nmy arms and embrace each and every one of you individually all across this \\r\\nnation. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Audience member: We still got your back! Thank you, man. And I assure you -- you watch -- \\r\\nI\\'ll still have yours, so hang in there. I will always be particularly grateful to the \\r\\ncolleague that you just heard from who became my partner, my very close friend, \\r\\nan extraordinary leader, John Edwards. And I thank him for everything he did \\r\\nand.... \\r\\nJohn and I would be the first to tell you that we owe so much to our families. \\r\\nThey\\'re here with us today. They were with us every single step of the way. They \\r\\nsustained us. They went out on their own and they multiplied our campaign, all \\r\\nacross this country. No one did this more with grace and with courage and candor that I love than my wife, Teresa. And I thank her. Thank you. And our children were there every single step of the way. It was unbelievable. \\r\\nVanessa, Alex, Chris, Andre and John, from my family, and Elizabeth Edwards who \\r\\nis so remarkable and so strong and so smart. And Johnny and Cate, who went out \\r\\nthere on her own just like my daughters did. And also Emma Claire and Jack who \\r\\nwere up beyond their bedtime last night, like a lot of us. I want to thank my crewmates and my friends from \\r\\n35 years ago -- that great \\x91band of brothers\\x92 who crisscrossed this country on my \\r\\nbehalf through 2004. (Thank you.) They had the courage to speak the truth back \\r\\nthen, and they spoke it again this year, and for that, I will forever be \\r\\ngrateful. And thanks also as I look around here to friends \\r\\nand family of a lifetime. Some from college, friends made all across the years, \\r\\nand then all across the miles of this campaign. You are so special. You brought \\r\\nthe gift of your passion for our country and the possibilities of change, and \\r\\nthat will stay with us and with this country forever. Thanks to Democrats and Republicans and \\r\\nIndependents who stood with us, and everyone who voted no matter who their \\r\\ncandidate was. And thanks to my absolutely unbelievable, \\r\\ndedicated staff, led by a wonderful campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, who did \\r\\nan extraordinary job. There\\'s so much written about campaigns, and there\\'s so \\r\\nmuch that Americans never get to see. I wish they could all spend a day on a \\r\\ncampaign and see how hard these folks work to make America better. It is its own \\r\\nunbelievable contribution to our democracy, and it\\'s a gift to everybody -- but \\r\\nespecially to me. And I\\'m grateful to each and every one of you, and I thank \\r\\nyour families, and I thank you for the sacrifices you\\'ve made. And to all the volunteers, all across this \\r\\ncountry who gave so much of themselves. You know, thanks to William Field, a \\r\\nsix-year-old who collected $680, a quarter and a dollar at a time selling \\r\\nbracelets during the summer to help change America. Thanks to Michael Benson \\r\\nfrom Florida who I spied in a rope line holding a container of money, and turned \\r\\nout he raided his piggy bank and wanted to contribute. And thanks toIlana \\r\\nWexler, eleven years old, who started \"Kids for Kerry\" all across our country. I \\r\\nthink of the brigades of students and people, young and old, who took time to \\r\\ntravel, time off from work, their own vacation time to work in states far and \\r\\nwide. They braved the hot days of summer and the cold days of the fall and the \\r\\nwinter to knock on doors because they were determined to open the doors of \\r\\nopportunity to all Americans. They worked their hearts out, and I wish -- you \\r\\ndon\\'t know how much -- that I could have brought this race home for you, for them. And I say to them now, don\\'t lose faith. What you did made a difference, and building on \\r\\nitself -- building on itself, we go on to make a difference another day. I \\r\\npromise you, that time will come. The time will come, the election will come \\r\\nwhen your work and your ballots will change the world, and it\\'s worth fighting \\r\\nfor. I want to especially say to the American people \\r\\nin this journey, you have given me the honor and the gift of listening and learning \\r\\nfrom you. I have visited your homes. I\\'ve visited your churches. I\\'ve visited \\r\\nyour community halls. I\\'ve heard your stories. I know your struggles. I know your \\r\\nhopes. They\\'re part of me now, and I will never forget you, and I\\'ll never stop \\r\\nfighting for you. You may not understand completely in what ways, \\r\\nbut it is true when I say to you that you have taught me and you\\'ve tested me \\r\\nand you\\'ve lifted me up, and you made me stronger. I did my best to express my \\r\\nvision and my hopes for America. We worked hard, and we fought hard, and I wish \\r\\nthat things had turned out a little differently. But in an American election, there are no losers, \\r\\nbecause whether or not our candidates are successful, the next morning we all \\r\\nwake up as Americans. And that -- that is the greatest privilege and the most \\r\\nremarkable good fortune that can come to us on earth. With that gift also comes obligation. We are \\r\\nrequired now to work together for the good of our country. In the days ahead, we \\r\\nmust find common cause. We must join in common effort without remorse or \\r\\nrecrimination, without anger or rancor. America is in need of unity and longing \\r\\nfor a larger measure of compassion. I hope President Bush will advance those values \\r\\nin the coming years. I pledge to do my part to try to bridge the partisan \\r\\ndivide. I know this is a difficult time for my supporters, but I ask them, all \\r\\nof you, to join me in doing that. Now, more than ever, with our soldiers in harm\\'s \\r\\nway, we must stand together and succeed in Iraq and win the war on terror. I \\r\\nwill also do everything in my power to ensure that my Party, a proud Democratic \\r\\nParty, stands true to our best hopes and ideals. I believe that what we started in this campaign \\r\\nwill not end here. And I know our fight goes on to put America back to work and \\r\\nto make our economy a great engine of job growth. Our fight goes on to make \\r\\naffordable health care a[n] accessible right for all Americans, not a privilege. \\r\\nOur fight goes on to protect the environment, to achieve equality, to push the \\r\\nfrontiers of science and discovery, and to restore America\\'s reputation in the \\r\\nworld. I believe that all of this will happen -- and sooner than we may think -- \\r\\nbecause we\\'re America. And America always moves forward. I\\'ve been honored to represent the citizens of \\r\\nthis commonwealth for -- in the United States Senate now for 20 years. And I pledge to \\r\\nthem that in the years ahead, I\\'m going to fight on for the people and for the \\r\\nprinciples that I\\'ve learned and lived with here in Massachusetts. I\\'m proud of what we stood for in this campaign, \\r\\nand of what we accomplished. When we began, no one thought it was possible to \\r\\neven make this a close race. But we stood for real change, change that would \\r\\nmake a real difference in the life of our nation, the lives of our families. And \\r\\nwe defined that choice to America. I\\'ll never forget the wonderful people who came \\r\\nto our rallies, who stood in our rope lines, who put their hopes in our hands, \\r\\nwho invested in each and every one of us. I saw in them the truth that America \\r\\nis not only great, but it is good. So here -- so with a grateful heart I leave \\r\\nthis campaign with a prayer that has even greater meaning to me now that I\\'ve \\r\\ncome to know our vast country so much better. Thanks to all of you and what a \\r\\nprivilege it has been to do so. And that prayer is very simple: God bless \\r\\nAmerica. Thank you.',\n",
       " \"First of all, I thank you for that introduction. And even though it is still in the morning, I am delighted to be here, with the members of theState Dumaand theFederation Council. It is important to me to have this opportunity because the prospects for virtually every important initiativePresident Putinand I have discussed over the last two days will obviously depend upon your advice and your consent, and because through you I can speak to the citizens of Russia directly, those whom you represent. I have made five trips to Russia in my years as President. I have worked with PresidentYeltsinand now with President Putin. I have met with the leadership of the Duma on more than one occasion. I have spoken with Russia's religious leaders, with the media, with educators, scientists, and students. I have listened to Russian people tell me about their vision of the future, and I have tried to be quite open about my own vision of the future. I have come here at moments of extraordinary optimism about Russia's march toward prosperity and freedom, and I've been here at moments of great difficulty for you. I believed very strongly from the first time I came here that Russia's future fundamentally is in the hands of the Russian people. It cannot be determined by others, and it should not be. But Russia's future is very important to others, because it is among the most important journeys the world will witness in my lifetime. A great deal of the 21st century will be strongly influenced by the success of the Russian people in building a modern, strong, democratic nation that is part of the life of the rest of the world. And so, many people across the world have sought to support your efforts, sharing with you a sense of pride when democracy is advanced, and sharing your disappointment when difficulties arose. It is obviously not for me to tell the Russian people how to interpret the last few years. I know your progress has come with unfilled expectations and unexpected difficulties. I know there have been moments, especially during the financial crisis in 1998, when some wondered if the new Russia would end up as a grand social experiment gone wrong. But when we look at Russia today, we do not see an experiment gone wrong. We see an economy that is growing, producing goods and services people want. We see a nation of enterprising citizens who are beginning, despite all the obstacles, to bring good jobs and a normal life to their communities. We see a society with 65,000 nongovernmental organizations, like Eco-juris, which is helping citizens defend their rights in court, like Vozrozhdenie, which is aiding families with disabled children, like the local chambers of commerce that have sprung up all across Russia. We see a country of people taking responsibility for their future -- people like those of Gadzhiyevo on the Arctic Circle who organized a referendum to protect the environment of their town. We see a country transforming its system of higher education to meet the demands of the modern world, with institutions like the new Law Factory at Novgorod University, and theNew Economic School in Moscow. We see a country preserving its magnificent literary heritage, as the Pushkin Library is doing in its efforts to replenish the shelves of libraries all across Russia. We see a country entering the Information Age, with cutting-edge software companies, with Internet centers at universities fromKazantoUfatoYakutsk, with a whole generation of young people more connected to the outside world than any past generation could have imagined. We see Russian citizens with no illusions about the road ahead, yet voting in extraordinary numbers against a return to the past. We see a Russia that has just completed a democratic transfer of executive power for the first time in a thousand years. I would not presume to tell the people you represent how to weigh the gains of freedom against the pain of economic hardship, corruption, crime. I know the people of Russia do not yet have the Russia they were promised in 1991. But I believe you, and they, now have a realistic chance to build that kind of Russia for yourselves in far greater measure than a decade ago, because of the democratic foundations that have been laid and the choices that have been made. The world faces a very different Russia than it did in 1991. Like all countries, Russia also faces a very different world. Its defining feature is globalization, the tearing down of boundaries between people, nations and cultures, so that what happens anywhere can have an impact everywhere. During the 1990s, the volume of international trade almost doubled. Links among businesses, universities, advocacy groups, charities and churches have multiplied across physical space and cyberspace. In the developing world some of the poorest villages are beginning to be connected to the Information Superhighway in ways that are opening up unbelievable opportunities for education and for development. The Russian people did more than just about anyone else to make possible this new world of globalization, by ending the divisions of the Cold War. Now Russia, America, and all nations are subject to new rules of the global economy. One of those rules, to adapt a phrase from your history, is that it's no longer possible to build prosperity in one country alone. To prosper, our economies must be competitive in a global marketplace; and to compete, the most important resource we must develop is our own people, giving them the tools and freedom to reach their full potential. This is the challenge we have tried to meet in America over the last few years. Indeed, the changes we have seen in the global economy pose hard questions that both our nations still must answer. A fundamental question is: How do we define our strength and vitality as a nation today, and what role should government play in building it? Some people actually believe that government is no longer relevant at all to people's lives in a globalized, interconnected world. Since all of us hold government positions, I presume we disagree. But I believe experience shows that government, while it must be less bureaucratic and more oriented toward the markets, and while it should focus on empowering people by investing in education and training rather than simply accruing power for itself, it is still very important. Above all, a strong State should use its strength to reinforce the rule of law, protect the powerless against the powerful, defend democratic freedoms, including freedom of expression, religion and the press, and do whatever is possible to give everyone a chance to develop his or her innate abilities. This is true, I believe, for any society seeking to advance in the modern world. For any society in any part of the world that is increasingly small and tied together, the answer to law without order is not order without law. Another fundamental question is: How shall countries define their strength in relation to the rest of the world today? Shall we define it as the power to dominate our neighbors or the confidence to be a good neighbor? Shall we define it by what we are against, or simply in terms of what others are for? Do we join with others in common endeavors to invest -- advance common interests, or do -- do we try to bend others to our will? This federal assembly's ratification ofSTART IIand theComprehensive Test Ban Treatysuggests you are answering these questions in a way that will make for both a stronger Russia and a better world, defining your strength in terms of the achievements of your people and the power of your partnerships, and your role in world affairs. A related question for both Russia and America is: How should we define our relationship today? Clearly, Russia has entered a phase when what it needs most is outside investment, not aid. What Americans must ask is not so much what can we do for Russia, but what can we do with Russia to advance our common interests and lift people in both nations? To build that kind of relationship, we Americans have to overcome the temptation to think that we have all the answers. We have to resist the feeling that if only you would see things our way, troubles would go away. Russia will not, and indeed should not, choose a course simply because others wish you to do so. You will choose what your interests clearly demand and what your people democratically embrace. I think one problem we have is that many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you well. Thus, you tend to see our relationship in what we call zero-sum terms, assuming that every assertion of American power must diminish Russia, and every assertion of Russian strength must threaten America. That is not true. The United States wants a strong Russia, a Russia strong enough to protect its territorial integrity while respecting that of its neighbors; strong enough to meet threats to its security; to help maintain strategic stability; to join with others to meet common goals; to give its people their chance to live their dreams. Of course, our interests are not identical, and we will have our inevitable disagreements. But on many issues that matter to our people, our interests coincide. And we have an obligation, it seems to me, to focus on the goals we can and should advance together in our mutual interest, and to manage our differences in a responsible and respectful way. What can we do together in the years to come? Well, one thing we ought to do is to build a normal economic relationship, based on trade and investment between our countries and contact between our people. We have never had a better opportunity, and I hope you will do what you can to seize it. This is the time, when Russia's economy is growing and oil prices are high, when I hope Russia will create a more diversified economy. The economies that will build power in the 21st century will be built not just on resources from the soil, which are limited, but on the genius and initiative of individual citizens, which are unlimited. This is a time when I hope you will finish putting in place the institutions of a modern economy, with laws that protect property, that ensure openness and accountability, that establish an efficient, equitable tax code. Such an economy would keep Russian capital in Russia, and bring foreign capital to Russia, both necessary for the kind of investment you deserve, to create jobs for your people and new businesses for your future. This is a time to win the fight against crime and corruption, so that investment will not choose safer shores. That is why I hope you will soon pass a strong law against money laundering that meets international standards. This is also the time I hope Russia will make an all-out effort to take the needed steps to join the World Trade Organization. Membership in the WTO reinforces economic reform. It will give you better access to foreign markets. It will ensure that your trading partners treat you fairly. Russia should not be the only major industrialized country standing outside this global trading system. You should be inside this system, with China, Brazil, Japan, members of the European Union and the United States, helping to shape those rules for the benefit of all. We will support you. But you must know, too, that the decision to join the WTO requires difficult choices that only you can make. I think it is very important. Again, I will say I think you should be part of making the rules of the road for the 21st century economy, in no small measure because I know you believe in the importance of the social contract, and you understand that we cannot have a world economy unless we also have some rules that people in the world respect regarding the living standards of people -- the conditions in which our children are -- are raised, whether they have access to education, and whether we do what should be done together to protect the global environment. A second goal of our partnership should be to meet threats to our security together. The same advances that are bringing the world together are also making the tools of destruction deadlier, cheaper, and more available. As you well know, because of this openness of borders, because of the openness of the Internet, and because of the advances of technology, we are all more vulnerable to terrorism, to organized crime, to the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons -- which themselves may some day be transferred, soon, in smaller and smaller quantities, across more and more borders, by unscrupulous illegal groups working together. In such a world, to protect our security we must have more cooperation, not more competition, among like-minded nation-states. Since 1991, we have already cooperated to cut our own nuclear arsenals by 40 percent; in removing nuclear weapons from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan; in fighting illicit trafficking in deadly technology. Together, we extended theNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, banned chemical weapons, agreed to end nuclear testing, urged India and Pakistan to back away from nuclear confrontation. Yesterday, President Putin and I announced two more important steps. Each of us will destroy 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to build thousands of nuclear weapons. And we will establish a system to give each other early warning of missile tests and space launches to avoid any\\xa0 miscalculation, with a joint center here that will operate out of Moscow 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- the first permanent, joint United States-Russian military cooperation ever. I am proud of this record, and I hope you are, too. We will continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals by negotiating a START III treaty, and to secure the weapons and materials that remain. But we must be realistic. Despite our best efforts, the possibility exists that nuclear and other deadly weapons will fall into dangerous hands, into hands that could threaten us both -- rogue states, terrorists, organized criminal groups. The technology required to launch missiles capable of delivering them over long distances, unfortunately, is still spreading across the world. The question is not whether this threat is emerging; it is. The question is, what is the best way to deal with it? It is my strong preference that any response to strengthen the strategic stability and arms control regime that has served our two nations so well for decades now. If we can pursue that goal together, we will all be more secure. Now, as all of you know well, soon I will be required to decide whether the United States should deploy a limited national missile defense system designed to protect the American people against the most imminent of these threats. I will consider, as I have repeatedly said, many factors, including the nature of the threat, the cost of meeting it, the effectiveness of the available technology, and the impact of this decision on our overall security, including our relationship with Russia and other nations, and the need to preserve theABM Treaty. The system we are contemplating would not undermine Russia's deterrent, or the principles of mutual deterrence and strategic stability. That is not a question just of our intent, but of the technical capabilities of the system. But I ask you to think about this, to debate it -- as I know you will -- to determine for yourselves what the capacity of what we have proposed is -- because I learned on my trip to Russia that the biggest debate is not whether we intend to do something that will undermine mutual deterrence -- I think most people who have worked with us, not just me and others over the years, know that we find any future apart from cooperation with you in the nuclear area inconceivable. The real question is a debate over what the impact of this will be, because of the capacity of the technology involved. And I believe that is a question of fact which people of good will ought to be able to determine. And I believe we ought to be able to reach an agreement about how we should proceed at each step along the way here, in a way that preserves mutual deterrence, preserves strategic stability, and preserves the ABM Treaty. That is my goal. And if we can reach an agreement about how we're going forward, then it is something we ought to take in good faith to the Chinese, to the Japanese, to others who are interested in this, to try to make sure that this makes a safer world, not a more unstable world. I think we've made some progress, and I would urge all of you who are interested in this to carefully read the Statement of Principles to which President Putin and I agreed yesterday. Let me say that this whole debate on missile defense and the nature of the threat reflects a larger and, I think, more basic truth. As we and other nation states look out on the world today, increasingly we find that the fundamental threat to our security is not the threat that we pose to each other, but instead, threats we face in common -- threats from terrorist and rogue states, from biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons which may be able to be produced in increasingly smaller and more sophisticated ways. Public health threats, like AIDS and tuberculosis, which are now claiming millions of lives around the world, and which literally are on the verge of ruining economies and threatening the survival of some nations. The world needs our leadership in this fight as well. And when President Putin and I go to the G-8 meeting in July, I hope we can support a global strategy against infectious disease. There is a global security threat caused by environmental pollution and global warming. We must meet it with strong institutions at home and with leadership abroad. Fortunately, one of the benefits of the globalized Information Age is that it is now possible to grow an economy without destroying the environment. Thanks to incredible advances in science and technology over the last 10 years, a whole new aspect in economic growth has opened up. It only remains to see whether we are wise enough to work together to do this, because the United States does not have the right to ask any nation -- not Russia, not China, not India -- to give up future economic growth to combat the problem of climate change. What we do have is the opportunity to persuade every nation, including people in our own country who don't yet believe it, that we can grow together in the 21st century and actually reduce greenhouse gases at the same time. I think a big part of making that transition benefits Russia, because of your great stores of natural gas. And so I hope we will be working closely together on this in the years ahead. In the Kyoto climate change treaty, we committed ourselves to tie market forces to the fight against global warming. And today, on thisWorld Environment Day, I'm pleased that President Putin and I have agreed to deepen our own cooperation on climate change. This is a huge problem. If we don't deal with this within just a few years, you will have island nations flooded; you will have the agricultural balance of most countries completely changed; you will have a dramatic increase in the number of severe, unmanageable weather events. And the good news is that we can now deal with this problem -- again I say, and strengthen our economic growth, not weaken it. A third challenge that demands our engagement is the need to build a world that is less divided along ethnic, racial, and religious lines. It is truly ironic, I think, that we can go anywhere in the world and have the same kinds of conversations about the nature of the global information society. Not long ago, I was in India in a poor village, meeting with a women's milk cooperative. And the thing they wanted me to see was that they had computerized all their records. And then I met with the local village council, and the thing they wanted me to see in this remote village, in a nation with a per capita income of only 450 dollars a year, was that all the information that the federal and state government had that any citizen could ever want was on a computer in the public building in this little village. And I watched a mother that had just given birth to a baby come into this little public building and call up the information about how to care for the child, and then print it out on her computer, so that she took home with her information every bit as good as a -- a well-to-do American mother could get from her doctor about how to care for a child in the first six months. It is truly ironic that at a time when we're living in this sort of world with all these modern potentials, that we are grappling with our oldest problems of human society -- our\\xa0 tendency to fear, and then to hate people who are different from us. We see it from Northern Ireland to the Middle East to the tribal conflicts of Africa, to the Balkans and many other places on this Earth. Russia and America should be concerned about this because the stability of both of our societies depends upon people of very different ethnic, racial, and religious groups learning to live together under a common framework of rules. And history teaches us that harmony that lasts among such different people cannot be maintained by force alone. I know when trying to come to grips with these problems, these old problems of the modern world, the United States have -- and Russia have faced some of our greatest difficulties in the last few years. I know you disagreed with what I did inKosovo, and you know that I disagreed with what you did inChechnya. I have always said that the Russian people and every other people have a right to combat terrorism and to preserve the integrity of their nations. I still believe it, and I reaffirmed that today. My question in Chechnya was an honest one and the question of a friend, and that is whether any war can be won that requires large numbers of civilian casualties and has no political component bringing about a solution. Let me say, in Kosovo my position was whether we could ever preserve a democratic and free Europe unless Southeastern Europe were a part of it, and whether any people could ever say that everyone is entitled to live in peace if 800,000 people were driven out of a place they had lived in for centuries solely because of their religion. None of these questions will be easy, but I think we ought to ask ourselves whether we are trying to resolve them. I remember going to Kosovo after the conflict, after Russians and Americans had agreed to serve there together as we have served in Bosnia effectively together, and sitting down with all the people who represented the conflict around the table. They would hardly speak to each other. They were still angry; they were still thinking about their family members that had been dislocated and killed. And -- And, so I said to them that I had just been involved in negotiating the end of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and that I was very close to the Irish conflict because all of my -- my relatives came from a little village in Ireland that was right on the border between the North and the South, and therefore, had lived through all these years of conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants. And I said, now here's the deal we got. The deal is majority rule, minority rights, guaranteed participation in decision-making, shared economic and other benefits. Majority rule; minority rights; guaranteed participation in decision-making; shared economic and other benefits. I said, now, it's a good deal, but what I would like to tell you is that if they had ever stopped fighting, they could have gotten this deal years ago. And so I told the people of Kosovo, I said, you know, everybody around this table has got a legitimate grievance. People on all sides, you can tell some story that is true, and has -- is legitimately true. Now, you can make up your mind to bear this legitimate grievance with a grudge for 20 or 30 years. And 20 or 30 years from now, someone else will be sitting in these chairs, and they will make a deal -- majority rule, minority rights, shared decision-making, shared economic and other benefits. You can make the deal now, or you can wait. Those of us who are in a position of strong and stable societies, we have to say this to people. We have to get people with -- not just the people who have been wronged, everybody's got a legitimate grievance in these cauldrons of -- of ethnic and racial and religious turmoil. But it's something we have to think about. And as we see a success story, it's something I think we ought to look for other opportunities to advance. Real peace in life comes not when you give up the feelings you have that are wrong, but when you give up the feelings you have that are right, in terms of having been wronged in the past. That's how people finally come together and go on. And those of us who lead big countries should take that position and try to work through it. Let me say, finally, a final security goal that I have, related to all the others, is to help Europe build a community that is democratic, at peace, and without divisions -- one that includes Russia, and strengthens our ability to advance our common interests. We have never had that kind of Europe before in all history. So building it will require changing old patterns of thinking. I was in Germany a couple of days ago in the historical town of Aachen, whereCharlemagnehad his European empire in the late 8th and early 9th century, to talk about that. There are, I know, people who resist the idea that Russia should be part of Europe, and who insist that Russia is fundamentally different from the other nations that are building a united Europe. Of course, there are historical and cultural arguments that support that position. And it's a good thing that you're different and that we're different; it makes life more interesting. But the differences between Russia and France, for example, may not be any greater than those between Sweden and Spain, or England and Greece, or even between America and Europe. Integration within Europe and then the transatlantic alliance came about because people who are different came together, not because people who are the same came together. Estrangement between Russia and the West, which lasted too long, was not because of our inherent differences, but because we made choices in how we defined our interests and our belief systems. We now have the power to choose a different and a better future. We can do that by integrating our economies, making common cause against common threats, promoting ethnic and religious tolerance and human rights. We can do it by making sure that none of the institutions*of European and*transatlantic unity, not any of them, are closed to Russia. You can decide whether you want to be a part of these institutions. It should be entirely your decision. And we can have the right kind of constructive partnership, whatever decision you make, as long as you know that no doors to Europe's future are closed to you, and you can then feel free to decide how best to pursue your own interests. If you choose not to pursue full membership in these institutions, then we must make sure that their Eastern borders become gateways for Russia instead of barriers to travel, trade, and security cooperation. We also should work with others to help those in Europe who still fear violence and are afraid they will not have a stable, secure future. I am proud that, together, we have made theOSCEinto an effective champion of human rights in Europe. I am pleased that President Putin and I recommitted ourselves yesterday to helping find a settlement to theNagorno-Karabakhconflict. I am proud we have, together, adapted theConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, to reduce conventional arms in Europe and eliminate the division of the continent in the military blocs. I believe it is a hopeful thing that despite our different outlook on the war in the former Yugoslavia, that our armed forces have worked there together in both Bosnia and Kosovo to keep the peace. We may still disagree about Kosovo, but now that the war is over, let me say one other thing about Yugoslavia. I believe the people of Serbia deserve to live in a normal country with the same freedoms the people of Russia and America enjoy, with relationships with their neighbors including Russia that will not constantly be interrupted by vast flows of innocent people being forced out of their country or threatened with their very lives. The struggle in Belgrade now is not between Serbia and NATO, it is between the Serbian people and their leaders. The Serbian people are asking the world to back democracy and freedom. Our response to their request does not have to be identical, but Russia and America should both be on the side of the people of Serbia. In the relationship we are building, we should try to stand abroad for the values each of us has been building at home. I know the kind of relationship that we would both like cannot be built overnight. Russia's history, like America's, teaches us well that there are no shortcuts to great achievements. But we have laid strong foundations. It has helped a great deal that so many members of our Congress has visited you here, and that a number of Duma committee chairmen have visited our Congress last month, that members of the Federation Council have been invited to come to Washington. I want to urge you, as many of you as can, to visit our country, and invite members of our Congress to visit you. Let them understand how the world looks from your perspective. Let them see how you do your jobs. Tell them what you're worried about and where you disagree with us. And give us a chance to build that base of common experience and mutual trust that is so important to our future together. All of you are always welcome to come and work with us in the United States. We have to find a mutual understanding. I also would say that the most important Russian-American relationship still should be the relationship between our peoples -- the student exchanges, the business partnerships, the collaboration among universities and foundations and hospitals, the sister city links, the growing family ties. Many of the Russians and Americans involved in these exchanges are very young. They don't even have any adult memories of the Cold War. They don't carry the burdens and baggage of the past; just the universal, normal desire to build a good future with those who share their hopes and dreams. We should do everything we can to increase these exchanges, as well. And finally, we must have a sense of responsibility for the future. We are not destined to be adversaries. But it is not guaranteed that we will be allies. For us, there is no fate waiting to be revealed, only a future waiting to be created -- by the actions we take, the choices we make, and the genuine views we have of one another and of our own future. I leave you today looking to the future with the realistic hope that we will choose wisely; that we will continue to build a relationship of mutual respect and mutual endeavor; that we will tell each other the truth with clarity and candor as we see it, always striving to find common ground, always remembering that the world we seek to bring into being can come only if America and Russia are on the same side of history. I believe we will do this, not because I know everything always turns out well, but because I know our partnership, our relationship, is fundamentally the right course for both nations. We have to learn to identify and manage our disagreements because the relationship is profoundly important to the future. The governments will -- our people elect will do what they think is right for their own people. But they know that one thing that is right is continuing to strengthen the relationship between Russia and the United States. Our children will see the result -- a result that is more prosperous and free and at peace than the world has ever known. That is what I believe we can do. I don't believe any American President's ever come to Russia five times before. I came twice before that. That's when I was a very young man and our relations were very different than they are now. All my life, I have wanted the people of my country and the people of your country to be friends and allies, to lead the world away from war toward the dreams of children. I have done my best to do that. I hope you will believe that that is the best course for both our countries, and for our children's future. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you very, \\r\\nvery much. I have many friends to thank tonight. I thank the \\r\\nvoters who supported me. I thank the gallant men who entered the contest for the \\r\\npresidency this year, and who have honored me with their support. And, for their \\r\\nkind and stirring words, I thank Governor Tom Kean of New Jersey; Senator Phil \\r\\nGramm of Texas; President Gerald Ford; and my friend, President Ronald Reagan. I accept your nomination for \\r\\nPresident. I mean -- \\r\\nI mean to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the issues -- and I mean to win. There are a lot -- There are a lot of great \\r\\nstories in politics about the underdog winning -- and this is going to be one of \\r\\nthem. And we\\'re going to win with the help of Senator \\r\\nDan Quayle of Indiana - a young leader who has become a forceful voice in \\r\\npreparing America\\'s workers for the labor force of the future. What a superb job \\r\\nhe did here tonight. Born in the middle of the century, in the middle of \\r\\nAmerica, and holding the promise of the future - I\\'m proud to have Dan Quayle at \\r\\nmy side. Many of you have asked, many of you have asked, \\r\\n\"When will this campaign really begin?\" We\\x92ll I\\x92ve come to this hall to tell \\r\\nyou, and to tell America: Tonight is the night. For seven and a half years I have helped the \\r\\nPresident conduct the most difficult job on earth. Ronald Reagan asked for, and \\r\\nreceived, my candor. He never asked for, but he did receive, my loyalty. Those \\r\\nof you who saw the President\\'s speech this week, and listened to the simple \\r\\ntruth of his words, will understand my loyalty all these years. But now -- now, you must see me for what I am: \\r\\nThe Republican candidate for President of the United States. And now I turn to \\r\\nthe American people to share my hopes and intentions, and why -- and where -- I \\r\\nwish to lead. And so tonight is for big things. But I\\'ll try \\r\\nto be fair to the other side. I\\'ll try to hold my charisma in check. And, no \\r\\nI reject the temptation to engage in personal references. My approach this \\r\\nevening is, as Sergeant Joe Friday used to say, \"Just the facts, ma\\'am.\" And after all -- after all, the facts are on our \\r\\nside. I seek the presidency for a single purpose, a \\r\\npurpose that has motivated millions of Americans across the years and the ocean \\r\\nvoyages. I seek the presidency to build a better America. It is that simple -- \\r\\nand that big. I\\x92m a man who sees life in terms of missions - \\r\\nmissions defined and missions completed. And when I was a torpedo bomber pilot \\r\\nthey defined the mission for us. And before we took off we all understood that \\r\\nno matter what, you try to reach the target. There have been other missions for \\r\\nme -- Congress, China, the CIA. But I am here tonight -- and I am your candidate \\r\\n-- \\r\\nbecause the most important work of my life is to complete the mission that we \\r\\nstarted in 1980. How do we complete it? We build on it. The stakes are high this year and the choice is \\r\\ncrucial, for the differences between the two candidates are as deep and wide as \\r\\nthey have ever been in our long history. Not only two very different men, but two very \\r\\ndifferent ideas of the future will be voted on this Election Day. And what it all comes down to is this: My opponent\\'s view of the world sees a long \\r\\nslow decline for our country, an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal \\r\\nhistorical forces. But America is not in decline. America is a \\r\\nrising nation. He sees -- He sees America as another pleasant \\r\\ncountry on the UN roll call, somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe. And I see \\r\\nAmerica as the leader - a unique nation with a special role in the world. And this has been called the American Century, \\r\\nbecause in it we were the dominant force for good in the world. We saved Europe, \\r\\ncured polio, we went to the moon, and lit the world with our culture. And now we \\r\\nare on the verge of a new century, and what country\\'s name will it bear? I say \\r\\nit will be another American century. Our work is not done -- our force is not spent. There are those who say there isn\\'t much of a \\r\\ndifference this year. But America, don\\'t let \\'em fool ya. Two parties this year ask for your support. \\r\\nBoth will speak of growth and peace. But only one has proved it can deliver. Two \\r\\nparties this year ask for your trust, but only one has earned it. Eight years ago -- Eight years ago, I stood here \\r\\nwith Ronald Reagan and we promised, together, to break with the past and return \\r\\nAmerica to her greatness. Eight years later look at what the American people \\r\\nhave produced: the highest level of economic growth in our entire history -- and \\r\\nthe lowest level of world tensions in more than fifty years. Some say -- You know, some say this isn\\'t an \\r\\nelection about ideology, it\\'s an election about competence. Well, it\\'s nice of \\r\\nthem to want to play on our field. But this election isn\\'t only about \\r\\ncompetence, for competence is a narrow ideal. Competence makes the trains run on \\r\\ntime but doesn\\'t know where they\\'re going. Competence is the creed of the \\r\\ntechnocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn\\'t for a second understand the \\r\\nmagic of the machine. The truth is -- The truth is, this election is \\r\\nabout the beliefs we share, the values that we honor, and the principles we hold \\r\\ndear. But -- But since someone brought \\r\\nup competence, consider the size of our triumph: A record \\r\\nnumber of Americans at work. A record high percentage of our people with jobs, a \\r\\nrecord high of new businesses, high rate of new businesses -- a record high rate \\r\\nof real personal income. These are the facts. And one way -- And one way, \\r\\nyou know our opponents know the facts is that to attack the record they have to \\r\\nmisrepresent it. They call it a Swiss cheese economy. Well, that\\'s the way it \\r\\nmay look to the three blind mice. But -- But, when they -- when they were in charge \\r\\nit was all holes and no cheese. Inflation was 13 percent \\r\\nwhen we came in. We got it down to four. Interest rates -- Interest rates, were \\r\\nmore than 21. We cut em\\x92 in half. Unemployment -- Unemployment was up and \\r\\nclimbing; and now it\\'s the lowest in 14 years. My friends, eight years ago this economy was \\r\\nflat on its back -- intensive care. And we came in and gave it emergency \\r\\ntreatment: And got the temperature down by lowering regulation, and got the \\r\\nblood pressure down when we lowered taxes. And pretty soon the patient was up, \\r\\nback on his feet, and stronger than ever. And now, who do we hear knocking on the door \\r\\nbut the same doctors who made him sick. And they\\'re telling us to put them in \\r\\ncharge of the case again. My friends, they\\'re lucky we don\\'t hit em\\x92 with a \\r\\nmalpractice suit! We\\'ve created -- We\\x92ve created seventeen million \\r\\nnew jobs the past five years -- more than twice as many as Europe and Japan \\r\\ncombined. And they\\'re good jobs. The majority of them created in the past six \\r\\nyears paid an average -- average of more than 22,000 dollars a year. And someone better \\r\\ntake a message to Michael: Tell him -- Tell him that we have been creating good \\r\\njobs at good wages. The fact is, they talk -- and we deliver. They promise -- They \\r\\npromise -- and we perform. And there are millions of young Americans in \\r\\ntheir 20\\'s who barely remember -- who barely remember the days of gas lines and \\r\\nunemployment lines. And now they\\'re marrying and starting careers. And to those \\r\\nyoung people I say: \"You have the opportunity you deserve -- and I\\'m not going \\r\\nto let them take it away from you.\" The leaders -- The leaders -- The leaders of this \\r\\nexpansion -- The leaders of this expansion have been the women of America who \\r\\nhelped create the new jobs and filled two out of every three of them. And to the \\r\\nwomen of America I say you know better than anyone that equality begins with \\r\\neconomic empowerment. You\\x92re gaining economic power and I\\x92m not going to let \\r\\nthem take it away from you. There are millions -- There are -- \\r\\nThere are \\r\\nmillions of Americans who were brutalized by inflation. We arrested it -- and \\r\\nwe\\'re not going to let it out on furlough. We\\x92re -- We\\'re going to -- And we\\x92re going \\r\\nto keep the social security trust fund sound, and out of reach of the big \\r\\nspenders. To America\\'s elderly I say, \"Once again, you have the security that is \\r\\nyour right -- and I\\'m not -- not going to let them take it away from you.\" I know the liberal democrats are worried about \\r\\nthe economy. They\\'re worried it\\'s going to remain strong. And they\\'re right, it is. \\r\\nWith the right leadership it will remain strong. But -- But let\\'s be frank. Things aren\\'t perfect \\r\\nin this country. There are people who haven\\'t tasted the fruits of the \\r\\nexpansion. I\\'ve talked to farmers about the bills they can\\'t pay. I\\'ve been to \\r\\nthe factories that feel the strain of change. And I\\'ve seen the urban children \\r\\nwho play amidst the shattered glass and the shattered lives. And there are the \\r\\nhomeless. And you know, it doesn\\'t do any good to debate endlessly which policy \\r\\nmistake of the \\'70\\'s is responsive. They\\'re there. And we have to help them. But what we must remember if we are to be \\r\\nresponsible -- and compassionate -- is that economic growth is the key to our \\r\\nendeavors. I want growth that stays, that broadens, that \\r\\ntouches, finally, all Americans, from the hollows of Kentucky to the sunlit \\r\\nstreets of Denver, from the suburbs of Chicago to the broad avenues of New York, \\r\\nand from the oil fields of Oklahoma to the farms of the great plains. And can we do it? Of course we can. We know \\r\\nhow. We\\'ve done it. And if we -- if we, continue to grow at our current rate, we \\r\\nwill be able to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years. And we will do \\r\\nit -- by maintaining our commitment to free and fair trade, by keeping government \\r\\nspending down, and by keeping taxes down. Our -- Our economic life is not the only test of \\r\\nour success. One issue overwhelms all the others, and that\\x92s the issue of peace. And look at the world on this bright August \\r\\nnight. The spirit of Democracy is sweeping the Pacific rim. China feels the \\r\\nwinds of change. New democracies assert themselves in South America. And one by \\r\\none the unfree places fall, not to the force of arms but to the force of an \\r\\nidea: freedom works. And we -- we have -- we have a new relationship \\r\\nwith the Soviet Union. The INF treaty -- the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal \\r\\nfrom Afghanistan -- the beginning of the end of the Soviet proxy war in Angola, \\r\\nand with it the independence of Namibia. Iran and Iraq move toward peace. It\\x92s a watershed. It is no accident. It happened when we acted on the ancient \\r\\nknowledge that strength and clarity lead to peace - weakness and ambivalence \\r\\nlead to war. Weakness and ambivalence lead to war. You see -- You see, weakness tempts aggressors. \\r\\nStrength stops them. I will not allow this country to be made weak again. Never. The tremors -- The tremors in the Soviet world \\r\\ncontinue. The hard earth there has not yet settled. Perhaps what is happening \\r\\nwill change our world forever; and perhaps not. A prudent skepticism is in \\r\\norder. And so is hope. But either way, we\\'re in an unprecedented position to \\r\\nchange the nature of our relationship. Not by preemptive concession -- but by \\r\\nkeeping our strength. Not by yielding up defense systems with nothing won in \\r\\nreturn - but by hard cool engagement in the tug and pull of diplomacy. My life -- My life has been lived in the shadow \\r\\nof war. I almost lost my life in one. And I hate war; love peace. And we have peace. And I am not going to let anyone take it away \\r\\nfrom us. Our -- Our economy is strong but not \\r\\ninvulnerable, and the peace is broad but can be broken. And now we must decide. \\r\\nWe will surely have change this year, but will it be change that moves us \\r\\nforward? Or change that risks retreat? In 1940, when I was barely more than a boy, \\r\\nFranklin Roosevelt said we shouldn\\'t change horses in midstream. My friends, these days the world moves even \\r\\nmore quickly, and now, after two great terms, a switch will be made. But when \\r\\nyou have to change horses in midstream, doesn\\'t it make sense to switch to one \\r\\nwho\\'s going the same way? An election -- An election that\\x92s about ideas \\r\\nand values is also about philosophy. And I have one. At the bright center is the individual. And \\r\\nradiating out from him or her is the family, the essential unit of closeness and \\r\\nof love. For it\\x92s the family that communicates to our children -- to the 21st \\r\\ncentury -- our culture, our religious faith, our traditions and history. From the individual to the family to the \\r\\ncommunity, and then on out to the town, the church and the school, and, still \\r\\nechoing out, to the county, the state, and the nation -- each doing only what it \\r\\ndoes well, and no more. And I believe that power must always be kept close to \\r\\nthe individual -- close to the hands that raise the family and run the home. I am guided by certain traditions. One, is that \\r\\nthere is a God and He is good, and his love, while free, has a self imposed \\r\\ncost: We must be good to one another. I believe in another tradition that is, by now, \\r\\nembedded in the national soul. It\\x92s that learning is good in and of itself. You \\r\\nknow, the mothers of the Jewish ghettos of the east would pour honey on a book \\r\\nso the children would know that learning is sweet. And the parents who settled \\r\\nHungry Kansas would take their children in from the fields when a teacher came. \\r\\nThat is our history. And there is another tradition. And that\\x92s the \\r\\nidea of community -- a beautiful word with a big meaning; though liberal \\r\\ndemocrats have an odd view of it. They see \"community\" as a limited cluster of \\r\\ninterest groups, locked in odd conformity. And in this view, the country waits \\r\\npassive while Washington sets the rules. But that\\'s not what community means \\r\\n-- not to \\r\\nme. For we\\x92re a nation of community; of thousands \\r\\nand tens of thousands of ethnic, religious, social, business, labor union, \\r\\nneighborhood, regional and other organizations, all of them varied, voluntary \\r\\nand unique. This is America: the Knights of Columbus, the \\r\\nGrange, Hadassah, the Disabled American Veterans, the Order of Ahepa, the \\r\\nBusiness and Professional Women of America, the union hall, the Bible study \\r\\ngroup, LULAC, \"Holy Name\" -- a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a \\r\\nthousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky. Does government have a place? Yes. Government \\r\\nis part of the nation of communities -- not the whole, just a part. And I do not hate government. A government that \\r\\nremembers that the people are its master is a good and needed thing. And I respect old fashioned common sense, and \\r\\nhave no great love, and I have no great love for the imaginings of social \\r\\nplanners. I like what\\'s been tested and found to be true. For instance: Should public school teachers be required to \\r\\nlead our children in the pledge of allegiance? My opponent says no -- and I say \\r\\nyes. Should society be allowed to impose the death \\r\\npenalty on those who commit crimes of extraordinary cruelty and violence? My \\r\\nopponent says no -- but I say yes. And should our children have the right to say a \\r\\nvoluntary prayer, or even observe a moment of silence in the schools? My \\r\\nopponent says no -- but I say yes. And should -- should free men and women have the \\r\\nright to own a gun to protect their home? My opponent says no -- but I say yes. And Is it right to believe in the sanctity of \\r\\nlife and protect the lives of innocent children? My opponent says no -- but I say \\r\\nyes. You see, we must -- we must change; we\\x92ve got to \\r\\nchange from abortion -- to adoption. And let me tell you this: Barbra and I have \\r\\nan adopted granddaughter. And the day of her christening we wept with joy. I \\r\\nthank God that her parents chose life. I\\x92m -- I\\'m the one who believes it is a scandal \\r\\nto give a weekend furlough to a hardened first degree killer who hasn\\'t even \\r\\nserved enough time to be eligible for parole. I\\'m the one -- I\\x92m the one who says a drug \\r\\ndealer who is responsible for the death of a policeman should be subject to \\r\\ncapital punishment. And I\\'m the one who will not raise taxes. My \\r\\nopponent -- My opponent now says -- My opponent now says he\\'ll raise them as a last \\r\\nresort, or a third resort. But when a politician talks like that, you know \\r\\nthat\\'s one resort he\\'ll be checking into. My opponent won\\'t rule out raising \\r\\ntaxes. But I will. And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I\\'ll say \\r\\nno, and they\\'ll push, and I\\'ll say no, and they\\'ll push again, and I\\'ll say, to \\r\\nthem, \"Read my lips: No new taxes.\" Let me -- Let me tell you more -- \\r\\nLet me tell you \\r\\nmore -- Let me just tell you more about the mission on jobs. My mission is: 30 in 8. Thirty million jobs in the next eight years. Every one of our children deserves a first rate \\r\\nschool. The liberal democrats want power in the hands of the federal government. \\r\\nAnd I want power in the hands of \\xa0the parents. And I will -- And I will -- I will \\r\\nencourage merit schools. I will give more kids a Head Start. And I\\'ll make it \\r\\neasier to save for college. I want a drug free America - and this will not \\r\\nbe easy to achieve. But I want to enlist the help of some people who are rarely \\r\\nincluded. Tonight, I challenge the young people of our country to shut down the \\r\\ndrug dealers around the world. Unite with us; work with us. \"Zero tolerance\" \\r\\n-- \"Zero tolerance\" isn\\'t just a policy, it\\'s an attitude. Tell them what you think of people who \\r\\nunderwrite the dealers who put poison in our society. And while you\\'re doing \\r\\nthat, my Administration will be telling the dealers: whatever we have to do \\r\\nwe\\'ll do, but your day is over, you are history. I am going to do whatever it takes to make sure \\r\\nthe disabled are included in the mainstream. For too long they\\'ve been left out. \\r\\nBut they\\'re not going to be left out anymore. And I am going to stop ocean dumping. Our \\r\\nbeaches should not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools. And \\r\\nI\\x92m going to have the FBI trace the medical wastes and we\\x92re going to punish the \\r\\npeople who dump those infected needles into our oceans, lakes and rivers. And we \\r\\nmust clean the air. We must reduce the harm done by acid rain. And I\\x92ll put incentives back into the domestic \\r\\nenergy industry, for I know from personal experience, there is no security for \\r\\nthe United States in further dependence on foreign oil. In foreign affairs, I\\x92ll continue our policy of \\r\\npeace through strength. I will move toward further cuts in the strategic and \\r\\nconventional arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union and the \\r\\nEaster Bloc and NATO. I\\x92ll modernize and preserve our technological edge; and \\r\\nthat includes strategic defense. And a priority -- a priority: ban chemical and \\r\\nbiological weapons from the face of the earth, that will be a priority with me. \\r\\nAnd I intend to speak for freedom, stand for freedom, be a patient friend to \\r\\nanyone, east or west, who will fight for freedom. It seems to me the Presidency provides an \\r\\nincomparable opportunity for \"gentle persuasion.\" And I hope to stand for a new harmony, a \\r\\ngreater tolerance. We\\'ve come far, but I think we need a new harmony among the \\r\\nraces in our country. And we\\'re on a journey into a new century, and we\\'ve got \\r\\nto leave that tired old baggage of bigotry behind. Some people who are enjoying our prosperity \\r\\nare forgetting, have forgotten what it\\'s for. But they diminish our triumph when \\r\\nthey act as if wealth is an end in itself. And there are those who have dropped their \\r\\nstandards along the way, as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to \\r\\nthe top. There\\'s graft in city hall, the greed on Wall Street; there\\'s influence \\r\\npeddling in Washington, and the small corruptions of everyday ambition. But you see, I believe public service is \\r\\nhonorable. And every time I hear that someone has breached the public trust it \\r\\nbreaks my heart. I wonder sometimes if we have forgotten who we \\r\\nare. But we\\'re the people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin called \\r\\nslavery -- and we\\'re the people who rose from the ghettos and the deserts. And we weren\\'t saints -- but we lived by \\r\\nstandards. We celebrated the individual -- but we weren\\'t self-centered. We were \\r\\npractical -- but we didn\\'t live only for material things. We believed in getting \\r\\nahead -- but blind ambition wasn\\'t our way. The fact is prosperity has a purpose. It\\x92s to \\r\\nallow us to pursue \"the better angels,\" to give us time to think and grow. \\r\\nProsperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it concrete by \\r\\ncertain acts of goodness. It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn \\r\\nhow to read -- and I thank my wife Barbara for all her work in helping people to \\r\\nread; in all her work for literacy in this country. It means -- It means teaching troubled children \\r\\nthrough your present that there\\x92s no such -- that there is such a thing as reliable \\r\\nlove. Some would say it\\'s soft and insufficiently tough to care about these \\r\\nthings. But where is it written that we must act as if we do not care, as if we \\r\\nare not moved? Well I am moved. I want a kinder, and gentler \\r\\nnation. Two men this year ask for your support. And you \\r\\nmust know us. As for me, I have held high office and done the \\r\\nwork of democracy day by day. Yes, my parents were prosperous; and their \\r\\nchildren sure were lucky. But there were lessons we had to learn about life. \\r\\nJohn Kennedy discovered poverty when he campaigned in West Virginia; there were \\r\\nchildren who had no milk. And young Teddy Roosevelt met the new America when he \\r\\nroamed the immigrant streets of New York. And I learned a few things about life \\r\\nin a place called Texas. And when I -- And when I was -- When I was working \\r\\non this part of the speech, Barbara came in and asked what I was doing, and I \\r\\nlooked up and I said I\\x92m working hard and she said, \\x93Oh dear, don\\x92t worry, \\r\\nrelax, sit back, take off your shoes, and put up your silver foot.\\x94 Now we moved to west Texas 40 years ago \\r\\n-- 40 \\r\\nyears ago this year. And the war was over, and we wanted to get out and make it \\r\\non our own. And those were exciting days. We lived in a little shotgun house, \\r\\none room for the three of us. Worked in the oil business, then started my own. In time we had six children. Moved from the \\r\\nshotgun, to a duplex apartment, to a house. And lived the dream -- high school \\r\\nfootball on Friday night, Little League, neighborhood barbecue. People don\\'t see their experience as symbolic \\r\\nof an era -- but of course we were. And so was everyone else who was taking a \\r\\nchance and pushing into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car. But the \\r\\nbig thing I learned is the satisfaction of creating jobs, which meant creating \\r\\nopportunity, which meant happy families, who in turn could do more to help \\r\\nothers and enhance their own lives. I learned that a good done by a single good \\r\\njob can be felt in ways you can\\'t imagine. It\\x92s been said that I am not the most \\r\\ncompelling speaker. And there are actually those who claim that I don\\x92t always \\r\\ncommunicate in the clearest, most concise way; but I dare them to keep it up. Go \\r\\nahead, make my 24 hour time period. Now I -- I may be -- may not be the most eloquent, \\r\\nbut I learned, that oil -- early on that eloquence won\\'t draw oil from the ground. \\r\\nAnd I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there\\'s nothing self-conscious in \\r\\nmy love of country. And I am a quiet man -- But I am a quiet man, but I hear \\r\\nthe quiet people others don\\'t. The ones who raise the family, pay the taxes, \\r\\nmeet the mortgage. And I hear them and I am moved, and their concerns are mine. A President must be many things. He must be a shrewd protector of America\\'s \\r\\ninterests; and he must be an idealist who leads those who move for a freer and \\r\\nmore democratic planet. And he must see to it that government intrudes \\r\\nas little as possible in the lives of the people; and yet remember, that it is \\r\\nright and proper that a nation\\x92s leader take\\x92s an interest in the nation\\'s \\r\\ncharacter. And he must be able to define -- and lead \\r\\n-- a \\r\\nmission. For seven and a half years, I\\x92ve worked with a \\r\\ngreat President -- I have seen what crosses that big desk. I\\x92ve seen the \\r\\nunexpected crisis that arrives in a cable in a young aide\\'s hand. And I have \\r\\nseen problems that simmer on for decades and suddenly demand resolution. And \\r\\nI\\x92ve seen modest decisions made with anguish, and crucial decisions made with \\r\\ndispatch. And so I know that what it all comes down to, \\r\\nthis election -- what it all comes down to, after all the shouting and the cheers \\r\\n-- is the man at the desk. And who should sit at the desk? My friends, I am that man. I say it -- I say it -- I say it without boast or \\r\\nbravado, I\\'ve fought for my country. I\\'ve served. I\\'ve built. And I\\x92ll go from \\r\\nthe hills to the hollows, from the cities to the suburbs to the loneliest town \\r\\non the quietest street to take our message of hope and growth for every American \\r\\nto every American. I will keep America moving forward, always \\r\\nforward -- for a better America, for an endless enduring dream and a thousand \\r\\npoints of light. This is my mission. And I will complete it. Thank you. You know one -- You know it is \\r\\ncustomary to end an address with a pledge or a saying that holds a special \\r\\nmeaning. And I\\x92ve chosen one that we all know by heart, \\r\\none that we all learned in school. And I ask everyone in this great hall to \\r\\nstand and join me in this, we all know it.',\n",
       " \"As -- As you might imagine, \\r\\n\\t\\tfor -- for Barack, running for President is nothing compared to that \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst game of basketball with my brother Craig. I -- I can't tell you how \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch it means to have Craig and my mom here tonight. Like -- Like Craig, \\r\\n\\t\\tI can feel my dad looking down on us, just as I've felt his presence in \\r\\n\\t\\tevery grace-filled moment of my life. And at six-foot-six, I've \\r\\n\\t\\toften felt like Craig was looking down on me, too -- literally. But the \\r\\n\\t\\ttruth is, both when we were kids and today, Craig wasn't looking down on \\r\\n\\t\\tme; he was watching over me. And he has been there for me every step \\r\\n\\t\\tof the way since that clear day, February, 19 months ago, when, with \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle more than our faith in each other and a hunger for change, we \\r\\n\\t\\tjoined my husband, Barack Obama, on the improbable journey that has led \\r\\n\\t\\tus to this moment. But each of us comes here \\r\\n\\t\\talso by way of our own improbable journey. I come here tonight as a \\r\\n\\t\\tsister, blessed with a brother who is my mentor, my protector, and my \\r\\n\\t\\tlifelong friend. And I come here as a wife who loves my husband and \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieves he will be an extraordinary President. And I come here as a mom -- \\r\\n\\t\\tas a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. They're the first things I think about when I wake up in the \\r\\n\\t\\tmorning and the last thing I think about before I go to bed at night. \\r\\n\\t\\tTheir future -- and all our children's future -- is my stake in this \\r\\n\\t\\telection. And I come here as a \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughter, raised on the South Side of Chicago by a father who was a \\r\\n\\t\\tblue-collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother \\r\\n\\t\\tand me. My mother's love has always been a sustaining force for our \\r\\n\\t\\tfamily, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity, her \\r\\n\\t\\tcompassion, her intelligence reflected in my daughters. My dad was our rock. And although he was \\r\\n\\t\\tdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early 30s, he was our provider. \\r\\n\\t\\tHe was our champion, our hero. But as he got sicker, it got harder for \\r\\n\\t\\thim to walk, took him longer to get dressed in the morning, you know. But if he \\r\\n\\t\\twas in pain, he never let on. He never stopped smiling and laughing, \\r\\n\\t\\teven while struggling to button his shirt, even while using two canes to \\r\\n\\t\\tget himself across the room to give my mom a kiss. He just woke up a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle earlier and he worked a little harder. He and my mom poured \\r\\n\\t\\teverything they had into me and Craig. It was the greatest gift a child \\r\\n\\t\\tcould receive, never doubting for a single minute that you're loved and \\r\\n\\t\\tcherished and have a place in this world. And thanks to their faith and \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir hard work, we both were able to go to college. So I know \\r\\n\\t\\tfirsthand, from their lives and mine, that the American Dream endures. And you know, what struck me \\r\\n\\t\\twhen I first met Barack was that even though he had this funny name, and \\r\\n\\t\\teven though he had grown up all the way across the continent in Hawaii, \\r\\n\\t\\this family was so much like mine. He was raised by grandparents who were \\r\\n\\t\\tworking-class folks just like my parents, and by a single mother who \\r\\n\\t\\tstruggled to pay the bills just like we did. And like my family, they \\r\\n\\t\\tscrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never \\r\\n\\t\\thad for themselves. And Barack and I were raised \\r\\n\\t\\twith so many of the same values, like you work hard for what you want in \\r\\n\\t\\tlife; that your word is your bond; that you do what you say you're going \\r\\n\\t\\tto do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't \\r\\n\\t\\tknow them and even if you don't agree with them. And Barack and I set out to \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild lives guided by these values and to pass them on to the next \\r\\n\\t\\tgeneration, because we want our children and all children in this nation \\r\\n\\t\\tto know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the \\r\\n\\t\\treach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. And as our friendship grew \\r\\n\\t\\tand I learned more about Barack, he introduced me to work -- the work that he'd \\r\\n\\t\\tdone when he first moved to Chicago after college. You see, instead of \\r\\n\\t\\theading to Wall Street, Barack went to work in neighborhoods that had \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen devastated by the closing of steel plants. Jobs dried up. And \\r\\n\\t\\tBarack was invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods \\r\\n\\t\\tabout how to rebuild their community. And the people gathered there together that day were ordinary folks doing the \\r\\n\\t\\tbest they could to build a good life. See, they were parents trying to \\r\\n\\t\\tget by from paycheck to paycheck; grandparents trying to get it together \\r\\n\\t\\ton a fixed income; men frustrated that they couldn't support their \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies after jobs had disappeared. You see, those folks weren't \\r\\n\\t\\tasking for a handout or a shortcut. See, they were ready to work. They \\r\\n\\t\\twanted to contribute. They believed, like you and I believe, that \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica should be a place where you can make it if you try. And Barack stood up that \\r\\n\\t\\tday, and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since. He talked \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the world as it is and the world as it should be. And he said that \\r\\n\\t\\tall too often we accept the distance between the two, and we settle for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world as it is, even when it doesn't reflect our values and \\r\\n\\t\\taspirations. But he reminded us that we \\r\\n\\t\\talso know what the world should like -- look like. He said we know what \\r\\n\\t\\tfairness and justice and opportunity look like, and he urged us to \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve in ourselves, to find the strength within ourselves to strive \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the world as it should be. And isn't that the great American story? It's the story of men and \\r\\n\\t\\twomen gathered in churches and union halls, in high school gyms, and \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople who stood up and marched and risked everything they had, refusing \\r\\n\\t\\tto settle, determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd it's because of their will and determination that this week we \\r\\n\\t\\tcelebrate two anniversaries: the 88th anniversary of women winning the \\r\\n\\t\\tright to vote -- and the 45th anniversary -- and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day whenDr. King lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation. And I stand here today at \\r\\n\\t\\tthe crosscurrents of that history, knowing that my piece of the American \\r\\n\\t\\tdream is a blessing hard-won by those who came before me, all of them \\r\\n\\t\\tdriven by the same conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early each \\r\\n\\t\\tday to painstakingly dress himself for work, the same conviction that \\r\\n\\t\\tdrives the men and women I've met all across this country: People who work the day \\r\\n\\t\\tshift, then kiss their kids good night and head out for the night shift \\r\\n\\t\\twithout disappointment, without regret. See, that good-night kiss is a \\r\\n\\t\\treminder of everything they're working for. The military families who \\r\\n\\t\\tsay grace each night with an empty seat at the table. The servicemen -- The \\r\\n\\t\\tservicemen and\\xa0 women \\r\\n\\t\\twho love this country so much, they leave those they love most to defend \\r\\n\\t\\tit. The young people across \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica serving our communities, teaching children, cleaning up \\r\\n\\t\\tneighborhoods, caring for the least among us, each and every day. People like Hillary Clinton \\r\\n\\t\\t-- who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little \\r\\n\\t\\thigher. People like Joe Biden -- who \\r\\n\\t\\thas never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for \\r\\n\\t\\tfolks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their \\r\\n\\t\\tside again. All of us driven by the \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple belief that the world as it is just won't do; that we have an \\r\\n\\t\\tobligation to fight for the world as it should be. And that is the thread that \\r\\n\\t\\tconnects our hearts. That is the thread that runs through my journey and \\r\\n\\t\\tBarack's journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought \\r\\n\\t\\tus here tonight, where the current of history meets this new tide of \\r\\n\\t\\thope. And you see, that is why I love this country. And in my own life -- in my \\r\\n\\t\\town life, in my own small way, I have tried to give back to this country \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has given me so much. See, that's why I left a job at a big law \\r\\n\\t\\tfirm for a career in public service, working to empower young people to \\r\\n\\t\\tvolunteer in their communities, because I believe that each of us -- no \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter what our age or background or our walk in life -- each of us has \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething to contribute to the life of this nation. And it's a belief Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tshares, a belief at the heart of his life's work. See, it's what he did \\r\\n\\t\\tall those years ago in Chicago, setting up job training to get people \\r\\n\\t\\tback to work and after-school programs to keep kids safe; working block \\r\\n\\t\\tby block to help people lift up their families. It's what he did in the \\r\\n\\t\\tIllinois Senate, moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts \\r\\n\\t\\tfor hardworking families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal \\r\\n\\t\\twork. It's what he's done in the United States Senate, fighting to \\r\\n\\t\\tensure that the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust with medals and parades, but with good jobs and benefits and health \\r\\n\\t\\tcare, including mental health care. See, that's why Barack's \\r\\n\\t\\trunning: to end the war in Iraq responsibly; to build an economy that \\r\\n\\t\\tlifts every family; to make sure health care is available for every \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican; and to make sure that every single child in this nation has a \\r\\n\\t\\tworld-class education all the way from preschool to college. That's what \\r\\n\\t\\tBarack will -- Obama will do as President of the United States of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica. He'll achieve these goals \\r\\n\\t\\tthe same way he always has: by bringing us together and reminding us how \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch we share and how alike we really are. You see, Barack doesn't care \\r\\n\\t\\twhere you're from or what your background is or what party, if any, you \\r\\n\\t\\tbelong to. See, that's just not how he \\r\\n\\t\\tsees the world. He knows that thread that connects us: our belief in \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica's promise, our commitment to our children's future -- he knows \\r\\n\\t\\tthat that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even \\r\\n\\t\\twhen we disagree. It was strong enough to \\r\\n\\t\\tbring hope to those neighborhoods in Chicago. It was strong enough to \\r\\n\\t\\tbring hope to the mother he met who was worried about her child in Iraq; \\r\\n\\t\\thope to the man who's unemployed and can't afford gas to find a job; \\r\\n\\t\\thope to the student working nights to pay for her sister's health care, \\r\\n\\t\\tsleeping just a few hours a day. And it was strong enough to \\r\\n\\t\\tbring hope to people who came out on a cold Iowa night -- and became the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst voices in this chorus for change that has been echoed by millions \\r\\n\\t\\tof Americans from every corner of this nation -- millions of Americans \\r\\n\\t\\twho know that Barack understands their dreams; millions of Americans who \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that Barack will fight for people like them and that Barack will \\r\\n\\t\\tbring finally the change that we need. And in the end -- And in the \\r\\n\\t\\tend, after all that's happened these past 19 months, see, the Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tObama I know today is the same man I fell in love with 19 years ago. \\r\\n\\t\\tHe's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the \\r\\n\\t\\thospital 10 years ago this summer, inching along at a snail's pace -- \\r\\n\\t\\tpeering at us anxiously at the -- through the rear-view mirror, feeling \\r\\n\\t\\tthe whole weight of her future in his hands, determined to give her \\r\\n\\t\\teverything he'd struggled so hard for himself, determined to give her \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething he never had: the affirming embrace of a father's love. And as I tuck that little \\r\\n\\t\\tgirl in -- as I tuck that little girl in and her little sister into bed \\r\\n\\t\\tat night, you see, I -- I think about how one day, they'll have families of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir own and how one day, they -- and your sons and daughters -- will \\r\\n\\t\\ttell their own children about what we did together in this election. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey'll tell them -- They'll tell them how this time, we listened to our \\r\\n\\t\\thopes instead of our fears; how this time -- how this time, we decided \\r\\n\\t\\tto stop doubting and to start dreaming; how this time, in this great \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry -- where a girl from the South Side of Chicago can go to college \\r\\n\\t\\tand law school, and the son of a single mother from Hawaii can go all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way to the White House -- that we committed ourselves -- we \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitted ourselves to building the world as it should be. So tonight, in honor of my \\r\\n\\t\\tfather's memory and my daughters' future, out of gratitude for those \\r\\n\\t\\twhose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices \\r\\n\\t\\thave brought us to this moment, let us devote ourselves to finishing \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir work; let us work together to fulfill their hopes; and let's stand \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether to elect Barack Obama President of the United States of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica. Thank you. God bless you, \\r\\n\\t\\tand God bless America.\",\n",
       " 'I appreciate President Castro\\'s invitation for us\\r\\nto visit Cuba, and have been delighted with the\\xa0\\r\\nhospitality we have received since arriving here.\\r\\nIt is a great honor to address the Cuban people. After a long and agonizing struggle, Cuba\\r\\nachieved its independence a century ago, and a\\r\\ncomplex relationship soon developed between\\r\\nour two countries. The great powers in Europe\\r\\nand Asia viewed \"imperialism\" as the natural\\r\\norder of the time and they expected the United\\r\\nStates to colonize Cuba as the Europeans had\\r\\ndone in Africa. The United States chose instead\\r\\nto help Cuba become independent, but not\\r\\ncompletely. The Platt Amendment gave my\\r\\ncountry the right to intervene in Cuba\\'s internal\\r\\naffairs until President Franklin Roosevelt had the\\r\\nwisdom to repeal this claim in May 1934. The\\r\\ndictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown more than 43 years ago, and a few\\r\\nyears later the Cuban revolution aligned with the Soviet Union in the Cold\\r\\nWar. Since then, our nations have followed different\\r\\nphilosophical and political paths. The hard\\r\\ntruth is that neither the United States nor Cuba has managed to define a\\r\\npositive and beneficial relationship. Will this new century find our neighboring\\r\\npeople living in harmony and friendship? I have come here in search of\\r\\nan answer to that question. There\\r\\nare some in Cuba who think the simple answer is for the United States to\\r\\nlift the embargo, and there are some in my country who believe the answer\\r\\nis for your president to step down from power and allow free elections.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the question deserves a more comprehensive assessment. I have\\r\\nrestudied the complicated history (in preparation for my\\r\\nconversations with President Castro), and realize that there are no simple answers. I did\\r\\nnot come here to interfere in Cuba\\'s internal affairs, but to extend a hand of\\r\\nfriendship to the Cuban people and to offer a vision of the future for our two\\r\\ncountries and for all the Americas. That\\r\\nvision includes a Cuba fully integrated into a democratic hemisphere,\\r\\nparticipating in a Free Trade Area of the Americas and with our citizens traveling\\r\\nwithout restraint to visit each other. I want a massive student exchange\\r\\nbetween our universities. I want the people of the United States and Cuba to\\r\\nshare more than a love of baseball and wonderful music. I want us to\\r\\nbe friends, and to respect each other. Our two\\r\\nnations have been trapped in a destructive state of belligerence for 42\\r\\nyears, and it is time for us to change our relationship and the way we think\\r\\nand talk about each other. Because the United States is the most powerful\\r\\nnation, we should take the first step. First,\\r\\nmy hope is that the Congress will soon act to permit unrestricted travel\\r\\nbetween the United States and Cuba, establish open trading\\r\\nrelationships, and repeal the embargo. I should add that these restraints are not the\\r\\nsource of Cuba\\'s economic problems. Cuba can trade with more than\\r\\n100 countries, and buy medicines, for example, more cheaply in Mexico\\r\\nthan in the United States. But the embargo freezes the existing impasse,\\r\\ninduces anger and resentment, restricts the freedoms of U.S. citizens,\\r\\nand makes it difficult for us to exchange ideas and respect. Second,\\r\\nI hope that Cuba and the United States can resolve the 40-year-old\\r\\nproperty disputes with some creativity. In many cases, we are debating\\r\\nancient claims about decrepit sugar mills, an antique telephone company,\\r\\nand many other obsolete holdings. Most U.S. companies have already\\r\\nabsorbed the losses, but some others want to be paid, and many Cubans who\\r\\nfled the revolution retain a sentimental attachment for their homes. We\\r\\nresolved similar problems when I normalized relations with China in\\r\\n1979. I propose that our two countries establish a blue-ribbon commission\\r\\nto address the legitimate concerns of all sides in a positive and\\r\\nconstructive manner. Third,\\r\\nsome of those who left this beautiful island have demonstrated vividly\\r\\nthat the key to a flourishing economy is to use individual entrepreneurial skills. But many Cubans in South Florida remain angry over their\\r\\ndeparture and their divided families. We need to define a future so they can\\r\\nserve as a bridge of reconciliation between Cuba and the United\\r\\nStates. Are such\\r\\nnormal relationships possible? I believe they are. Except\\r\\nfor the stagnant relations between the United States and Cuba, the world has\\r\\nbeen changing greatly, and especially in Latin America and the Caribbean.\\r\\nAs late as 1977, when I became president, there were only two democracies\\r\\nin South America, and one in Central America. Today, almost\\r\\nevery country in the Americas is a democracy. I am not\\r\\nusing a U.S. definition of \"democracy.\" The term is embedded in the\\r\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which Cuba signed in 1948, and it was\\r\\ndefined very precisely by all the other countries of the Americas in the\\r\\nInter-American Democratic Charter last September. It is based on some simple\\r\\npremises: all citizens are born with the right to choose their own\\r\\nleaders, to define their own destiny, to speak freely, to organize political\\r\\nparties, trade unions and nongovernmental groups, and to have fair and\\r\\nopen trials. Only\\r\\nsuch governments can be members of the OAS, join a Free Trade Area of the\\r\\nAmericas, or participate in the Summits of the Americas. Today, any\\r\\nregime that takes power by unconstitutional means will be ostracized,\\r\\nas was shown in the rejection of the Venezuelan coup last month. Democracy is a framework that permits a people to accommodate changing\\r\\ntimes and correct past mistakes. Since our independence, the United\\r\\nStates has rid itself of slavery, granted women the right to vote, ended\\r\\nalmost a century of legal racial discrimination, and just this year reformed\\r\\nits election laws to correct problems we faced in Florida 18 months ago. Cuba has\\r\\nadopted a socialist government where one political party dominates,\\r\\nand people are not permitted to organize any opposition movements.\\r\\nYour constitution recognizes freedom of speech and\\r\\nassociation, but other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the\\r\\ngovernment. My\\r\\nnation is hardly perfect in human rights. A very large number of our citizens\\r\\nare incarcerated in prison, and there is little doubt that the death penalty is\\r\\nimposed most harshly on those who are poor, black, or mentally ill. For\\r\\nmore than a quarter-century, we have struggled unsuccessfully to guarantee\\r\\nthe basic right of universal health care for our people. Still, guaranteed\\r\\ncivil liberties offer every citizen an opportunity to change these laws. That\\r\\nfundamental right is also guaranteed to Cubans. It is gratifying to note that\\r\\nArticles 63 and 88 of your constitution allows citizens to petition the\\r\\nNational Assembly to permit a referendum to change laws if 10,000 or more\\r\\ncitizens sign it. I am informed that such an effort, called the Varela Project,\\r\\nhas gathered sufficient signatures and has presented such a petition to\\r\\nthe National Assembly. When Cubans exercise this freedom to change laws\\r\\npeacefully by a direct vote, the world will see that Cubans, and not\\r\\nforeigners, will decide the future of this country. Cuba has\\r\\nsuperb systems of health care and universal education, but last month, most\\r\\nLatin American governments joined a majority in the United Nations\\r\\nHuman Rights Commission in calling on Cuba to meet universally accepted\\r\\nstandards in civil liberties. I would ask that you permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisons and that you would\\r\\nreceive the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner to address such issues as\\r\\nprisoners of conscience and the treatment of inmates. These visits\\r\\ncould help refute any unwarranted criticisms. Public\\r\\nopinion surveys show that a majority of people in the United States would like\\r\\nto see the economic embargo ended, normal travel between our two\\r\\ncountries, friendship between our people, and Cuba to be welcomed\\r\\ninto the community of democracies in the Americas. At the same time,\\r\\nmost of my fellow citizens believe that the issues of economic and\\r\\npolitical freedom need to be addressed by the Cuban people. After 43\\r\\nyears of animosity, we hope that someday soon, you can reach across the\\r\\ngreat divide that separates our two countries and say, \"We are ready to\\r\\njoin the community of democracies,\" and I hope that Americans will soon\\r\\nopen our arms to you and say, \"We welcome you as our friends.\"',\n",
       " 'Thank you all. Thank you so much. You know...it\\x92s hard to believe thatit \\r\\n\\t\\thas been eight yearssince I first came to this convention to talk with \\r\\n\\t\\tyou about why I thought my husband should be President. Remember how I told you about his character and conviction, his decency \\r\\n\\t\\tand his grace -- the traits that we\\x92ve seen every day that he\\x92s served our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry in the White House. I also told you about our daughters, how they are the heart of our \\r\\n\\t\\thearts, the center of our world. And during our time in the White House, \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92ve had the joy of watching them grow from bubbly little girls into \\r\\n\\t\\tpoised young women -- a journey that started soon after we arrived in \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington. When they set off for their first day at their new school, I will never \\r\\n\\t\\tforget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just 7 and 10 years \\r\\n\\t\\told, pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns. And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only \\r\\n\\t\\tthing I could think was: What have we done? See, because at that moment I realized that our time in the White House \\r\\n\\t\\twould form the foundation for who they would become; and how well we \\r\\n\\t\\tmanaged this experience could truly make or break them. That is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our \\r\\n\\t\\tgirls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight -- how \\r\\n\\t\\twe urge them to ignore those who question their father\\x92scitizenshiporfaith; how we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on \\r\\n\\t\\tTV does not represent the true spirit of this country; how we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t stoop to their level. No, our motto is: \"When they go low, we go \\r\\n\\t\\thigh.\" With -- With every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids \\r\\n\\t\\tare watching us. We as parents are their most important role models. And \\r\\n\\t\\tlet me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident and First Lady because we know that our words and actions \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country -- \\r\\n\\t\\tkids -- kids who tell us, \"I saw you on TV.\" \"I wrote a report on you for school.\" Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes \\r\\n\\t\\twide with hope, and he wondered, \"Is my hair like yours?\" And make no mistake about it. This November when we go to the polls that \\r\\n\\t\\tis what we\\x92re deciding -- not Democrat or Republican, not left or right. \\r\\n\\t\\tNo, in this election, and every election, is about who will have the power \\r\\n\\t\\tto shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives. And I -- I am here tonight because in this election there is only one person \\r\\n\\t\\twho I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is \\r\\n\\t\\ttruly qualified to be President of the United States. And that is our \\r\\n\\t\\tfriend: Hillary Clinton! That\\x92s right. See, I trust -- I trust Hillary to lead this country because I\\x92ve seen her lifelong \\r\\n\\t\\tdevotion to our nation\\x92s children, not just her own daughter, who she \\r\\n\\t\\thas raised to perfection, but -- but\\xa0 every child who needs a champion: kids who take the long way to \\r\\n\\t\\tschool to avoid the gangs; kids who wonder how they\\x92ll ever afford \\r\\n\\t\\tcollege; kids whose parents don\\x92t speak a word of English, but dream of \\r\\n\\t\\ta better life; kids who look to us to determine who and what they can \\r\\n\\t\\tbe. You see, Hillary has spent decades doing the relentless, thankless work \\r\\n\\t\\tto actually make a difference in their lives -- advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer, fighting for \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren\\x92s health care as First Lady, and for quality child care in the \\r\\n\\t\\tSenate. And when she didn\\x92t win the nomination eight years ago, she didn\\x92t get \\r\\n\\t\\tangry or disillusioned. She --\\r\\n\\t\\tHillary did not -- Hillary did not pack up and go home, because as a true public servant \\r\\n\\t\\tHillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and \\r\\n\\t\\tdisappointments.\\r\\n\\t\\tSo she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as secretary \\r\\n\\t\\tof state, traveling the globe to keep our kids safe. And look, there were plenty of moments when Hillary could have decided \\r\\n\\t\\tthat this work was too hard, that the price of public service was too \\r\\n\\t\\thigh, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how \\r\\n\\t\\tshe talks or even how she laughs. But here\\x92s the thing. What I admire \\r\\n\\t\\tmost about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure. She -- She never \\r\\n\\t\\ttakes the easy way out. And Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything \\r\\n\\t\\tin her life. And when I think about the kind of President that I want for my girls \\r\\n\\t\\tand all our children, that\\x92s what I want.\\r\\n\\t\\tI want someone with the proven strength to persevere, someone who knows \\r\\n\\t\\tthis job and takes it seriously, someone who understands that the issues \\r\\n\\t\\ta President faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to \\r\\n\\t\\t140 characters. Look, because -- because when -- when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary in your command, you can\\x92t make snap decisions; you -- you can\\x92t have \\r\\n\\t\\ta thin skin or a tendency to lash out. You need to be steady and \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasured and well-informed. I want a President with a record of public service -- someone whose life\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\twork shows our children that we don\\x92t chase fame and fortune for \\r\\n\\t\\tourselves. We fight to give everyone a chance to succeed. And -- And we give back even when we\\x92re struggling ourselves because we know \\r\\n\\t\\tthat there is always someone worse off. And, \"There but for the grace of \\r\\n\\t\\tGod go I.\" I want a President who will teach our children that everyone in this \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry matters, a President who truly believes in the vision that our \\r\\n\\t\\tFounders put forth all those years ago that we are all created equal, \\r\\n\\t\\teach a beloved part of the great American story. And when crisis hits, we don\\x92t turn against each other. No, we -- we listen to \\r\\n\\t\\teach other; we lean on each other, because we are always stronger \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether. And I am here tonight because I know that that is the kind of President \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Hillary Clinton will be. And that\\x92s why in this election I\\x92m with \\r\\n\\t\\ther. You see, Hillary understands that the President is about one thing and \\r\\n\\t\\tone thing only: It\\x92s about leaving something better for our kids. That\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\thow we\\x92ve always moved this country forward -- by all of us coming \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether on behalf of our children, folks who volunteer to coach that \\r\\n\\t\\tteam, to teach that Sunday school class, because they knowit takes a \\r\\n\\t\\tvillage: heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty; police officers \\r\\n\\t\\tand the protesters in Dallas who all desperately want to keep our \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren safe; people who lined up in Orlando to donate blood because it \\r\\n\\t\\tcould have been their son, their daughter in that club. Leaders like Tim Kaine -- who show -- who show our kids what decency and devotion look like. Leaders like Hillary Clinton -- who has the guts and the grace to keep \\r\\n\\t\\tcoming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest glass \\r\\n\\t\\tceiling until she finally breaks through, lifting all of us along with \\r\\n\\t\\ther. That is the story of this country -- the story that has brought me to this \\r\\n\\t\\tstage tonight; the story of generations of people who felt the lash of \\r\\n\\t\\tbondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept \\r\\n\\t\\ton striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I \\r\\n\\t\\twake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.\\r\\n\\t\\tAnd...I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women \\r\\n\\t\\tplaying with their dogs on the White House lawn. And -- And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters, and all our sons and \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughters, now take for granted that a woman can be President of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States. So look -- So don\\x92t let anyone ever tell you that this country isn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right \\r\\n\\t\\tnow is the greatest country on earth. And as my -- my daughters prepare to set out into the world, I want a leader \\r\\n\\t\\twho is worthy of that truth, a leader who is worthy of my girls\\x92 promise \\r\\n\\t\\tand all our kids\\x92 promise, a leader who will be guided every day by the \\r\\n\\t\\tlove and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren. So in this election, we cannot sit back and hope that everything works \\r\\n\\t\\tout for the best. We cannot afford to be tired or frustrated or cynical. No, hear me! Between now and November, we need to do what we did eight \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago and four years ago. We need to knock on every door! We need to get out every vote! We need \\r\\n\\t\\tto pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love \\r\\n\\t\\tfor this country into electing Hillary Clinton as President of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States of America. So let\\'s get to work. Thank you all. And God bless.',\n",
       " 'In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies. But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.It is the principle which permits a state, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other states.Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that \"might is right\"; and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. But far more than this -- the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended.This is the ultimate issue which confronts us. For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God. If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God\\'s help, we shall prevail. May He bless and keep us all.',\n",
       " 'Thank you, President and \\r\\n\\t\\tMrs. Clinton and Chelsea, for being here today. You\\'ve shown \\r\\n\\t\\textraordinary kindness throughout the course of this week. Once, when they \\tasked John what he would do if he went into politics and was \\telected president, he said: \"I guess the first thing is call up \\tUncle Teddy and gloat.\" I loved that. It was so like his father. From the first day \\tof his life, John seemed to belong not only to our family, but \\tto the American family. The whole world knew \\this name before he did. A famous photograph \\tshowed John racing across the lawn as his father landed in the \\tWhite House helicopter and swept up John in his arms. When my \\tbrother saw that photo, he exclaimed, \"Every mother in the \\tUnited States is saying, \\'Isn\\'t it wonderful to see that love \\tbetween a son and his father, the way that John races to be with \\this father.\\' Little do they know -- that son would have raced \\tright by his father to get to that helicopter.\" But John was so much \\tmore than those long ago images emblazoned in our minds. He was \\ta boy who grew into a man with a zest for life and a love of \\tadventure. He was a pied piper who brought us all along. He was \\tblessed with a father and mother who never thought anything \\tmattered more than their children. When they left the \\tWhite House, Jackie\\'s soft and gentle voice and unbreakable \\tstrength of spirit guided him surely and securely to the future. \\tHe had a legacy, and he learned to treasure it. He was part of a \\tlegend, and he learned to live with it. Above all, Jackie gave \\thim a place to be himself, to grow up, to laugh and cry, to \\tdream and strive on his own. John learned that \\tlesson well. He had amazing grace. He accepted who he was, but \\the cared more about what he could and should become. He saw \\tthings that could be lost in the glare of the spotlight. And he \\tcould laugh at the absurdity of too much pomp and circumstance. He loved to travel \\tacross this city by subway, bicycle and roller blade. He lived \\tas if he were unrecognizable -- although he was known by \\teveryone he encountered. He always introduced himself, rather \\tthan take anything for granted. He drove his own car and flew \\this own plane, which is how he wanted it. He was the king of his \\tdomain. He thought politics \\tshould be an integral part of our popular culture and that \\tpopular culture should be an integral part of politics. He \\ttransformed that belief into the creation of\\xa0George. John shaped \\tand honed a fresh, often irreverent journal. His new political \\tmagazine attracted a new generation, many of whom had never read \\tabout politics before. John also brought to \\tGeorge a wit that was quick and sure. The premier issue of \\tGeorge caused a stir with a cover photograph of Cindy Crawford \\tdressed as George Washington with a bare belly button. The \"Reliable \\tSource\" in The Washington Post\\xa0 printed a mock cover of George \\tshowing not Cindy Crawford, but me dressed as George Washington, \\twith my belly button exposed. I suggested to John that perhaps I \\tshould have been the model for the first cover of his magazine. \\tWithout missing a beat, John told me that he stood by his \\toriginal editorial decision. John brought this \\tsame playful wit to other aspects of his life. He campaigned for \\tme during my 1994 election and always caused a stir when he \\tarrived in Massachusetts. Before one of his trips to Boston, \\tJohn told the campaign he was bringing along a companion, but \\twould need only one hotel room. Interested, but \\tdiscreet, a senior campaign worker picked John up at the airport \\tand prepared to handle any media barrage that might accompany \\tJohn\\'s arrival with his mystery companion. John landed with the \\tcompanion all right -- an enormous German shepherd dog named Sam \\the had just rescued from the pound. He loved to talk \\tabout the expression on the campaign worker\\'s face and the \\treaction of the clerk at the Charles Hotel when John and Sam \\tchecked in. I think now not only \\tof these wonderful adventures, but of the kind of person John \\twas. He was the son who quietly gave extraordinary time and \\tideas to the Institute of Politics at Harvard that bears his \\tfather\\'s name. He brought to the institute his distinctive \\tinsight that politics could have a broader appeal, that it was \\tnot just about elections, but about the larger forces that shape \\tour whole society. John was also the \\tson who was once protected by his mother. He went on to become \\ther pride -- and then her protector in her final days. He was \\tthe Kennedy who loved us all, but who especially cherished his \\tsister, Caroline, celebrated her brilliance and took strength \\tand joy from their lifelong mutual admiration society. And for a thousand \\tdays, he was a husband who adored the wife who became his \\tperfect soul mate. John\\'s father taught us all to reach for the \\tmoon and the stars. John did that in all he did -- and he found \\this shining star when he married Carolyn Bessette. How often our family \\twill think of the two of them, cuddling affectionately on a \\tboat, surrounded by family -- aunts, uncles, Caroline and Ed and \\ttheir children, Rose, Tatiana, and Jack -- Kennedy cousins, \\tRadziwill cousins, Shriver cousins, Smith cousins, Lawford \\tcousins -- as we sailed Nantucket Sound. Then we would come \\thome -- and before dinner, on the lawn where his father had \\tplayed, John would lead a spirited game of touch football. And \\this beautiful young wife -- the new pride of the Kennedys -- \\twould cheer for John\\'s team and delight her nieces and nephews \\twith her somersaults. We loved Carolyn. \\tShe and her sister, Lauren, were young, extraordinary women of \\thigh accomplishment -- and their own limitless possibilities. We \\tmourn their loss and honor their lives. The Bessette and Freeman \\tfamilies will always be part of ours. John was a serious \\tman who brightened our lives with his smile and his grace. He \\twas a son of privilege who founded a program called Reaching Up \\tto train better caregivers for the mentally disabled. He joined Wall \\tStreet executives on the Robin Hood Foundation to help the \\tcity\\'s impoverished children. And he did it all so quietly, \\twithout ever calling attention to himself. John was one of \\tJackie\\'s two miracles. He was still becoming the person he would \\tbe, and doing it by the beat of his own drummer. He had only \\tjust begun. There was in him a great promise of things to come. The Irish ambassador \\trecited a poem to John\\'s father and mother soon after John was \\tborn. I can hear it again now, at this different and difficult \\tmoment: We wish to \\t\\tthe new childA heart that can be beguiledBy a flowerThat the wind liftsAs it passes.If the storms break for himMay the trees shake for himTheir blossoms down. In the night \\t\\tthat he is troubledMay a friend wake for himSo that his time may be doubled,And at the end of all loving and love,May the Man aboveGive him a crown. We thank the \\tmillions who have rained blossoms down on John\\'s memory. He and \\this bride have gone to be with his mother and father, where \\tthere will never be an end to love. He was lost on that troubled \\tnight -- but we will always wake for him, so that his time, \\twhich was not doubled, but cut in half, will live forever in our \\tmemory, and in our beguiled and broken hearts. We dared to think, \\tin that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to \\tcomb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like \\this father, he had every gift but length of years. We who have loved \\thim from the day he was born, and watched the remarkable man he \\tbecame, now bid him farewell. God bless you, John \\tand Carolyn. We love you and we always will.',\n",
       " 'Thank you,President DeGioia. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. \\r\\n\\t\\tThank you for inviting me toGeorgetown University. I am honored to be \\r\\n\\t\\there. I wanted to meet with you today, as President DeGioia said, to \\r\\n\\t\\tshare with you my thoughts on the relationship between law enforcement and the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunities we serve and protect. Like a lot of things in life, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat relationship is complicated. Relationships often are. Beautiful Healy Hall -- part of, and all around where we sit now -- was \\r\\n\\t\\tnamed after this great university\\'s 29th President,Patrick Francis \\r\\n\\t\\tHealy. Healy was born into slavery in Georgia in 1834. His father was \\r\\n\\t\\tan Irish immigrant plantation owner; his mother, a slave. Under the \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws of that time, Healy and his siblings were considered to be slaves. \\r\\n\\t\\tHealy is believed to be the first African-American to earn a Ph.D., the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst to enter the Jesuit order, the first to be president of \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorgetown University or any predominantly white university. Given Georgetown\\'s remarkable history, and that of President Healy, this \\r\\n\\t\\tstruck me as the appropriate place to talk about the difficult \\r\\n\\t\\trelationship between law enforcement and the communities we are sworn to \\r\\n\\t\\tserve and protect. With thedeath of Michael Brownin Ferguson, thedeath of Eric Garnerin \\r\\n\\t\\tStaten Island, and the ongoing protests throughout the country, and theassassinations of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, we are at \\r\\n\\t\\ta crossroads. As a society, we can choose to live our lives everyday, \\r\\n\\t\\traising our families, going to work, and hoping that someone, somewhere, \\r\\n\\t\\twill do something to ease the tension -- to smooth over the conflict. We \\r\\n\\t\\tcan roll up our car windows, turn up the radio and drive around these \\r\\n\\t\\tproblems, or we can choose instead to have an open and honest discussion about \\r\\n\\t\\twhat our relationship is today -- what it should be, what it could be, \\r\\n\\t\\twhat it needs to be -- if we took more time to better understand one \\r\\n\\t\\tanother. Unfortunately, in places like Ferguson and New York City, and in some \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunities across this nation, there is a disconnect between police \\r\\n\\t\\tagencies and the citizens they server -- predominantly in communities of color. Serious debates are taking place about how law enforcement personnel \\r\\n\\t\\trelate to the communities they serve, about the appropriate use of \\r\\n\\t\\tforce, and about the real and perceived biases, both within and outside of \\r\\n\\t\\tlaw enforcement. These are important debates. Every American should feel \\r\\n\\t\\tfree to express an informed opinion, to protest peacefully, to convey \\r\\n\\t\\tfrustration and even anger in a constructive way. That\\'s what makes this \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocracy great. Those conversations -- as bumpy and uncomfortable as \\r\\n\\t\\tthey can be -- help us understand different perspectives, and better \\r\\n\\t\\tserve our communities. Of course, they are only conversations in the \\r\\n\\t\\ttrue sense of that word if we are willing not only to talk but to \\r\\n\\t\\tlisten, too. I worry that this incredibly important and difficult \\r\\n\\t\\tconversation about race and policing has become focused entirely on the \\r\\n\\t\\tnature and character of law enforcement officers, when it should also be \\r\\n\\t\\tabout something much harder to discuss. Debating the nature of policing \\r\\n\\t\\tis very important, but I worry that it has become an excuse, at times, \\r\\n\\t\\tto avoid doing something harder. Let me start by sharing some of my own hard truths: First, all of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge \\r\\n\\t\\tthat much of our history is not pretty. At many points in American \\r\\n\\t\\thistory, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was \\r\\n\\t\\toften brutally unfair to disfavored groups. It was unfair to the Healy \\r\\n\\t\\tsiblings and to countless others like them. It was unfair to too many \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. I am descended from Irish immigrants. A century ago, the Irish knew well \\r\\n\\t\\thow American society -- and law enforcement -- viewed them: as drunks, \\r\\n\\t\\truffians, and criminals. Law enforcement\\'s biased view of the Irish \\r\\n\\t\\tlives on in the nickname we still use for the vehicles we use to \\r\\n\\t\\ttransport groups of prisoners. It is, after all, the \"paddy wagon.\" The Irish had some tough times, but little compares to the experience on our \\r\\n\\t\\tsoil of black Americans. That experience should be part of every \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican\\'s consciousness, and law enforcement\\'s role in that experience \\r\\n\\t\\t-- including in recent times -- must be remembered. It is our cultural \\r\\n\\t\\tinheritance. There is a reason that I require all new agents and analysts to study \\r\\n\\t\\tthe FBI\\'s interaction with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and to visithis \\r\\n\\t\\tmemorialin Washington as part of their training. And there is a reason \\r\\n\\t\\tI keep on my desk a copy of Attorney General Robert Kennedy\\'s approval \\r\\n\\t\\tof J. Edgar Hoover\\'s request to wiretap Dr. King. It is a single page. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe entire application is five sentences long. It is without fact or \\r\\n\\t\\tsubstance, and is predicated on the naked assertion that there is \\r\\n\\t\\t(quote) \"communist influence in the racial situation.\" The reason I do those \\r\\n\\t\\tthings is to ensure that we remember our mistakes and that we learn from \\r\\n\\t\\tthem. One reason we cannot forget our law enforcement legacy is that the \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople we serve and protect cannot forget it either. So we must talk \\r\\n\\t\\tabout our history. It is a hard truth that lives on. A second hard truth: Much research points to the widespread existence of \\r\\n\\t\\tunconscious bias. Many people in our white-majority culture have \\r\\n\\t\\tunconscious racial biases and react differently to a white face than a \\r\\n\\t\\tblack face. In fact, we all, white and black, carry various biases \\r\\n\\t\\taround with us. I am reminded of the song from the Broadway hit,Avenue \\r\\n\\t\\tQ: \"Everyone\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\ta Little Bit Racist\" -- part of which goes like this: Look around and you will findNo one\\'s really color blind.Maybe it\\'s a factWe all should faceEveryone makes judgmentsBased on race. (You should be grateful I did not try to sing that.) But if we can\\'t help our latent biases, we can help our behavior in \\r\\n\\t\\tresponse to those instinctive reactions, which is why we work to design \\r\\n\\t\\tsystems and processes to overcome that very human part of us all. \\r\\n\\t\\tAlthough the research may be unsettling, it is what we do next that \\r\\n\\t\\tmatters most. But racial bias isn\\'t epidemic in law enforcement any more than it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tepidemic in academia or the arts. In fact, I believe law enforcement \\r\\n\\t\\toverwhelmingly attracts people who want to do good for a living -- \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople who risk their lives because they want to help other people. They \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t sign up to be cops in New York or Chicago or L.A. to help white \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople or black people or Hispanic people or Asian people. They sign up \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause they want to help all people. And they do some of the hardest, \\r\\n\\t\\tmost danger -- dangerous policing to protect communities of color. But that leads me to my third hard truth: Something happens to people in \\r\\n\\t\\tlaw enforcement. Many of us develop different flavors of cynicism that \\r\\n\\t\\twe work hard to resist because they can be lazy mental shortcuts. For \\r\\n\\t\\texample, criminal suspects routinely lie about their guilt and nearly \\r\\n\\t\\teverybody we charge is guilty. That makes it easy for some folks in law \\r\\n\\t\\tenforcement to assume that everybody is lying and that no suspect, \\r\\n\\t\\tregardless of their race, could be innocent. Easy, but wrong. Likewise, police officers on patrol in our nation\\'s cities often work in \\r\\n\\t\\tenvironments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime \\r\\n\\t\\tis committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good \\r\\n\\t\\twill working in that environment. After years of police work, officers \\r\\n\\t\\toften can\\'t help but be influenced by the cynicism they feel. A mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible -- and maybe even rational by \\r\\n\\t\\tsome lights. The two young black men on one side of the street look like \\r\\n\\t\\tso many others that officer has locked up. Two white men on the other \\r\\n\\t\\tside of the street -- even in the same clothes -- do not. The officer \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes not make the same association about the two white guys, whether \\r\\n\\t\\tthat officer is white or black. And that drives different behavior. The \\r\\n\\t\\tofficer turns towards one side of the street and not the other. We need \\r\\n\\t\\tto come to grips with the fact that this behavior complicates the \\r\\n\\t\\trelationship between the police and the communities they serve. So why has that officer -- like his colleagues -- locked up so many \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung men of color? Why does he have that life-shaping experience? Is it \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause he is a racist? Why are so many black men in jail? Is it because \\r\\n\\t\\tcops, prosecutors, judges, and juries are racist? Because they are \\r\\n\\t\\tturning a blind eye to white robbers and drug dealers? The answer is a fourth hard truth: I don\\'t think so. If it were so, that \\r\\n\\t\\twould be easier to address. We would just need to train -- change the way we \\r\\n\\t\\thire, train, and measure law enforcement and that would substantially \\r\\n\\t\\tfix it. We would then go get the white criminals we have been \\r\\n\\t\\tignoring. But the truth is much harder than that. The truth is that what really needs fixing is something only a few, like \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Obama, are willing to speak about, perhaps because it is so \\r\\n\\t\\tdaunting a task. Through the \"My Brother\\'s Keeper\" initiative, the \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident is addressing the disproportionate challenges faced by young \\r\\n\\t\\tmen of color. For instance, data shows that the percentage of young men \\r\\n\\t\\tnot working or not enrolled in school is nearly twice as high for blacks \\r\\n\\t\\tas it is for whites. This initiative, and others like it, is about doing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe hard work to grow drug-resistant and violence-resistant kids, \\r\\n\\t\\tespecially in communities of color, so they never become part of that \\r\\n\\t\\tofficer\\'s life experience. So many young men of color become part of that life -- officer\\'s life experience \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause so many minority families and communities are struggling; so \\r\\n\\t\\tmany boys and young men grow up in environments lacking role models, \\r\\n\\t\\tadequate education, and decent employment -- they lack all sorts of \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities that most of us take for granted. A tragedy of American \\r\\n\\t\\tlife, one that most citizens are able to drive around because it \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\'t touch them, is that young people in \"those neighborhoods\" too \\r\\n\\t\\toften inherit a legacy of crime and prison. And with that inheritance, \\r\\n\\t\\tthey become part of a police officer\\'s life, and shape the way that \\r\\n\\t\\tofficer,\\xa0 whether white or black, sees the world. Changing that \\r\\n\\t\\tlegacy is a challenge so enormous and so complicated that it is, \\r\\n\\t\\tunfortunately, easy -- easier to talk only about the cops. And that\\'s not fair. Let me be transparent about my affection for cops. When you dial 911, \\r\\n\\t\\twhether you are white or black, the cops come, and they come quickly, \\r\\n\\t\\tand they come quickly whether they are white or black. That\\'s what cops \\r\\n\\t\\tdo, in addition to all of the other dangerous and difficult and \\r\\n\\t\\thard and frightening things that they do. They respond to homes in the middle of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe night where a drunken father, wielding a gun, is threatening his \\r\\n\\t\\twife and children. They pound up the back stairs of an apartment \\r\\n\\t\\tbuilding, not knowing whether the guys behind the door they are about to \\r\\n\\t\\tenter are armed, or high, or both. I come from a law enforcement family. My grandfather,William J. Comey, \\r\\n\\t\\twas a police officer. Pop Comey is one of my heroes. I have a picture of \\r\\n\\t\\thim on my wall in my office at the FBI, reminding me of the legacy that \\r\\n\\t\\tI have \\r\\n\\t\\tinherited and that I must honor. He was a child of immigrants. When he was in the sixth grade, his father \\r\\n\\t\\twas killed in an industrial accident in New York. so he had to drop out of school to \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport his mom and younger siblings. He could never afford to return to \\r\\n\\t\\tschool, but when he was old enough, he joined the Yonkers, New York, \\r\\n\\t\\tPolice Department. Over the next 40 years, he rose to lead that department. Pop was the \\r\\n\\t\\ttall, strong, silent type, quiet and dignified, and passionate about the \\r\\n\\t\\trule of law. Back during Prohibition, he heard that bootleggers were \\r\\n\\t\\trunning beer through fire hoses between the Bronx and Yonkers. Now, Pop enjoyed a good beer every now and then, but he ordered his men \\r\\n\\t\\tto cut those hoses with fire axes. And then he needed a protective detail \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause certain people were angry and shocked that someone in law \\r\\n\\t\\tenforcement would do that. But that\\'s what we want as citizens. That is \\r\\n\\t\\twhat we expect. And so I keep a picture of Pop on my wall in my office to \\r\\n\\t\\tremind me of his integrity, and his pride in his -- the integrity of his work. Law enforcement ranks are filled with people like my grandfather. But \\r\\n\\t\\tto be clear, although I am from a law enforcement family, and I have spent \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch of my career in law enforcement, I am not looking to let law \\r\\n\\t\\tenforcement off the hook. Those of us in law enforcement must redouble \\r\\n\\t\\tour efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople we serve and protect -- by trying to know, deep in our gut, what \\r\\n\\t\\tit feels like to be a law-abiding young black man walking down the street \\r\\n\\t\\tand encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man \\r\\n\\t\\tmay see us. We must resist the lazy shortcuts of cynicism and approach \\r\\n\\t\\thim with respect and decency. We must work, in the words of New York City Police CommissionerBill \\r\\n\\t\\tBratton, to really \"see each other.\"1Perhaps the reason we struggle as a \\r\\n\\t\\tnation is because we\\'ve come to see only what we represent at face \\r\\n\\t\\tvalue, instead of who we are. We simply mustseethe people we serve. But the \"seeing\" needs to flow in both directions. Citizens also need to \\r\\n\\t\\treallyseethe men and women of law enforcement. They need to see what \\r\\n\\t\\tpolice see through their windshields and as they walk \\r\\n\\t\\tdown the street. They need toseethe risks and dangers of law enforcement \\r\\n\\t\\tencountered on every typical late-night shift. They need to \\r\\n\\t\\tunderstand the difficult and frightening work that they do to keep us safe. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd they need to give them the respect and the space they need to do their \\r\\n\\t\\tjob well and \\r\\n\\t\\tproperly. If they take the time to do that, what they willseeare officers who \\r\\n\\t\\tare human, who are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right \\r\\n\\t\\treasons, and who are too often operating in communities and facing \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges most of us choose to drive around. One of the hardest things I doas FBI Directoris call the chiefs and \\r\\n\\t\\tsheriffs of departments around the nation when officers have been killed \\r\\n\\t\\tin the line of duty. I call to express my sorrow and to offer the FBI\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\thelp. Officers likeWenjian LiuandRafael Ramos, two ofNYPD\\'s finestwho were gunned down by a madman who thought his ambush would avenge the \\r\\n\\t\\tdeaths of\\r\\n\\t\\tMichael Brown and \\r\\n\\t\\tEric Garner. I make far too many calls. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthere are far too many names of fallen officers on theNational Law \\r\\n\\t\\tEnforcement Officers Memorialand far too many names etched there each \\r\\n\\t\\tyear. Officers Liu and Ramos swore the same oath all in law enforcement do, \\r\\n\\t\\tand they answered the call to serve the people, all the people. Like all \\r\\n\\t\\tgood police officers, they moved toward danger, without regard for the \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics or passions or race of those who needed their help -- knowing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe risks inherent in their work. They were minority police officers, \\r\\n\\t\\tkilled while standing watch in a minority neighborhood -- \\r\\n\\t\\tBedford-Stuyvesant, in Brooklyn -- a neighborhood that they and their fellow officers rescued \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the grip of violent crime. For -- A couple of decades ago,Bed-Stuywas shorthand for a kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tchaos and disorder in which good people had no freedom to walk or shop \\r\\n\\t\\tor play or \\r\\n\\t\\tjust sit on the front steps and talk. It was too dangerous. But no more, thanks to the work of those who chose lives of service and \\r\\n\\t\\tdanger to help others. But despite that sacrifice, that selfless service of these two officers, and countless \\r\\n\\t\\tothers like them around the country, in some American communities, \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople view the police not as allies but as antagonists, and think of \\r\\n\\t\\tthem as someone not to be treated with gratitude and respect but with \\r\\n\\t\\tsomeone worthy of suspicion and distrust.\\r\\n\\t\\tWe simply must find a way to see each other more clearly. And part of \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has to involve collecting and sharing better information about \\r\\n\\t\\tviolent encounters between police and citizens. Not long afterriots broke out in Fergusonlate last summer, I asked my \\r\\n\\t\\tstaff to tell me how many people shot by police were African-American in \\r\\n\\t\\tthis country. I wanted to see trends. I wanted to see information. They \\r\\n\\t\\tcouldn\\'t give it to me, and it wasn\\'t their fault. Demographic data \\r\\n\\t\\tregarding officer-involved shootings is not consistently reported to us \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough ourUniform Crime Reporting Program. Because reporting is \\r\\n\\t\\tvoluntary, our data is incomplete and therefore, in aggregate, \\r\\n\\t\\tunreliable. I recently listened to a thoughtful big city [police] chief express his \\r\\n\\t\\tfrustration with that lack of reliable data. He said he didn\\'t know \\r\\n\\t\\twhether the Ferguson police shot one person a week, one a year, or one a \\r\\n\\t\\tcentury, and that in the absence of good data (quote), \"all we get are \\r\\n\\t\\tideological thunderbolts, when what we need are ideological agnostics \\r\\n\\t\\twho use information to try to solve problems.\" He\\'s right. The first step to understanding what is really going on in our \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunities and in our country is to gather more and better data related \\r\\n\\t\\tto those we arrest, those we confront for breaking the law and \\r\\n\\t\\tjeopardizing public safety, and those who confront us. Now \"data\" seems a \\r\\n\\t\\tdry and boring word, but without it we cannot understand our world and \\r\\n\\t\\tmake it better. How can we address concerns about \"use of force?\" How can we address \\r\\n\\t\\tconcerns about officer-involved shootings if we do not have a reliable \\r\\n\\t\\tgrasp on the demographic[s] and circumstances of those incidents? We \\r\\n\\t\\tsimply must improve the way we collect and analyze data to see the true \\r\\n\\t\\tnature of what\\'s happening in our communities. The FBI tracks and publishes the number of justifiable homicides \\r\\n\\t\\treported by police departments. But, again, reporting by police \\r\\n\\t\\tdepartments is voluntary and not all departments participate. That means \\r\\n\\t\\twe cannot fully track the incidents in which force is used by \\r\\n\\t\\tpolice, or against police, including non-fatal encounters, which are not \\r\\n\\t\\treported at all. Without complete and accurate data, we are left with ideological \\r\\n\\t\\tthunderbolts. And that helps spark unrest and distrust and does not \\r\\n\\t\\thelp us get better. Because we must get better, I intend for the FBI to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe the leader in urging departments around this country to give us the \\r\\n\\t\\tfacts we need for informed discussion -- the facts all of us need, and to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp us make sound policy and sound decisions with that information. America isn\\'t easy. America takes work. Today, February 12th, is Abraham \\r\\n\\t\\tLincoln\\'s birthday. Hespoke at Gettysburgabout a \"new birth of \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom\" because we spent the first four score and seven years of our \\r\\n\\t\\thistory with fellow Americans held as slaves -- President Healy, his \\r\\n\\t\\tsiblings, and his mother among them. As a nation, we have spent the 150 years since \\r\\n\\t\\tLincoln spoke making great progress, but along the way treating a whole \\r\\n\\t\\tlot of people of color poorly. And law enforcement was often part of \\r\\n\\t\\tthat poor treatment. That\\'s our inheritance as law enforcement and it is \\r\\n\\t\\tnot all in the distant past. We must account for that inheritance. And we, especially those of us \\r\\n\\t\\twho enjoy the privilege that comes with being the majority, must \\r\\n\\t\\tconfront the biases that are inescapable parts of the human condition. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe must speak the truth about our shortcomings as law enforcement and \\r\\n\\t\\tfight to get better. But as a country, we must also speak the truth to \\r\\n\\t\\tourselves. Law enforcement is not the root cause of the problems in our \\r\\n\\t\\thardest hit neighborhoods. Police officers, people of enormous courage \\r\\n\\t\\tand integrity in the overwhelming main, are in those neighborhoods, risking their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives, to protect folks from offenders who are a product of problems \\r\\n\\t\\tthat will not be solved by body cameras. We simply must speak to each other honestly about all these hard truths. In the words of Dr. King, \"We must [all] learn to live together as brothers \\r\\n\\t\\t-- or \\r\\n\\t\\twe will all perish together as fools.\" We all have hard work to do, challenging work, and it will \\r\\n\\t\\ttake time. We all need to talk and we all need to listen, not just about \\r\\n\\t\\teasy things, but about hard things, too. Relationships are hard. \\r\\n\\t\\tRelationships require work. So let\\'s begin that work. It is time to \\r\\n\\t\\tstart seeing one another for who and what we really are. Peace, \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity, and understanding are worth that effort. Thank you for \\r\\n\\t\\tlistening to me today.',\n",

The sky was a starry blue, a \\r\\n\\t\\tglorious backdrop for possibly the most important moment in history. \\r\\n\\t\\tYes --Game 6 of the Boston Red Sox-New York Mets World Series. Bottom of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe tenth with two out and Ray Knight on second. Mookie Wilson stood on \\r\\n\\t\\thome plate facing a steely-faced Bob Stanley. Stanley pitched a frozen \\r\\n\\t\\trough over home plate and Mookie tapped it right down the first \\r\\n\\t\\tbaseline. Inside his head, the first baseman heard the call of his name \\r\\n\\t\\tlike the voice of God: Bill Buckner -- ner -- ner\\x85. It was only Bill and the \\r\\n\\t\\tball and his faceoff with destiny. Bill pulled out his glove and watched \\r\\n\\t\\tin slow motion as that ball rolled right between his legs. And that was \\r\\n\\t\\tit. The Red Sox lost and Buckner was pegged as the World Series goat. \\r\\n\\t\\tBoston hated him for the loss, and no matter how good his batting \\r\\n\\t\\taverage, no matter what previous mistakes had been made in the game, \\r\\n\\t\\tforgiveness for Bill Buckner was completely out of the question. This \\r\\n\\t\\tattitude is not limited to the baseball stadium. In fact, it\\x92s becoming \\r\\n\\t\\tmore of the national pastime than baseball itself. Author Greg \\r\\n\\t\\tEasterbrook states inThe Progress Paradoxthat we, now more than ever, \\r\\n\\t\\tlive in an age in which the collecting of grievances and the holding of \\r\\n\\t\\tgrudges is elaborately encouraged, where forgiveness is not just \\r\\n\\t\\tignored, it\\'s looked down upon. That\\'s my concern. As a society, too \\r\\n\\t\\toften we choose to live in what I call a state of unforgiveness. We \\r\\n\\t\\trepeatedly refuse to forgive others for errors committed against us, no \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter how big or small. Not only are we hurting those we don\\'t forgive, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut we\\'re hurting ourselves as well. So, today I\\'ll show you the play by \\r\\n\\t\\tplay, as we look at how we wrongly respond to these errors, by first \\r\\n\\t\\tholding grudges, and second, getting even. After the 2004 Red Sox World \\r\\n\\t\\tSeries win, many people decided it was time to forgive Billy\\'s mistake. \\r\\n\\t\\tWait a second. Didn\\'t that happen 18 years ago? Clearly, they had some \\r\\n\\t\\ttrouble letting go of old grudges; and they\\'re not alone. Chances are \\r\\n\\t\\tyou could think of at least one person who you really haven\\'t forgiven \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tlike the coworker who constantly took credit for your incredible work, \\r\\n\\t\\tor the competitor who ignored you in a round, or the supposed best \\r\\n\\t\\tfriend\\xa0 -- let\\'s call her \"Alexis\" -- who, in tenth grade, tried to steal your \\r\\n\\t\\tboyfriend while supposedly talking to him on your behalf -- let\\'s call him \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Steve.\" And the names have not been changed here, people, because no one \\r\\n\\t\\tis innocent. But, I forgave her. Besides, \\r\\n\\t\\tI won. Studies conducted by the Stanford University Forgiveness Project \\r\\n\\t\\tfound that individuals who harbor grudges not only damage their \\r\\n\\t\\tinterpersonal relationships, but they also damage themselves. They are \\r\\n\\t\\tmore likely to experience high levels of stress, high blood pressure, \\r\\n\\t\\tdepression, a suppressed immune system, stress related diseases like \\r\\n\\t\\tfibromyalgia and even heart disease. Or, basically, all of the side \\r\\n\\t\\teffects of Viagra. But, seriously, that\\'s because when we hold feelings \\r\\n\\t\\tof anger and hatred bottled up inside, they often manifest themselves \\r\\n\\t\\tinto physical symptoms. Think of it this way: when we harden our hearts \\r\\n\\t\\ttoward others, we literally harden our hearts. So ultimately, holding \\r\\n\\t\\tgrudges is the game with no winners. Now, the technical \\r\\n\\t\\tdefinition of an error in baseball is \"a mistake made by a player that \\r\\n\\t\\tgives the opposing team an extra advantage.\" But, in the game of getting \\r\\n\\t\\teven, a mistake made by someone ignites revenge, and rarely does any \\r\\n\\t\\tplayer have the advantage. Are you harboring resentment towards someone? \\r\\n\\t\\tWell, you could go toRevengeLady.com, a helpful website that offers \\r\\n\\t\\thints on taking revenge. Vengeance is mine, saith the Revenge Lady. One \\r\\n\\t\\tof my particular favorites on this website is a story about a spiteful \\r\\n\\t\\tsecretary who wants to get even with her boss after an argument. Now, \\r\\n\\t\\tthey say that revenge is the dish best served cold. So, she injected \\r\\n\\t\\tmilk into his desk chair and spread ground beef under his carpet. Now, to our secretary, this may have seemed like a home run, but after \\r\\n\\t\\ther boss found out it was her dirty deed, she found herself, not an \\r\\n\\t\\tall-star, but unemployed. Now while we may laugh at \\r\\n\\t\\tthese more ridiculous tales of revenge gone awry, we need to realize \\r\\n\\t\\tthat not all tales of revenge are this light-hearted. Take, for example, a \\r\\n\\t\\tstory reported inTime Magazineabout Thomas Jefferson High School in \\r\\n\\t\\tBrooklyn, New York, where students Tyrone Sinclair and Ian Moore, ages16 \\r\\n\\t\\tand 17, were both murdered by fellow student Kaleen Sumter, age 15, in \\r\\n\\t\\tan act of revenge. Sumter had gotten in some fist fights with the boys \\r\\n\\t\\tand one day decided to get even by bringing a gun to school and shooting \\r\\n\\t\\tthem both point blank in the hallway. In a four year span at Thomas \\r\\n\\t\\tJefferson High, 70 students died, and the study prepared for the state \\r\\n\\t\\tof New York found that 50% of all 1,900 students had some kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tpuncture wound on their body at any given time. The school has a \\r\\n\\t\\tgrieving room where students can seek solace, along with an ongoing \\r\\n\\t\\tburial fund to help families finance funerals. Clearly, for these \\r\\n\\t\\tstudents, there is no room for human error because revenge has become a \\r\\n\\t\\tway of life. Dr. Robert Enright, the unquestioned pioneer in the \\r\\n\\t\\tscientific study of forgiveness, sees a direct correlation between our \\r\\n\\t\\tability to forgive and the prevalence of violence in schools, the \\r\\n\\t\\tdisintegration of marriage, and the breakdown of family. Maybe that\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\twhy studies now show that more than 135,000 students bring guns to \\r\\n\\t\\tschool each day, or the divorce rate is now reaching 60%, and why every \\r\\n\\t\\t26 seconds, a teenager runs away from home. I\\'ll admit that I\\'m no \\r\\n\\t\\tstranger to bitterness. Very recently, a close friend of mine was hit \\r\\n\\t\\tand killed in a car accident where he was hit head-on by two different \\r\\n\\t\\tvehicles. When I learned of his death, not only was I filled with a deep \\r\\n\\t\\tsorrow, but a burning rage for these two drivers. Why had they been \\r\\n\\t\\tdriving so fast? Why weren\\'t they looking where they were going? Out of \\r\\n\\t\\tall the cars on the road, why did they have to hit his? On the day of \\r\\n\\t\\this funeral, I was still so angry with these men who had taken my friend \\r\\n\\t\\taway from me. His mother got up to deliver her memorial. She said that \\r\\n\\t\\tshe missed Chris. She would always miss Chris -- but that she did not \\r\\n\\t\\tblame the two drivers and urged them not to live in guilt over the \\r\\n\\t\\taccident. She said: I can either sow seeds of bitterness and reap \\r\\n\\t\\tunhappiness, or sow seeds of forgiveness and reap joy. I could not \\r\\n\\t\\tchoose when Chris would leave this earth, but I can choose to live my \\r\\n\\t\\tlife in peace and in grace. Surely if a grieving mother can find room in \\r\\n\\t\\ther heart for forgiveness, then the rest of us can at least try. So, how can we be more like \\r\\n\\t\\tChris\\'s mom and make the choice to forgive those who have hurt us? Well, \\r\\n\\t\\tDr. [Fred] Luskin, author of the bookForgive for Good, offers us these \\r\\n\\t\\tbasic steps. First, we need to realize that forgiveness is not some \\r\\n\\t\\tcatch-all net that lets anything slide. Forgiveness is not the absence \\r\\n\\t\\tof justice, or the condoning of bad behaviors. If someone breaks your \\r\\n\\t\\twindow with a baseball, you can forgive them. They should still pay for \\r\\n\\t\\tit. If somebody breaks your heart, they need to know the consequences of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir actions. And if your little sister calls you evil, tall girl, she \\r\\n\\t\\tshould know that\\'s not an appropriate way to address you. And if you go \\r\\n\\t\\tahead and eat half of her Halloween candy because of it, well, you \\r\\n\\t\\tshould know better. Second, we need to realize \\r\\n\\t\\tthat forgiveness is not absolving someone their sin, but rather \\r\\n\\t\\treleasing hurt that was dealt us and moving on with life. Finally, we \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to forgive the person or persons who hurt us, whether they asked \\r\\n\\t\\tfor forgiveness or not. Ultimately, the choice is ours. After all, \\r\\n\\t\\tchange is possible. Think of old Billy himself, \\r\\n\\t\\twho, when asked how he felt about the 2004 Red Sox World Series win, \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid, \"This is their championship. This is what they did, and I\\'m happy \\r\\n\\t\\tfor them. Besides, they beat the Yankees along the way. I hate the \\r\\n\\t\\tYankees.\" So, if the Red Sox fans and \\r\\n\\t\\tBill Buckner can do it, then maybe, even when life throws us a curve, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s time for us to step up to the plate -- and play ball.',\n",
       " 'Good morning. I\\x92d like to thank RSA for \\r\\n\\t\\tbringing me back here today. I also want to acknowledge my wife Linda \\r\\n\\t\\tthis Valentines Day. Happy Valentines Day, honey. We have five teenagers \\r\\n\\t\\tat home, so when it comes to homeland security, issues I have a lot of \\r\\n\\t\\tpersonal experience on the home front, we call it domestic terrorism at \\r\\n\\t\\tmy house. Before we begin, I want to say it\\x92s an \\r\\n\\t\\thonor for me to address some of the brightest tech leaders in the world. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou are the mode of power of the modern economy. You are advancing human \\r\\n\\t\\tprosperity. And you\\x92re on the front lines of protecting our personal \\r\\n\\t\\tprivacy and digital security. This morning some of you are joining us \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom overseas. And for many others you began your journey to America \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago. I\\x92m proud that our nation is a beacon of hope to people in \\r\\n\\t\\tall corners of the globe who seek to create, collaborate, and innovate. \\r\\n\\t\\t(Thank you.) But in light of recent events in \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington I know there\\x92s deep concern in this room about whether U.S. \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicies will continue to welcome that international talent. So let me \\r\\n\\t\\tsay this \\x96 and we should never forget: This is a country built by \\r\\n\\t\\timmigrants. This is a nation where the oppressed have long sought \\r\\n\\t\\trefuge. And our country is a magnet for creators and entrepreneurs who \\r\\n\\t\\tare willing to take risks and pursue their dreams. The United States \\r\\n\\t\\tmust maintain that tradition not only for our country\\x92s credibility but \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the survival of liberty itself. That is why I will fight to ensure \\r\\n\\t\\tthat America continues to [extend] an open hand to peaceful, \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom-loving people regardless of where they were born, regardless of \\r\\n\\t\\thow they worship, and regardless of the color of their skin \\x96 because \\r\\n\\t\\tthat is who we are. And that is how we will attract the world\\x92s best \\r\\n\\t\\tthinkers to build a stronger country and a more vibrant global economy. Today I want to you about the war in \\r\\n\\t\\tcyberspace, why I believe we are falling behind, and what we can do to \\r\\n\\t\\tstrike back. I\\x92m going to be brutally honest: We are in the fight of our \\r\\n\\t\\tdigital lives, and we are not winning. As a chairman of the Homeland Security \\r\\n\\t\\tCommittee in the House, I get briefed on these threats every week. It\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tclear to me that our adversaries are turning digital breakthroughs into \\r\\n\\t\\tdigital bombs. And from Russian and Chinese hacking to [inaudible at: \\r\\n\\t\\t3:08] headaches, our cyber rivals are overtaking our defenses. \\r\\n\\t\\tNation-states are using cyber tools to steal our country\\x92s secrets, and \\r\\n\\t\\tto copy our intellectual property. Faceless hackers are snatching our \\r\\n\\t\\tcyber data and locking down access to our healthcare information. And \\r\\n\\t\\tterrorists are abusing encryption and social media to crowdsource the \\r\\n\\t\\tmurder of innocent people. Web-based warfare is becoming incredibly \\r\\n\\t\\tpersonal. The combatants are everywhere. And the phones in your pockets \\r\\n\\t\\tare the battlespace. I\\x92d like to ask first for you to raise \\r\\n\\t\\tyour hand if you\\x92ve ever had an online account hacked. Now raise it if \\r\\n\\t\\tyou\\x92ve been told by a retailer or any online service that your \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation may have been compromised. And I\\x92m going to raise mine as \\r\\n\\t\\twell. (Or compromised by a teenager.) Finally, raise your hand if you\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tworried that your accounts and devices could be compromised in the \\r\\n\\t\\tfuture. I would think that\\x92s everybody in this room. And you\\x92re a room of top \\r\\n\\t\\tcybersecurity experts. If you\\x92re concerned about getting hacked, then \\r\\n\\t\\tordinary people should be especially worried.  Former NSA Director Keith Alexander \\r\\n\\t\\tmade a powerful point: The magnitude of cyber espionage and theft we\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tseeing today has led to \\x93the greatest transfer of wealth\\x94 in human \\r\\n\\t\\thistory.1The crisis extends from kitchen tables to corporate boardrooms. In Congress, I oversaw many of our \\r\\n\\t\\tnation\\x92s cybersecurity efforts. And I\\x92ve been the victim of cyber theft. \\r\\n\\t\\tChinese hackers stole 20 million security clearances -- including my own \\r\\n\\t\\t-- in a 2015 attack on the U.S. Government\\x92s Office of Personnel \\r\\n\\t\\tManagement. But the threat is worse than just \\r\\n\\t\\tespionage. Our democracy itself is at risk. Last year, there is no doubt \\r\\n\\t\\tin my mind that the Russian government tried to undermine and influence \\r\\n\\t\\tour elections. They broke into political institutions, invaded the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivacy of private citizens, spread false propaganda, and created \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscord in the lead up to an historic vote. I was briefed on the \\r\\n\\t\\tsituation starting in the springtime, and frankly, it didn\\x92t matter to \\r\\n\\t\\tme whether it was Democrats or Republicans being targeted. These were \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans first, in the crosshairs of the Kremlin. And to me, that was \\r\\n\\t\\tunacceptable. I pushed both the Obama Administration and \\r\\n\\t\\tthen candidate Trump to take public and forceful stands on the issue. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut I was disappointed in their response. The crisis was the biggest \\r\\n\\t\\twakeup call yet that cyber intrusions have the potential to jeopardize \\r\\n\\t\\tthe very fabric of our Republic. So why aren\\x92t we winning? How can cyber \\r\\n\\t\\tcriminals conduct virtual robberies right under our noses? Let me \\r\\n\\t\\tsuggest five reasons. First, there\\x92s the issue of volume. I\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid before that the digital frontier is a lot like the wild west. There \\r\\n\\t\\tare more cyber outlaws than cyber sheriffs to round them up. A lot of \\r\\n\\t\\thackers out there should be behind bars. But law enforcement agencies at \\r\\n\\t\\tall levels are struggling to keep up with the volume and complexity of \\r\\n\\t\\tnetwork intrusions. Also, our laws have not kept up with this new \\r\\n\\t\\tdigital age. Second, the high speed of high tech gives \\r\\n\\t\\tcybercriminals an advantage. History shows us that offensive weapons \\r\\n\\t\\talways outpace our defenses.\\xa0 We faced this challenge with every man-made \\r\\n\\t\\tweapon since the Stone Age. The spear led to the shield, the bullet to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe bulletproof vest, and so on. Yet we\\'ve never seen a weapon used \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst us so regularly, so aggressively, and a weapon that can adapt while we are \\r\\n\\t\\ttrying to defend against it. And it\\x92s expensive to keep up with it. Today, in \\r\\n\\t\\tsome cases, the United States Government is fighting 21st century threats with \\r\\n\\t\\t20th century technology and a 19th century bureaucracy. Third, we have serious \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation-sharing challenges. I compare this to the period before \\r\\n\\t\\t9/11. We all had the information we needed to keep terrorists from \\r\\n\\t\\tattacking on the fateful day. But we did not connect the dots. The walls \\r\\n\\t\\twere up, and we didn\\x92t share the information. We are \\r\\n\\t\\tin the same place with cyber. Between your companies, government \\r\\n\\t\\tagencies, and U.S. allies, we have the threat data to stop many of these \\r\\n\\t\\tintrusions. Yet the sharing is still far too weak. As a result, the vast majority of cyber \\r\\n\\t\\tattacks go unreported, leaving others vulnerable to the same intrusions. Fourth, deterrence is difficult. I know as \\r\\n\\t\\ta former federal prosecutor and as a father of five teenagers that if there are no consequences for bad \\r\\n\\t\\tbehavior, that bad behavior will continue. In the cyber realm, we have \\r\\n\\t\\tto show that there will be consequences, and that intruders will be \\r\\n\\t\\tbrought to justice. Unfortunately, we still do not have clear \\r\\n\\t\\tproportionate response policies for striking back against nation \\r\\n\\t\\tstates, cyber criminals, and others who invade our systems. And we \\r\\n\\t\\tcertainly don\\x92t have the manpower, appropriate legal structures, and \\r\\n\\t\\tglobal cooperation to take down suspects as fast as we need to. Fifth, we face a real paradox between \\r\\n\\t\\tnational security and digital security. Nowhere is this more obvious \\r\\n\\t\\tthan with the terror threat. Gone are the days of Osama bin Laden, when extremists \\r\\n\\t\\tplotted using caves and couriers. Now we have a new generation of \\r\\n\\t\\tterrorists who are recruiting over the internet, and using \\x93virtual safe \\r\\n\\t\\thavens\\x94 to escape detection and force their propaganda on a global \\r\\n\\t\\tInternet scale. And partly as a result, we are seeing an unprecedented \\r\\n\\t\\tspike in terror plotting against the West. We had the brutal attacks in Paris and Brussels \\r\\n\\t\\tas tragic examples and reminders of how terrorists stay under-the-radar by using \\r\\n\\t\\tend-to-end encryption on their phones to cover their tracks. At the same time, we must resist the \\r\\n\\t\\ttemptation to go after encryption with simple knee-jerk responses. I \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve that creating backdoors into secure \\r\\n\\t\\tplatforms would be a huge mistake. It\\xa0 would put our personal data at risk and leave our \\r\\n\\t\\tcompanies vulnerable to intrusion. Instead, we need to find a way to \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep our country safe, while also keeping our data safe and secure. But \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'re still not there yet. So what does it take to prevail against \\r\\n\\t\\tour cyber -- cyber adversaries? It starts with the right mindset. In 1940, \\r\\n\\t\\tBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill responded to the Nazi invasion \\r\\n\\t\\tof Europe witha rousing speech in the House of Commons. He vowed that \\r\\n\\t\\tthe British would: ...fight on the seas and oceans\\x85fight on the \\r\\n\\t\\tbeaches\\x85fight on the landing grounds\\x85fight in the fields and in the \\r\\n\\t\\tstreets\\x85fight in the hills\\x85[and] never surrender. Now, I don\\x92t think we need a bunker \\r\\n\\t\\tmentality, you know, on this. But we need to acknowledge that we are under siege \\r\\n\\t\\tin the cyber space, the cyber battlefield, and respond with urgency and \\r\\n\\t\\tresolve. First, we must redouble our efforts to \\r\\n\\t\\tdefend private sector networks and the public. When I say \\x93we,\\x94 I\\x92m not \\r\\n\\t\\ttalking about just the government.  In fact, President Reagan once said the \\r\\n\\t\\tmost terrifying words in the English language were: \\x93I\\x92m from the \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment and I\\x92m here to help\" you. It still holds true today. Today it might be: \\x93I\\x92m from the \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment and I can help you secure your iPhone.\\x94 But federal agencies \\r\\n\\t\\tare not necessarily the answer when it comes to cybersecurity. I believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the \\r\\n\\t\\tanswer is right here in this room. It\\x92s the bleeding-edge work being \\r\\n\\t\\tdone in the private sector. And we need your innovation -- we need your \\r\\n\\t\\tinitiative, to stay a step ahead of cyber criminals. Government does play a role, a critical \\r\\n\\t\\trole in coordination. In the wake of [the] Snowden leaks, it is  \\r\\n\\t\\timportant, now more than ever, that we reassure the public that federal \\r\\n\\t\\tcybersecurity here at home is being led by a civilian department -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilian department, not by the \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary and not by intelligence agencies. Just as we do not allow \\r\\n\\t\\tsoldiers to protect our city streets -- we allow the police -- we should not have organizations \\r\\n\\t\\tlike the military patrolling our networks. Cyber is a team sport. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe need strong offense and strong defense. So I\\'m pushing to make the \\r\\n\\t\\tlanes of responsibility more clear. I propose the creation of a stronger, \\r\\n\\t\\tconsolidated cybersecurity agency at the \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment of Homeland Security, building on important laws we have \\r\\n\\t\\tpassed in recent years. This is an important step in standing up to cyber \\r\\n\\t\\tattackers. Our next priority should be fixing the \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation sharing weaknesses I outlined earlier. In 2015, Congress passed \\r\\n\\t\\tmy bill,The Cybersecurity Act, a landmark bill to increase information \\r\\n\\t\\tsharing about cyber threats. The law\\x92s liability protections and privacy \\r\\n\\t\\tsafeguards make it easier for companies to stop attacks, and if they \\r\\n\\t\\tchose, to share it with the federal government. But more companies need to \\r\\n\\t\\tstep up to the plate and start sharing with each -- each other. Once \\r\\n\\t\\tagain, that is a goal -- we are counting on you to help us achieve. Next, we need a talented cyber workforce \\r\\n\\t\\ton the frontlines. We are losing \\r\\n\\t\\ttop cyber talent because morale is bad on the inside as -- and money is \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter on the outside. I\\x92m trying to change that. I\\'ve worked with my \\r\\n\\t\\tcolleagues in Congress to pass legislation to expedite hiring authority \\r\\n\\t\\tat DHS for new recruits, but the Department needs to act more quickly to \\r\\n\\t\\tuse this authority. We also need bipartisan legislation -- and we passed \\r\\n\\t\\tit -- creating a \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93scholarships for service\\x94 program to help students pay for college if \\r\\n\\t\\tthey commit to working on cybersecurity at the Federal, State, or local \\r\\n\\t\\tlevel. Thousands of students have now gone through this program, allowing \\r\\n\\t\\tus not only to recruit them -- and recruit top people -- but also to retain them. Many of your organizations face the same \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges. And you want the flexibility to bring in specialists from \\r\\n\\t\\taround the world. I believe America\\x92s doors must stay open to \\r\\n\\t\\thigh-skilled workers who will contribute to our society and join us in \\r\\n\\t\\tbuilding an innovation economy. And that is why I\\x92m supporting efforts in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Congress to streamline ourH-1B visaprocess to make sure tech companies \\r\\n\\t\\tcan get the right people, from the right places, at the right time. And then there is a \\x93going dark\\x94 challenge. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere\\'s no easy answer to this one. As I said before, we cannot undermine \\r\\n\\t\\tencryption -- andwe heard from talented encryption experts in the \\r\\n\\t\\tprevious panel. It\\'s bedrock of internet security. But at the same \\r\\n\\t\\ttime, we cannot -- can\\'t allow groups like ISIS to \\r\\n\\t\\tremote-control terrorist attacks using the darkness of the web. So this \\r\\n\\t\\tyear I -- I will work again with Senator Mark Warner to call for a \\r\\n\\t\\tcommission of the nation\\x92s top experts -- from academia, privacy, tech, \\r\\n\\t\\tand \\r\\n\\t\\tlaw enforcement, and beyond -- to find real solutions that balance \\r\\n\\t\\tdigital security with national security. And I hope many of you will support \\r\\n\\t\\tthisDigital Security Commission. The eyes of the world are upon \\r\\n\\t\\tus, and I believe America should lead the way on this very important \\r\\n\\t\\tissue. Second, to prevail against online \\r\\n\\t\\tadversaries we must defend our government institutions, our critical \\r\\n\\t\\tinfrastructures, and our democracy -- and we must respond to attacks \\r\\n\\t\\tdecisively. As far as federal networks are concerned, DHS is responsible \\r\\n\\t\\tfor securing the so-called \\x93dot gov\\x94 domain. At the end of last year, the Department announced the \\x93Einstein 3A\\x94 \\r\\n\\t\\tto advance intrusion detection. It was providing coverage to a \\r\\n\\t\\ttotal of 93 percent of U.S. civilian agencies. However, we will never be \\r\\n\\t\\table to build virtual walls high enough to completely stop hackers from \\r\\n\\t\\tgetting inside the digital space. So, once again: We need \\r\\n\\t\\tindustry to help us. In Congress, I\\'ll be working on bills to \\r\\n\\t\\tbreak down bureaucratic barriers so that we can collaborate more closely with \\r\\n\\t\\tyour companies to secure federal networks. We also \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that our adversaries are targeting our infrastructure, 85 \\r\\n\\t\\tpercent of which is in the hands of the private sector. They are \\r\\n\\t\\tdeploying cyber implants that could be used to threaten us. A major cyber attack on gas pipelines or the power grid, for \\r\\n\\t\\tinstance, could damage the economy and weaken our ability to defend the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States.\\xa0I just met withAdmiral Mike Rogersfor breakfast, the \\r\\n\\t\\thead of the NSA.\\xa0 Andhe warned \\r\\n\\t\\tCongressthat the -- that the bad guys are leaving \\x93cyber fingerprints\\x94 on \\r\\n\\t\\tour critical \\r\\n\\t\\tinfrastructure. They are sending a message: \\x93Watch what you say and do, \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica, because we can hit you from within.\\x94 It\\'s only a matter of time before such an \\r\\n\\t\\tattack happens, which is why critical infrastructure should be built \\r\\n\\t\\twith cybersecurity in mind. Unfortunately, too often companies are \\r\\n\\t\\tfocused on putting up chain-link fences around their headquarters rather \\r\\n\\t\\tthan putting digital fences around their networks. I plan to work with \\r\\n\\t\\tthe new Administration to address the critical infrastructure \\r\\n\\t\\tvulnerabilities more seriously, and I applaud them for undertaking a \\r\\n\\t\\tmajor review of these threats. More broadly, I\\'ve been urging the \\r\\n\\t\\tAdministration to develop a new national cybersecurity strategy as soon \\r\\n\\t\\tas possible. We are feeling tectonic shifts on the \\r\\n\\t\\tvirtual ground beneath us. And our current cyber plans just won\\x92t cut it. The \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States Government needs better response options. It needs to be \\r\\n\\t\\tconducting regular \\x93cyber exercises\\x94 to make sure we\\x92re prepared -- \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding with foreign partners. Additionally, our ability to win the war \\r\\n\\t\\tin cyberspace depends on our ability to deliver consequences by striking \\r\\n\\t\\tback when appropriate. This will require strong leadership from the top, a \\r\\n\\t\\twillingness to track down rogue hackers, and a determination to hold \\r\\n\\t\\thostile countries accountable for bad behavior. We cannot allow, \\r\\n\\t\\tanymore, foreign \\r\\n\\t\\tadversaries to use cyber intrusions to meddle into our domestic affairs, \\r\\n\\t\\tand especially into our democratic process. This is a redline we should not allow \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone to cross. And our strategy should go beyond just \\x93returning fire\\x94 \\r\\n\\t\\t[online]. It should include the threat of sanctions and other real-world \\r\\n\\t\\tpenalties. Russia is the perfect example. We must \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to call out Moscow for election interference. And if we don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\thold the line on sanctions and deliver meaningful consequences, I am \\r\\n\\t\\tcertain that they \\r\\n\\t\\twill do it again. We\\x92ve got to say \\r\\n\\t\\tenough is enough. Finally, America should be engaging with \\r\\n\\t\\tour overseas partners to win the war in cyberspace -- our NATO allies. \\r\\n\\t\\tOur nations have different \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws and privacy expectations but we\\x92ve got to figure out how to \\r\\n\\t\\trespect those differences while working together quickly -- because \\r\\n\\t\\tthe attackers won\\x92t give us the benefit of time. We must develop clear \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93rules of the road,\\x94 especially when it comes to cyber warfare. In times \\r\\n\\t\\tof crisis, uncertainty and lack of coordination can cause situations to \\r\\n\\t\\tspiral out of control. So we should confer with our partners on major \\r\\n\\t\\tincidents, work together to build mutual defenses, and put the \\r\\n\\t\\tinfrastructures in place for joint action. Lastly, we should make sure we are \\r\\n\\t\\tprepared for what lies ahead. For instance, we need to be ready for the \\r\\n\\t\\tera of quantum computing. The \\x93digital atomic \\r\\n\\t\\tbomb\\x94 is on the not-too-distant horizon. And the first hostile country \\r\\n\\t\\tto gain such capability will pose a serious threat to the rest of the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. \\xa0The United States should lead a coalition of like-minded nations \\r\\n\\t\\tto prepare for the quantum future and ensure we have the right cyber \\r\\n\\t\\tdefenses in place when it comes. Looking back on 2016, it was a watershed year in \\r\\n\\t\\tcyberspace -- and for a lot of the wrong reasons. But I think it made us all more realistic about the \\r\\n\\t\\tdanger we face and more clear-eyed about what needs to be done. And while the cyber landscape is bleak, we \\r\\n\\t\\tcannot let the threat of the unknown and unseen outweigh what we \\r\\n\\t\\talready do know and already can see: that we have the world\\x92s greatest \\r\\n\\t\\tminds working to defend our networks. And to those of you who make \\r\\n\\t\\tcybersecurity your day job, I want to thank you for what you\\x92ve done, for what \\r\\n\\t\\tyou are doing, and what you will do to defend us into the future. Thank you so much for having me. 1Address to the American \\r\\n\\t\\tEnterprise Institute, 9 July 2012.',\n",
       " \" It is wonderful \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing back here at Georgetown in this magnificent Gaston Hall, and to \\r\\n\\t\\tgive you something to do during exam week. It\\x92s one of those \\r\\n\\t\\tquasi-legitimate reasons for taking a break -- which I\\x92m very happy to \\r\\n\\t\\thave provided. I want to thank Jas for his \\r\\n\\t\\tintroductory remarks, and clearly, those of you who are in the Foreign \\r\\n\\t\\tService School heard reflections of the extraordinary opportunity you\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen given to study here as he spoke about the culture of human rights. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt is also a real honor for me to be delivering this speech at \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorgetown, because there is no better place than this university to \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk about human rights. And President DeGioia, the administration, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe faculty embody the university\\x92s long tradition of supporting free \\r\\n\\t\\texpression and free inquiry and the cause of human rights around the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. I know that President \\r\\n\\t\\tDeGioia himself has taught a course on human rights, as well as on the \\r\\n\\t\\tethics of international development with one of my longtime colleagues, \\r\\n\\t\\tCarol Lancaster, the acting dean of the School of Foreign Service. And I \\r\\n\\t\\twant to commend the faculty here who are helping to shape our thinking \\r\\n\\t\\ton human rights, on conflict resolution, on development and related \\r\\n\\t\\tsubjects. It is important to be at this university because the students \\r\\n\\t\\there, the faculty, every single year add to the interreligious dialogue. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou give voice to many advocates and activists who are working on the \\r\\n\\t\\tfront lines of the global human rights movement, through the Human \\r\\n\\t\\tRights Institute here at the law school and other programs. And the \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities that you provide your students to work in an international \\r\\n\\t\\twomen\\x92s rights clinic are especially close to my heart. All of these efforts reflect \\r\\n\\t\\tthe deep commitment of the Georgetown administration, faculty, and \\r\\n\\t\\tstudents to this cause. So first and foremost, I am here to say thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. Thank you for keeping human rights front and center. Thank you for \\r\\n\\t\\ttraining the next generation of human rights advocates, and more \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerally, introducing students who may never be an activist, may never \\r\\n\\t\\twork for Amnesty International or any other organization specifically \\r\\n\\t\\tdevoted to human rights, but who will leave this university with it \\r\\n\\t\\timbued in their hearts and minds. So thank you, President DeGioia, for \\r\\n\\t\\tall that you do and all that Georgetown has done. Today, I want to speak to \\r\\n\\t\\tyou about the Obama Administration\\x92s human rights agenda for the 21st \\r\\n\\t\\tcentury. It is a subject on the minds of many people who are eager to \\r\\n\\t\\thear our approach, and understandably so, because it is a critical issue \\r\\n\\t\\tthat warrants our energy and our attention. My comments today will \\r\\n\\t\\tprovide an overview of our thinking on human rights and democracy and \\r\\n\\t\\thow they fit into our broader foreign policy, as well as the principles \\r\\n\\t\\tand policies that guide our approach. But let me also say that \\r\\n\\t\\twhat this is not. It could not be a comprehensive accounting of abuses \\r\\n\\t\\tor nations with whom we have raised human rights concerns. It could not \\r\\n\\t\\tbe and is not a checklist or a scorecard. We issue a Human Rights Report \\r\\n\\t\\tevery year and that goes into great detail on the concerns we have for \\r\\n\\t\\tmany countries. But I hope that we can use this opportunity to look at \\r\\n\\t\\tthis important issue in a broader light and appreciate its full \\r\\n\\t\\tcomplexity, moral weight, and urgency. And with that, let me turn to the \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness at hand. In hisacceptance speech for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Nobel Peace Prizelast week, President Obama said that while war is \\r\\n\\t\\tnever welcome or good, it will sometimes be right and necessary, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause, in his words, \\x93Only a just peace based upon the inherent rights \\r\\n\\t\\tand dignity of every individual can be truly lasting.\\x94 Throughout \\r\\n\\t\\thistory and in our own time, there have been those who violently deny \\r\\n\\t\\tthat truth. Our mission is to embrace it, to work for lasting peace \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough a principled human rights agenda, and a practical strategy to \\r\\n\\t\\timplement it. President Obama\\x92s speech \\r\\n\\t\\talso reminded us that our basic values, the ones enshrined in our \\r\\n\\t\\tDeclaration of Independence -- the rights to life, liberty, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tpursuit of happiness -- are not only the source of our strength and \\r\\n\\t\\tendurance; they are the birthright of every woman, man, and child on \\r\\n\\t\\tearth. That is also the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human \\r\\n\\t\\tRights, the prerequisite for building a world in which every person has \\r\\n\\t\\tthe opportunity to live up to his or her God-given potential, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tpower behind every movement for freedom, every campaign for democracy, \\r\\n\\t\\tevery effort to foster development, and every struggle against \\r\\n\\t\\toppression. The potential within every \\r\\n\\t\\tperson to learn, discover and embrace the world around them, the \\r\\n\\t\\tpotential to join freely with others to shape their communities and \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir societies so that every person can find fulfillment and \\r\\n\\t\\tself-sufficiency, the potential to share life\\x92s beauties and tragedies, \\r\\n\\t\\tlaughter and tears with the people we love -- that potential is sacred. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat, however, is a dangerous belief to many who hold power and who \\r\\n\\t\\tconstruct their position against an \\x93other\\x94 -- another tribe or religion \\r\\n\\t\\tor race or gender or political party. Standing up against that false \\r\\n\\t\\tsense of identity and expanding the circle of rights and opportunities \\r\\n\\t\\tto all people -- advancing their freedoms and possibilities -- is why we \\r\\n\\t\\tdo what we do. This week we observe Human \\r\\n\\t\\tRights Week. At the State Department, though, every week is Human Rights \\r\\n\\t\\tWeek. Sixty-one years ago this month, the world\\x92s leaders proclaimed a \\r\\n\\t\\tnew framework of rights, laws, and institutions that could fulfill the \\r\\n\\t\\tvow of \\x93never again.\\x94 They affirmed the universality of human rights \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough the Universal Declaration and legal agreements including those \\r\\n\\t\\taimed at combating genocide, war crimes and torture, and challenging \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscrimination against women and racial and religious minorities. \\r\\n\\t\\tBurgeoning civil society movements and nongovernmental organizations \\r\\n\\t\\tbecame essential partners in advancing the principle that every person \\r\\n\\t\\tcounts, and in exposing those who violate that standard. As we celebrate that \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress, though, our focus must be on the work that remains to be done. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights encourages us \\r\\n\\t\\tto use it as a, quote, \\x93standard of achievement.\\x94 And so we should. But \\r\\n\\t\\twe cannot deny the gap that remains between its eloquent promises and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe life experiences of so many of our fellow human beings. Now, we must \\r\\n\\t\\tfinish the job. Our human rights agenda for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 21st century is to make human rights a human reality, and the first \\r\\n\\t\\tstep is to see human rights in a broad context. Of course, people must \\r\\n\\t\\tbe free from the oppression of tyranny, from torture, from \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscrimination, from the fear of leaders who will imprison or \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93disappear\\x94 them. But they also must be free from the oppression of want \\r\\n\\t\\t-- want of food, want of health, want of education, and want of equality \\r\\n\\t\\tin law and in fact. To fulfill their potential, \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople must be free to choose laws and leaders; to share and access \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation, to speak, criticize, and debate. They must be free to \\r\\n\\t\\tworship, associate, and to love in the way that they choose. And they \\r\\n\\t\\tmust be free to pursue the dignity that comes with self-improvement and \\r\\n\\t\\tself-reliance, to build their minds and their skills, to bring their \\r\\n\\t\\tgoods to the marketplace, and participate in the process of innovation. \\r\\n\\t\\tHuman rights have both negative and positive requirements. People should \\r\\n\\t\\tbe free from tyranny in whatever form, and they should also be free to \\r\\n\\t\\tseize the opportunities of a full life. That is why supporting democracy \\r\\n\\t\\tand fostering development are cornerstones of our 21st century human \\r\\n\\t\\trights agenda. This Administration, like \\r\\n\\t\\tothers before us, will promote, support, and defend democracy. We will \\r\\n\\t\\trelinquish neither the word nor the idea to those who have used it too \\r\\n\\t\\tnarrowly, or to justify unwise policies. We stand for democracy not \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we want other countries to be like us, but because we want all \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople to enjoy the consistent protection of the rights that are \\r\\n\\t\\tnaturally theirs, whether they were born in Tallahassee or Tehran. \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocracy has proven the best political system for making human rights a \\r\\n\\t\\thuman reality over the long term. But it is crucial that we \\r\\n\\t\\tclarify what we mean when we talk about democracy, because democracy \\r\\n\\t\\tmeans not only elections to choose leaders, but also active citizens and \\r\\n\\t\\ta free press and an independent judiciary and transparent and responsive \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions that are accountable to all citizens and protect their \\r\\n\\t\\trights equally and fairly. In democracies, respecting rights isn\\x92t a \\r\\n\\t\\tchoice leaders make day by day; it is the reason they govern. \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocracies protect and respect citizens every day, not just on Election \\r\\n\\t\\tDay. And democracies demonstrate their greatness not by insisting they \\r\\n\\t\\tare perfect, but by using their institutions and their principles to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake themselves and their union more perfect, just as our country \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinues to do after 233 years. At the same time, human \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment must also be part of our human rights agenda. Because basic \\r\\n\\t\\tlevels of well-being -- food, shelter, health, and education -- and of \\r\\n\\t\\tpublic common goods like environmental sustainability, protection \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst pandemic disease, provisions for refugees -- are necessary for \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople to exercise their rights, and because human development and \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocracy are mutually reinforcing. Democratic governments are not \\r\\n\\t\\tlikely to survive long if their citizens do not have the basic \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessities of life. The desperation caused by poverty and disease often \\r\\n\\t\\tleads to violence that further imperils the rights of people and \\r\\n\\t\\tthreatens the stability of governments. Democracies that deliver on \\r\\n\\t\\trights, opportunities, and development for their people are stable, \\r\\n\\t\\tstrong, and most likely to enable people to live up to their potential. So human rights, democracy, \\r\\n\\t\\tand development are not three separate goals with three separate \\r\\n\\t\\tagendas. That view doesn\\x92t reflect the reality we face. To make a real \\r\\n\\t\\tand long-term difference in people\\x92s lives, we have to tackle all three \\r\\n\\t\\tsimultaneously with a commitment that is smart, strategic, determined, \\r\\n\\t\\tand long-term. We should measure our success by asking this question: \\r\\n\\t\\tAre more people in more places better able to exercise their universal \\r\\n\\t\\trights and live up to their potential because of our actions? Our principles are our North \\r\\n\\t\\tStar, but our tools and tactics must be flexible and reflect the reality \\r\\n\\t\\ton the ground wherever we are trying to have a positive impact. Now, in \\r\\n\\t\\tsome cases, governments are willing but unable without support to \\r\\n\\t\\testablish strong institutions and protections for citizens -- for \\r\\n\\t\\texample, the nascent democracies in Africa. And we can extend our hand \\r\\n\\t\\tas a partner to help them try to achieve authority and build the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress they desire. In other cases, like Cuba or Nigeria, governments \\r\\n\\t\\tare able but unwilling to make the changes their citizens deserve. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere, we must vigorously press leaders to end repression, while \\r\\n\\t\\tsupporting those within societies who are working for change. And in \\r\\n\\t\\tcases where governments are both unwilling and unable -- places like the \\r\\n\\t\\teastern Congo -- we have to support those courageous individuals and \\r\\n\\t\\torganizations who try to protect people and who battle against the odds \\r\\n\\t\\tto plant seeds for a more hopeful future. Now, I don\\x92t need to tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou that challenges we face are diverse and complicated. And there is \\r\\n\\t\\tnot one approach or formula, doctrine or theory that can be easily \\r\\n\\t\\tapplied to every situation. But I want to outline four elements of the \\r\\n\\t\\tObama Administration\\x92s approach to putting our principles into action, \\r\\n\\t\\tand share with you some of the challenges we face in doing so. First, a commitment to human \\r\\n\\t\\trights starts with universal standards and with holding everyone \\r\\n\\t\\taccountable to those standards, including ourselves. On his second full \\r\\n\\t\\tday in office, President Obama issued an executive order prohibiting the \\r\\n\\t\\tuse of torture or official cruelty by any U.S. official and ordered the \\r\\n\\t\\tclosure of Guantanamo Bay. Next year, we will report on human \\r\\n\\t\\ttrafficking, as we do every year, but this time, not only just on other \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries, but also on our own. And we will participate through the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited Nations in the Universal Periodic Review of our own human rights \\r\\n\\t\\trecord, just as we encourage other nations to do. By holding ourselves \\r\\n\\t\\taccountable, we reinforce our moral authority to demand that all \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments adhere to obligations under international law; among them, \\r\\n\\t\\tnot to torture, arbitrarily detain and persecute dissenters, or engage \\r\\n\\t\\tin political killings. Our government and the international community \\r\\n\\t\\tmust counter the pretensions of those who deny or abdicate their \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibilities and hold violators to account. Sometimes, we will have the \\r\\n\\t\\tmost impact by publicly denouncing a government action, like the coup in \\r\\n\\t\\tHonduras or violence in Guinea. Other times, we will be more likely to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp the oppressed by engaging in tough negotiations behind closed \\r\\n\\t\\tdoors, like pressing China and Russia as part of our broader agenda. In \\r\\n\\t\\tevery instance, our aim will be to make a difference, not to prove a \\r\\n\\t\\tpoint. Calling for accountability \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\x92t start or stop, however, at naming offenders. Our goal is to \\r\\n\\t\\tencourage -- even demand -- that governments must also take responsibility \\r\\n\\t\\tby putting human rights into law and embedding them in government \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions; by building strong, independent courts, competent and \\r\\n\\t\\tdisciplined police and law enforcement. And once rights are established, \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments should be expected to resist the temptation to restrict \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom of expression when criticism arises, and to be vigilant in \\r\\n\\t\\tpreventing law from becoming an instrument of oppression, as bills like \\r\\n\\t\\tthe one under consideration in Uganda would do to criminalize \\r\\n\\t\\thomosexuality. We know that all governments \\r\\n\\t\\tand all leaders sometimes fall short. So there have to be internal \\r\\n\\t\\tmechanisms of accountability when rights are violated. Often the \\r\\n\\t\\ttoughest test for governments, which is essential to the protection of \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights, is absorbing and accepting criticism. And here too, we \\r\\n\\t\\tshould lead by example. In the last six decades we have done this -- \\r\\n\\t\\timperfectly at times but with significant outcomes -- from making amends \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the internment of our own Japanese American citizens in World War \\r\\n\\t\\tII, to establishing legal recourse for victims of discrimination in the \\r\\n\\t\\tJim Crow South, to passing hate crimes legislation to include attacks \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst gays and lesbians. When injustice anywhere is ignored, justice \\r\\n\\t\\teverywhere is denied. Acknowledging and remedying mistakes does not make \\r\\n\\t\\tus weaker, it reaffirms the strength of our principles and institutions. Second, we must be pragmatic \\r\\n\\t\\tand agile in pursuit of our human rights agenda -- not compromising on \\r\\n\\t\\tour principles, but doing what is most likely to make them real. And we \\r\\n\\t\\twill use all the tools at our disposal, and when we run up against a \\r\\n\\t\\twall, we will not retreat with resignation or recriminations, or \\r\\n\\t\\trepeatedly run up against the same well, but respond with strategic \\r\\n\\t\\tresolve to find another way to effect change and improve people\\x92s lives. We acknowledge that one size \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes not fit all. And when old approaches aren\\x92t working, we won\\x92t be \\r\\n\\t\\tafraid to attempt new ones, as we have this year by ending the stalemate \\r\\n\\t\\tof isolation and instead pursuing measured engagement with Burma. In \\r\\n\\t\\tIran, we have offered to negotiate directly with the government on \\r\\n\\t\\tnuclear issues, but have at the same time expressed solidarity with \\r\\n\\t\\tthose inside Iran struggling for democratic change. As President Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid in his Nobel speech, \\x93They have us on their side.\\x94 And we will hold governments \\r\\n\\t\\taccountable for their actions, as we have just recently by terminating \\r\\n\\t\\tMillennium Challenge Corporation grants this year for Madagascar and \\r\\n\\t\\tNiger in the wake of government behavior. As the President said last \\r\\n\\t\\tweek, \\x93we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement; \\r\\n\\t\\tpressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced \\r\\n\\t\\tover time.\\x94 We are also working for \\r\\n\\t\\tpositive change within multilateral institutions. They are valuable \\r\\n\\t\\ttools that, when in their best, leverage the efforts of many countries \\r\\n\\t\\taround a common purpose. So we have rejoined the UN Human Rights Council \\r\\n\\t\\tnot because we don\\x92t see its flaws, but because we think that \\r\\n\\t\\tparticipating gives us the best chance to be a constructive influence. In our first session, we \\r\\n\\t\\tcosponsored the successful resolution on Freedom of Expression, a \\r\\n\\t\\tforceful declaration of principle at a time when that freedom is \\r\\n\\t\\tjeopardized by new efforts to constrain religious practice, including \\r\\n\\t\\trecently in Switzerland, and by efforts to criminalize the defamation of \\r\\n\\t\\treligion -- a false solution which exchanges one wrong for another. And \\r\\n\\t\\tin the United Nations Security Council, I was privileged to chair the \\r\\n\\t\\tSeptember session where we passed a resolution mandating protections \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst sexual violence in armed conflict. Principled pragmatism \\r\\n\\t\\tinforms our approach on human rights with all countries, but \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly with key countries like China and Russia. Cooperation with \\r\\n\\t\\teach of those is critical to the health of the global economy and the \\r\\n\\t\\tnonproliferation agenda we seek, also to managing security issues like \\r\\n\\t\\tNorth Korea and Iran, and addressing global problems like climate \\r\\n\\t\\tchange. The United States seeks \\r\\n\\t\\tpositive relationships with China and Russia, and that means candid \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscussions of divergent views. In China, we call for protection of \\r\\n\\t\\trights of minorities in Tibet and Xinxiang; for the rights to express \\r\\n\\t\\toneself and worship freely; and for civil society and religious \\r\\n\\t\\torganizations to advocate their positions within a framework of the rule \\r\\n\\t\\tof law. And we believe strongly that those who advocate peacefully for \\r\\n\\t\\treform within the constitution, such as Charter 2008 signatories, should \\r\\n\\t\\tnot be prosecuted. With Russia, we deplore the \\r\\n\\t\\tmurders of journalists and activists and support the courageous \\r\\n\\t\\tindividuals who advocate at great peril for democracy. With China, \\r\\n\\t\\tRussia, and others, we are engaging on issues of mutual interest while \\r\\n\\t\\talso engaging societal actors in these same countries who are working to \\r\\n\\t\\tadvance human rights and democracy. The assumption that we must either \\r\\n\\t\\tpursue human rights or our \\x93national interests\\x94 is wrong. The assumption \\r\\n\\t\\tthat only coercion and isolation are effective tools for advancing \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocratic change is also wrong. Across our diplomacy and \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment efforts, we keep striving for innovative ways to achieve \\r\\n\\t\\tresults. That\\x92s why I commissioned the first-ever Quadrennial Diplomacy \\r\\n\\t\\tand Development Review to develop a forward-looking strategy built on \\r\\n\\t\\tanalysis of our objectives, our challenges, our tools, and our \\r\\n\\t\\tcapacities to achieve America\\x92s foreign policy and national security \\r\\n\\t\\tobjectives. And make no mistake, issues of Democracy and Governance -- \\r\\n\\t\\tD&G as they are called at USAID -- are central to this review. The third element of our \\r\\n\\t\\tapproach is that we support change driven by citizens and their \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunities. The project of making human rights a human reality cannot \\r\\n\\t\\tbe just one for governments. It requires cooperation among individuals \\r\\n\\t\\tand organizations within communities and across borders. It means that \\r\\n\\t\\twe work with others who share our commitment to securing lives of \\r\\n\\t\\tdignity for all who share the bonds of humanity. Six weeks ago, in Morocco, I \\r\\n\\t\\tmet with civil society activists from across the Middle East and North \\r\\n\\t\\tAfrica. They exemplify how lasting change comes from within and how it \\r\\n\\t\\tdepends on activists who create the space in which engaged citizens and \\r\\n\\t\\tcivil society can build the foundations for rights-respecting \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment and democracy. Outside governments and global civil society \\r\\n\\t\\tcannot impose change, but we can promote and bolster it and defend it. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe can encourage and provide support for local grassroots leaders, \\r\\n\\t\\tproviding a lifeline of protection to human rights and democracy \\r\\n\\t\\tactivists when they get in trouble, as they often do, for raising \\r\\n\\t\\tsensitive issues and voicing dissent. This means using tools like our \\r\\n\\t\\tGlobal Human Rights Defenders Fund, which in the last year has provided \\r\\n\\t\\ttargeted legal and relocation assistance to 170 human rights defenders \\r\\n\\t\\taround the world. And we can stand with these \\r\\n\\t\\tdefenders publicly, as we have by sending a high-level diplomatic \\r\\n\\t\\tmission to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, and as I have done around the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld, from Guatemala to Kenya to Egypt, speaking out for civil society \\r\\n\\t\\tand political leaders who are working to try to change their societies \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom within, and also working through the backchannels for the safety of \\r\\n\\t\\tdissidents and protecting them from persecution. We can amplify the voices of \\r\\n\\t\\tactivists and advocates working on these issues by shining a spotlight \\r\\n\\t\\ton their progress. They often pursue their mission in isolation, often \\r\\n\\t\\tso marginalized within their own societies. And we can endorse the \\r\\n\\t\\tlegitimacy of their efforts. We recognize these with honors like the \\r\\n\\t\\tWomen of Courage awards that First Lady Michelle Obama and I presented \\r\\n\\t\\tearlier this year and the Human Rights Defenders award I will present \\r\\n\\t\\tnext month, and we can applaud others like Vital Voices, the RFK Center \\r\\n\\t\\tfor Justice and Human Rights, and the Lantos Foundation, that do the \\r\\n\\t\\tsame. We can give them access to \\r\\n\\t\\tpublic forums that lend visibility to their ideas, and continue to press \\r\\n\\t\\tfor a role for nongovernmental organizations in multilateral \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions like the United Nations and the OSCE. And we can enlist \\r\\n\\t\\tother allies like international labor unions who were instrumental in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Solidarity movement in Poland or religious organizations who are \\r\\n\\t\\tchampioning the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa. We can help change agents, \\r\\n\\t\\tgain access to and share information through the internet and mobile \\r\\n\\t\\tphones so that they can communicate and organize. With camera phones and \\r\\n\\t\\tFacebook pages, thousands of protestors in Iran have broadcast their \\r\\n\\t\\tdemands for rights denied, creating a record for all the world, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding Iran\\x92s leaders, to see. I\\x92ve established a special unit inside \\r\\n\\t\\tthe State Department to use technology for 21st century statecraft. In virtually every country I \\r\\n\\t\\tvisit -- from Indonesia to Iraq, from South Korea to the Dominican \\r\\n\\t\\tRepublic -- I conduct a town hall or roundtable discussion with groups \\r\\n\\t\\toutside of government to learn from them, and to provide a platform for \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir voices, ideas, and opinions. When I was recently in Russia, I \\r\\n\\t\\tvisited an independent radio station to give an interview, and express \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough word and deed our support for independent media at a time when \\r\\n\\t\\tfree expression is under threat. On my visits to China, I \\r\\n\\t\\thave made a point of meeting with women activists. The UN Conference on \\r\\n\\t\\tWomen in Beijing in 1995 inspired a generation of women civil society \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders who have become rights defenders for today\\x92s China. In 1998, I \\r\\n\\t\\tmet with a small group of lawyers in a crowded apartment on the fifth \\r\\n\\t\\tfloor of a walk-up building. They described for me their efforts to win \\r\\n\\t\\trights for women to own property, have a say in marriage and divorce, \\r\\n\\t\\tand be treated as equal citizens. When I visited China again \\r\\n\\t\\tearlier this year, I met with some of the same women, but this group had \\r\\n\\t\\tgrown and expanded its scope. Now there were women working not just for \\r\\n\\t\\tlegal rights, but for environmental, health, and economic rights as \\r\\n\\t\\twell. Yet one of them, Dr. Gao \\r\\n\\t\\tYaojie, has been harassed for speaking out about AIDS in China. She \\r\\n\\t\\tshould instead be applauded by her government for helping to confront \\r\\n\\t\\tthe crisis. NGOs and civil society leaders need the financial, technical \\r\\n\\t\\tand political support we provide. Many repressive regimes have tried to \\r\\n\\t\\tlimit the independence and effectiveness of activists and NGOs by \\r\\n\\t\\trestricting their activities, including more than 25 governments that \\r\\n\\t\\thave recently adopted new restrictions. But our funding and support can \\r\\n\\t\\tgive a foothold to local organizations, training programs, and \\r\\n\\t\\tindependent media. And of course, one of the most important ways that we \\r\\n\\t\\tand others in the international community can lay the foundation for \\r\\n\\t\\tchange from the bottom up is through targeted assistance to those in \\r\\n\\t\\tneed, and through partnerships that foster broad-based economic \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment. To build success for the \\r\\n\\t\\tlong run, our development assistance needs to be as effective as \\r\\n\\t\\tpossible at delivering results and paving the way for broad-based growth \\r\\n\\t\\tand long-term self-reliance. Beyond giving people the capacity to meet \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir material needs for today, economic empowerment should give them a \\r\\n\\t\\tstake in securing their own futures, in seeing their societies become \\r\\n\\t\\tthe kind of democracies that protect rights and govern fairly. So we \\r\\n\\t\\twill pursue a rights-respecting approach to development -- consulting \\r\\n\\t\\twith local communities, ensuring transparency, midwifeing accountable \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions -- so our development activities act in concert with our \\r\\n\\t\\tefforts to support democratic governance. That is the pressing challenge \\r\\n\\t\\twe face in Afghanistan and Pakistan today. The fourth element of our \\r\\n\\t\\tapproach is that we will widen our focus. We will not forget that \\r\\n\\t\\tpositive change must be reinforced and strengthened where hope is on the \\r\\n\\t\\trise, and we will not ignore or overlook places of seemingly intractable \\r\\n\\t\\ttragedy and despair. Where human lives hang in the balance, we must do \\r\\n\\t\\twhat we can to tilt that balance toward a better future. Our efforts to support those \\r\\n\\t\\tworking for human rights, economic empowerment, and democratic \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernance are driven by commitment, not convenience. But they have to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe sustained. They cannot be subject to the whims or the wins of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical change in our own country. Democratic progress is urgent but \\r\\n\\t\\tit is not quick, and we should never take for granted its permanence. \\r\\n\\t\\tBacksliding is always a threat, as we\\x92ve learned in places like Kenya \\r\\n\\t\\twhere the perpetrators of post-election violence have thus far escaped \\r\\n\\t\\tjustice; and in the Americas where we are worried about leaders who have \\r\\n\\t\\tseized property, trampled rights, and abused justice to enhance personal \\r\\n\\t\\trule. And when democratic change \\r\\n\\t\\toccurs, we cannot afford to become complacent. Instead, we have to \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue reinforcing NGOs and the fledgling institutions of democracy. \\r\\n\\t\\tYoung democracies like Liberia, East Timor, Moldova and Kosovo need our \\r\\n\\t\\thelp to secure improvements in health, education and welfare. We must \\r\\n\\t\\tstay engaged to nurture democratic development in places like Ukraine \\r\\n\\t\\tand Georgia, which experienced democratic breakthroughs earlier this \\r\\n\\t\\tdecade but have struggled to consolidate their democratic gains because \\r\\n\\t\\tof both internal and external factors. So we stand ready -- both in \\r\\n\\t\\tour bilateral relationships and through international institutions -- to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp governments that have committed to improving themselves by \\r\\n\\t\\tassisting them in fighting corruption and helping train police forces \\r\\n\\t\\tand public servants. And we will support regional organizations and \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions like the Organization of American States, the African \\r\\n\\t\\tUnion, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where they take \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir own steps to defend democratic principles and institutions. Success stories deserve our \\r\\n\\t\\tattention so they continue to make progress and also serve as a model \\r\\n\\t\\tfor others. And even as we reinforce the successes, conscience demands \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we are not cowed by the overwhelming difficulty of making inroads \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst misery in the hard places like Sudan, Congo, North Korea, \\r\\n\\t\\tZimbabwe, or on the hard issues like ending gender inequality and \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscrimination against gays and lesbians, from the Middle East to Latin \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica, Africa to Asia. Now, we have to continue to \\r\\n\\t\\tpress for solutions in Sudan where ongoing tensions threaten to add to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe devastation wrought bygenocide in Darfurand an overwhelming \\r\\n\\t\\trefugee crisis. We will work to identify ways that we and our partners \\r\\n\\t\\tcan enhance human security, while at the same time focusing greater \\r\\n\\t\\tattention on efforts to prevent genocide elsewhere. And of course, we have to \\r\\n\\t\\tremain focused on women -- women\\x92s rights, women\\x92s roles, and women\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibilities.As I said in Beijing in 1995, \\x93human rights are \\r\\n\\t\\twomen\\x92s rights, and women\\x92s rights are human rights,\\x94 but oh, I wish it \\r\\n\\t\\tcould be so easily translated into action and changes. That ideal is far \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom being realized in so many places around our world, but there is no \\r\\n\\t\\tplace that so epitomizes the very difficult, tragic circumstances \\r\\n\\t\\tconfronting women than in eastern Congo. I was in Goma last August, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe epicenter of one of the most violent and chaotic regions on earth. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd when I was there, I met with victims of horrific gender and sexual \\r\\n\\t\\tviolence, and I met with refugees driven from their homes by the many \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary forces operating there. I heard from those working to end the \\r\\n\\t\\tconflicts and to protect the victims in such dire circumstances. I saw \\r\\n\\t\\tthe best and the worst of humanity in a single day, the unspeakable acts \\r\\n\\t\\tof violence that have left women physically and emotionally brutalized, \\r\\n\\t\\tand the heroism of the women and men themselves, of the doctors, nurses \\r\\n\\t\\tand volunteers working to repair bodies and spirits. They are on the front lines \\r\\n\\t\\tof the struggle for human rights. Seeing firsthand their courage and \\r\\n\\t\\ttenacity of they and the Congolese people and the internal fortitude \\r\\n\\t\\tthat keeps them going is not only humbling, but inspires me every day to \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep working. So those four aspects of our \\r\\n\\t\\tapproach -- accountability, principled pragmatism, partnering from the \\r\\n\\t\\tbottom up, keeping a wide focus where rights are at stake -- will help \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild a foundation that enables people to stand and rise above poverty, \\r\\n\\t\\thunger, and disease and that secures their rights under democratic \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernance. We must lift the ceiling of oppression, corruption, and \\r\\n\\t\\tviolence. And we must light a fire of \\r\\n\\t\\thuman potential through access to education and economic opportunity. \\r\\n\\t\\tBuild the foundation, lift the ceiling, and light the fire all together, \\r\\n\\t\\tall at once. Because when a person has food and education but not the \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom to discuss and debate with fellow citizens, he is denied the \\r\\n\\t\\tlife he deserves. And when a person is too hungry or sick to work or \\r\\n\\t\\tvote or worship, she is denied a life she deserves. Freedom doesn\\x92t come \\r\\n\\t\\tin half measures, and partial remedies cannot redress the whole problem. But we know that the \\r\\n\\t\\tchampions of human potential have never had it easy. We may call rights \\r\\n\\t\\tinalienable, but making them so has always been hard work. And no matter \\r\\n\\t\\thow clearly we see our ideals, taking action to make them real requires \\r\\n\\t\\ttough choices. Even if everyone agrees that we should do whatever is \\r\\n\\t\\tmost likely to improve the lives of people on the ground, we will not \\r\\n\\t\\talways agree on what course of action fits that description in every \\r\\n\\t\\tcase. That is the nature of governing. We all know examples of good \\r\\n\\t\\tintentions that did not produce results, some that even produced \\r\\n\\t\\tunintended consequences that led to greater violations of human rights. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd we can learn from the instances in which we have fallen short in the \\r\\n\\t\\tpast, because those past difficulties are proof of how difficult \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress is, but we do not accept the argument by some that progress in \\r\\n\\t\\tcertain places is impossible, because we know progress happens. Ghana emerged from an era of \\r\\n\\t\\tcoups to one of stable democratic governance. Indonesia moved from \\r\\n\\t\\trepressive rule to a dynamic democracy that is Islamic and secular. \\r\\n\\t\\tChile exchanged dictatorship for democracy and an open economy. \\r\\n\\t\\tMongolia\\x92s constitutional reforms successfully ushered in multiparty \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocracy without violence. And there is no better example than the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress made in Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin \\r\\n\\t\\tWall 20 years ago, an event I was privileged to help celebrate last \\r\\n\\t\\tmonth at the Brandenburg Gate. While the work in front of \\r\\n\\t\\tus is daunting and vast, we face the future together with partners on \\r\\n\\t\\tevery continent, partners in faith-based organizations, NGOs, and \\r\\n\\t\\tsocially responsible corporations, and partners in governments. From \\r\\n\\t\\tIndia, the world\\x92s largest democracy, and one that continues to use \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocratic processes and principles to perfect its union of 1.1 billion \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople, to Botswana where the new president in Africa\\x92s oldest democracy \\r\\n\\t\\thas promised to govern according to what he calls the \\x935 Ds\\x94 -- \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocracy, dignity, development, discipline, and delivery -- providing a \\r\\n\\t\\trecipe for responsible governance that contrasts starkly with the \\r\\n\\t\\tunnecessary and manmade tragedy in neighboring Zimbabwe. In the end, this isn\\x92t just \\r\\n\\t\\tabout what we do; it is about who we are. And we cannot be the people we \\r\\n\\t\\tare -- people who believe in human rights -- if we opt out of this fight. \\r\\n\\t\\tBelieving in human rights means committing ourselves to action, and when \\r\\n\\t\\twe sign up for the promise of rights that apply everywhere, to everyone, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat rights will be able to protect and enable human dignity, we also \\r\\n\\t\\tsign up for the hard work of making that promise a reality. Those of you here at this \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat university spend time studying the cases of what we\\x92ve tried to do \\r\\n\\t\\tin human rights, or as Jas said, the culture of human rights. You see \\r\\n\\t\\tthe shortcomings and the shortfalls. You see the fact that, as Mario \\r\\n\\t\\tCuomo famously said about politics here in the United States, we \\r\\n\\t\\tcampaign in poetry and we govern in prose. Well, that\\x92s true \\r\\n\\t\\tinternationally as well. But we need your ideas, we need your criticism, \\r\\n\\t\\twe need your support, we need your intelligent analysis of how together \\r\\n\\t\\twe can slowly, steadily expand that circle of opportunity and rights to \\r\\n\\t\\tevery single person. It is work that we take so \\r\\n\\t\\tseriously. It is work that we know we don\\x92t have all the answers for. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut it is the work that America signed up to do. And we will continue, \\r\\n\\t\\tday by day, inch by inch, to try to make whatever progress is humanly \\r\\n\\t\\tpossible. Thank you all very much.  Moderator:Thank you, Secretary Clinton, for an inspiring, \\r\\n\\t\\tcomprehensive, and wonderful speech. It made me proud to be an American. Secretary Clinton:Thank you so much. Moderator:And proud to be at Georgetown, too. The Secretary has time for three questions, and we thought because so \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of you have abandoned your final papers to be here -- the students, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat is -- that we would take those questions from our students. So let \\r\\n\\t\\tme ask you -- we have several people along the sides with microphones. \\r\\n\\t\\tLet -- okay, here\\x92s somebody with a microphone. Have we got one more? \\r\\n\\t\\tOkay. So let\\x92s have a first question from a student. That doesn't look like a \\r\\n\\t\\tstudent. Let\\x92s get -- here, let\\x92s get a young person here. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92re not discriminating. We just want a calm approach to things. Question:Hello, Secretary Clinton. Thank you so much for speaking to us \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday. You spoke about the situation in Uganda. Could you please talk to \\r\\n\\t\\tus a little bit more about how the United States can protect the rights \\r\\n\\t\\tof LGBT people in areas where those rights are not respected? Secretary Clinton:Yes. And first let me say that over this past year, \\r\\n\\t\\twe have elevated into our human rights dialogues and our public \\r\\n\\t\\tstatements a very clear message about protecting the rights of the LGBT \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunity worldwide. And we are particularly concerned about some of the \\r\\n\\t\\tspecific cases that have come to our attention around the world. There \\r\\n\\t\\thave been organized efforts to kill and maim gays and lesbians in some \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries that we have spoken out about, and also conveyed our very \\r\\n\\t\\tstrong concerns about to their governments -- not that they were \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernmentally implemented or even that the government was aware of \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, but that the governments need to pay much greater attention to the \\r\\n\\t\\tkinds of abuses that we\\x92ve seen in Iraq, for example. We are deeply concerned about some of the stories coming out of Iran. In \\r\\n\\t\\tlarge measure, in reaction, we think, to the response to the elections \\r\\n\\t\\tback in June, there have been abuses committed within the detention \\r\\n\\t\\tfacilities and elsewhere that we are deeply concerned about. And then \\r\\n\\t\\tthe example that I used of a piece of legislation in Uganda which would \\r\\n\\t\\tnot only criminalize homosexuality but attach the death penalty to it. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe have expressed our concerns directly, indirectly, and we will \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to do so. The bill has not gone through the Ugandan \\r\\n\\t\\tlegislature, but it has a lot of public support by various groups, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding religious leaders in Uganda. And we view it as a very serious \\r\\n\\t\\tpotential violation of human rights. So it is clear that across the world this is a new frontier in the minds \\r\\n\\t\\tof many people about how we protect the LGBT community, but it is at the \\r\\n\\t\\ttop of our list because we see many instances where there is a very \\r\\n\\t\\tserious assault on the physical safety and an increasing effort to \\r\\n\\t\\tmarginalize people. And we think it\\x92s important for the United States to \\r\\n\\t\\tstand against that and to enlist others to join us in doing so. Moderator:Right here. Question:Good morning, Secretary Clinton. Thank you so much for being \\r\\n\\t\\there at Georgetown. You brought up Iran today, and I really appreciate \\r\\n\\t\\tthat as an Iranian American. I\\x92m a graduate student here and had the \\r\\n\\t\\tpleasure of being in Iran this summer for my first trip, and to witness \\r\\n\\t\\treally what happened after the election was an incredible moment in \\r\\n\\t\\thistory. Now that six months has passed after the election, what can the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates do to balance our support of the human rights activists and \\r\\n\\t\\tdemonstrators in the streets of Iran with our agenda regarding the \\r\\n\\t\\tbroader international security issues with Iran\\x92s proposed nuclear \\r\\n\\t\\tprogram? So how do we balance those two issues? Secretary Clinton:Right. Well, it is a balancing act. But the more \\r\\n\\t\\timportant balancing act is to make sure that our very strong opposition \\r\\n\\t\\tto what is going on inside Iran doesn't in any way undermine the \\r\\n\\t\\tlegitimacy of the protest movement that has taken hold. Now, this is one \\r\\n\\t\\tof those very good examples of a hard call. After the election and the \\r\\n\\t\\treaction that began almost immediately by people who felt that the \\r\\n\\t\\telection was invalid, put us in a position of seriously considering what \\r\\n\\t\\tis the best way we can support those who are putting their lives on the \\r\\n\\t\\tline by going into the streets. We wanted to convey clear support, but \\r\\n\\t\\twe didn\\x92t want the attention shifted from the legitimate concerns to the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States, because we had nothing to do with the spontaneous \\r\\n\\t\\treaction that grew up in response to the behavior of the Iranian \\r\\n\\t\\tGovernment. So it\\x92s been a delicate walk, but I think that the activists inside Iran \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that we support them. We have certainly encouraged their continuing \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunication of what\\x92s going on inside Iran. One of the calls that we \\r\\n\\t\\tmade shortly after the election in the midst of the demonstrations is \\r\\n\\t\\tthis unit of these very tech-savvy young people that we\\x92ve created \\r\\n\\t\\tinside the State Department knew that there was a lot of communication \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing on about demonstrations and sharing information on Twitter, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthat totally unconnected to what was going on in Iran, Twitter had \\r\\n\\t\\tplanned some kind of lapse in service to do something on their system -- \\r\\n\\t\\tyou can tell I have no idea what they were doing. I mean, \\r\\n\\t\\tyou know, I don\\x92t know Twitter from Tweeter, so to be \\r\\n\\t\\thonest with you. So these young tech people in the State Department called Twitter and \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid don\\x92t take Twitter down right now. Whatever you\\x92re going to do to \\r\\n\\t\\treboot or whatever it is, don\\x92t take Twitter down because \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople in Iran are dependent upon Twitter. So we have done that careful \\r\\n\\t\\tbalancing. Now, clearly, we think that pursuing an agenda of nonproliferation is a \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights issue. I mean, what would be worse than nuclear material or \\r\\n\\t\\teven a nuclear weapon being in the hands of either a state or a \\r\\n\\t\\tnon-state actor that would be used to intimidate and threaten and even, \\r\\n\\t\\tin the worst-case scenario, destroy? So we see a continuum. So pursuing what we think is in the national \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity interest not only of the United States but countries in Europe \\r\\n\\t\\tand in the Middle East is also a human rights issue. So we do not want \\r\\n\\t\\tto be in an either/or position: Are we going to pursue nonproliferation \\r\\n\\t\\twith Iran or are we going to support the demonstrators inside Iran? \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92re going to do both to the best of our ability to get a result that \\r\\n\\t\\twill further the cause we are seeking to support. Moderator:One final question in the back. Right there, with the red. \\r\\n\\t\\tRight. Christmas red. Question:Thank you. I am wondering what you see the role of artists \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing in helping to promote human rights. I had the privilege earlier \\r\\n\\t\\tthis summer to hear the playwright Lynn Nottage speak in one of the \\r\\n\\t\\tSenate buildings after she advocated for women\\x92s rights in the Congo, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I wonder how you see creative practice accompanying and amplifying \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicy. Secretary Clinton:That is a wonderful question because I think the arts \\r\\n\\t\\tand artists are one of our most effective tools in reaching beyond and \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough repressive regimes, in giving hope to people. It was a very \\r\\n\\t\\teffective tool during the Cold War. I\\x92ve had so many Eastern Europeans \\r\\n\\t\\ttell me that it was American music, it was American literature, it was \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican poetry that kept them going. I remember when Vaclav Havel came \\r\\n\\t\\tto the White House during my husband\\x92s administration, and we were \\r\\n\\t\\thaving a state dinner for him. And I said, \\x93Well, who would you like to \\r\\n\\t\\tentertain at the state dinner?\\x94 And I didn\\x92t know what he was going to \\r\\n\\t\\tsay. And he said, \\x93Lou Reed.\\x94 \\x93It was his music that was \\r\\n\\t\\tjust so important for us -- in prison, out of prison.\\x94 Well, you could name many other American artists who have traveled. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92re going to try to increase the number of artistic exchanges we do so \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we can get people into settings where they will be able to directly \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunicate. Now, with communication being what it is today, you can \\r\\n\\t\\tdownload them and all the rest, but there\\x92s something about the American \\r\\n\\t\\tGovernment sending somebody to make that case which I think is very \\r\\n\\t\\timportant to our commitment. Also, artists can bright to light in a gripping, dramatic way some of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe challenges we face. You mentioned the play about women in the Congo. \\r\\n\\t\\tI remember some years ago seeing a play about women in Bosnia during the \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict there. It was so gripping. I still see the faces of those women \\r\\n\\t\\twho were pulled from their homes, separated from their husbands, often \\r\\n\\t\\traped and left just as garbage on the side of the road. So I think that \\r\\n\\t\\tartists both individually and through their works can illustrate better \\r\\n\\t\\tthan any speech I can give or any government policy we can promulgate \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the spirit that lives within each of us, the right to think and \\r\\n\\t\\tdream and expand our boundaries, is not confined, no matter how hard \\r\\n\\t\\tthey try, by any regime anywhere in the world. There is no way that you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan deprive people from feeling those stirrings inside their soul. And \\r\\n\\t\\tartists can give voice to that. They can give shape and movement to it. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd it is so important in places where people feel forgotten and \\r\\n\\t\\tmarginalized and depressed and hopeless to have that glimmer that there \\r\\n\\t\\tis a better future, that there is a better way that they just have to \\r\\n\\t\\thold onto. So I\\x92m going to do what I can to continue to increase and enhance our \\r\\n\\t\\tartistic outreach, but this is also a great area for private \\r\\n\\t\\tfoundations, for NGOs, for artists themselves, for universities like \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorgetown to be engaged in. It\\x92s interesting, in today\\x92s world we are \\r\\n\\t\\tdeluged with so much information. I mean, we are living in information \\r\\n\\t\\toverload time. And so we need ways of cutting through all of that. We\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\talso living in an on-the-one-hand-this and on-another-hand-that sort of \\r\\n\\t\\tmedia environment. I always joke that if a television station or a \\r\\n\\t\\tnewspaper interviews somebody who is claiming that the earth is round, \\r\\n\\t\\tthey have to put on somebody from the Flat Earth Society because that\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tbalance, fair and balanced coverage. And so part of what we have to do is look for those ways of breaking \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough all of that. And I think that the power of the arts to do that \\r\\n\\t\\tis so enormous, and we can\\x92t ever forget about the role that it must \\r\\n\\t\\tplay in giving life to the aspirations of people around the world. Thank you all very much.\",\n",
       " \"Good evening. I\\x92m just returning from the White House, where I met with the President and the national security team, and I want to give you an update on the international community\\x92s efforts to implement UN Security CouncilResolutions 1970and1973, and protect the civilians of Libya. Events have moved very quickly, so let\\x92s be clear about where we stand and how we got here. When the Libyan people sought to realize their democratic aspirations, they were met by extreme violence from their own government. The Libyan people appealed to the world to help stop the brutal attacks on them, and the world listened. The Arab League called for urgent action. In response, the UN Security Council mandated all necessary measures to protect civilians, including a no-fly zone. But the regime\\x92s forces continued their assaults, and last weekend they reached Benghazi itself. We faced the prospect of an imminent humanitarian disaster. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were in danger. So an international coalition was compelled to act. French planes were the first to reach the skies over Benghazi. Cruise missiles from the United States and the United Kingdom followed, striking the region -- the regime\\x92s air defenses and clearing the way for allied aircraft to implement the no-fly zone. Many other nations have now joined this effort. After only five days, we have made significant progress. A massacre in Benghazi was prevented. Gaddafi's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective, and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya. Humanitarian relief is beginning to reach the people who need it. For example, just today we learned that at least 18 doctors and nurses from an organization funded by theUnited States Agency for International Developmenthad arrived in Benghazi and were beginning to provide support to the city\\x92s main hospital. Gaddafi's troops have been pushed back but they remain a serious threat to the safety of the people. From the start, President Obama has stressed that the role of the U.S. military would be limited in time and scope. Our mission has been to use America\\x92s unique capabilities to create the conditions for the no-fly zone and to assist in meeting urgent humanitarian needs. And as expected, we\\x92re already seeing a significant reduction in the number of U.S. planes involved in operations as the number of planes from other countries increase in numbers. Today we are taking the next step. We have agreed, along with our NATO allies, to transition command and control for the no-fly zone over Libya to NATO. All 28 allies have also now authorized military authorities to develop an operations plan for NATO to take on the broader civilian protection mission under Resolution 1973. NATO is well-suited to coordinating this international effort and ensuring that all participating nations are working effectively together toward our shared goals. This coalition includes countries beyond NATO, including Arab partners, and we expect all of them to be providing important political guidance going forward. We have always said that Arab leadership and participation is crucial. The Arab League showed that leadership with its pivotal statement on Libya. They joined the discussions in Paris last weekend on implementation, and we are deeply appreciative of their continuing contributions, including aircrafts and pilots from Qatar. This evening, the United Arab Emirates announced they are joining the coalition and sending planes to help protect Libyan civilians and enforce the no-fly zone. We welcome this important step. It underscores both the breadth of this international coalition and the depth of concern in the region for the plight of the Libyan people. In the days ahead, as NATO assumes command and control responsibilities, the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern. This operation has already saved many lives, but the danger is far from over. As long as the Gaddafi regime threatens its people and defies the United Nations, we must remain vigilant and focused. To continue coordinating with our partners and charting the way forward, I will travel to London to attend an international conference on Tuesday, convened by the United Kingdom. Our military will continue to provide support to our efforts to make sure that Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 will be enforced. This is an important effort that has garnered the support and the active participation of nations who recognize the significance of coming together in the international community, through the United Nations, to set forth a clear statement of action to be taken in order to protect innocent civilians from their own government. It is an effort that we believe is very important, and we\\x92ll look forward to coordinating closely with all those nations that are participating. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " ' Governor \\r\\nRichards, Chairman Brown, Mayor Dinkins, our great host, my fellow delegates and \\r\\nmy fellow Americans: I am so proud of Al Gore. He said he \\r\\ncame here tonight because he always wanted to do the warm-up for Elvis. Well, I \\r\\nran for President this year for one reason and one reason only: I wanted to come \\r\\nback to this convention and finish that speech I started four years ago. Well, last night \\r\\nMario Cuomo taught us how a real nominating speech should be given. He also made \\r\\nit clear why we have to steer our ship of state on a new course. Tonight I want \\r\\nto talk with you about my hope for the future, my faith in the American people, \\r\\nand my vision of the kind of country we can build together. I salute \\r\\nthe good men who were my companions on the campaign trial: Tom Harkin, Bob \\r\\nKerrey, Doug Wilder, Jerry Brown, and Paul Tsongas! One \\r\\nsentence in the Platform we built says it all: The most important family policy, \\r\\nurban policy, labor policy, minority policy, and foreign policy America can have \\r\\nis an expanding entrepreneurial economy of high-wage, high-skilled jobs. And so, in \\r\\nthe name of all those who do the work, pay the taxes, raise the kids, and \\r\\nplay by the rules, in the name of the hardworking Americans who make up our \\r\\nforgotten middle class, I proudly accept your nomination for President of the \\r\\nUnited States. I am a \\r\\nproduct of that middle class, and when I am President, you will be forgotten no \\r\\nmore. We meet at \\r\\na special moment in history, you and I. The Cold War is over. Soviet communism \\r\\nhas collapsed and our values -- freedom, democracy, individual rights, free \\r\\nenterprise -- they have triumphed all around the world. And yet, just as we have \\r\\nwon the Cold War abroad, we are losing the battles for economic opportunity and \\r\\nsocial justice here at home. Now that \\r\\nwe have changed the world, it\\x92s time to change America. I have \\r\\nnews for the forces of greed and the defenders of the status quo: Your time has \\r\\ncome and gone. Its time for a change in America. Tonight 10 \\r\\nmillion of our fellow Americans are out of work. Tens of millions more work \\r\\nharder for lower pay. The incumbent President says unemployment always goes up a \\r\\nlittle before a recovery begins, but unemployment only has to go up by one more \\r\\nperson before a real recovery can begin. And Mr. President, you are that man. This \\r\\nelection is about putting power back in your hands and putting the government back \\r\\non your side. It\\x92s about putting people first. You know, \\r\\nI\\x92ve said that all across the country. And whenever I do, someone always comes \\r\\nback at me, as a young man did just this week at a town meeting at the Henry \\r\\nStreet Settlement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He said, \\r\\n\\x93That sounds good, Bill, but you\\x92re a politician. Why should I trust you?\\x94 Tonight, \\r\\nas plainly as I can, I want to tell you who I am, what I believe, and where I \\r\\nwant to lead America. I never \\r\\nmet my father. He was killed in a car wreck on a rainy road three months before \\r\\nI was born, driving from Chicago to Arkansas to see my mother. After \\r\\nthat, my mother had to support us, so we lived with my grandparents while she \\r\\nwent back to Louisiana to study nursing. I can still see her clearly tonight \\r\\nthrough the eyes of a three-year-old, kneeling at the railroad station and \\r\\nweeping as she put me back on the train to Arkansas with my grandmother. She \\r\\nendured that pain because she knew her sacrifice was the only way she could \\r\\nsupport me and give me a better life. My mother taught me. She taught me about \\r\\nfamily and hard work and sacrifice. She held steady through tragedy after \\r\\ntragedy, and she held our family -- my brother and I -- together through tough \\r\\ntimes. As a \\r\\nchild, I watched her go off work each day at a time when it wasn\\x92t always easy \\r\\nto be a working mother. As an \\r\\nadult, I\\x92ve watched her fight off breast cancer, and again she has taught me a \\r\\nlesson in courage. And always, always, she taught me to fight. That\\x92s why \\r\\nI\\x92ll fight to create high-paying jobs so that parents can afford to raise their \\r\\nchildren today. That\\x92s why \\r\\nI\\x92m so committed to make sure every American gets the health care that saved my \\r\\nmother\\x92s life and that women\\x92s health care gets the same attention as men\\x92s. That\\x92s why \\r\\nI\\x92ll fight to make sure women in this country receive respect and dignity, \\r\\nwhether they work in the home, out of the home, or both. You want \\r\\nto know where I get my fighting spirit? It all started with my mother. Thank \\r\\nyou, Mother. I love you. When I \\r\\nthink about opportunity for all Americans, I think about my grandfather. He ran \\r\\na country store in our little town of Hope. There were no food stamps back then, \\r\\nso when his customers, whether they were white or black, who worked hard and did \\r\\nthe best they could, came in with no money, well, he gave them food anyway. Just made a note of it. So did I. Before I \\r\\nwas big enough to see over the counter, I learned from him to look up to people \\r\\nother folks looked down on. My \\r\\ngrandfather just had a high school education -- a grade school education -- but in \\r\\nthat country store he taught me more about equality in the eyes of the Lord than \\r\\nall my professors at Georgetown, more about the intrinsic worth of every \\r\\nindividual than all the philosophers at Oxford, more about the need for equal \\r\\njustice under the law than all the jurists at Yale Law School. If you \\r\\nwant to know where I come by the passionate commitment I have to bringing people \\r\\ntogether without regard to race, it all started with my grandfather. I learned \\r\\na lot from another person, too, a person who for more than 20 years has worked \\r\\nhard to help our children, paying the price of time to make sure our schools \\r\\ndon\\x92t fail them; someone who traveled our state for a year, studying, learning, \\r\\nlistening, going to PTA meetings, school board meetings, town hall meetings, \\r\\nputting together a package of school reforms recognized around the nation -- doing it all while building a distinguished legal career and being a wonderful, \\r\\nloving mother. That \\r\\nperson is my wife. Hillary \\r\\ntaught me. She taught me that all children can learn and that each of us has a \\r\\nduty to help them do it. So if you \\r\\nwant to know why I care so much about our children, and our future, it all \\r\\nstarted with Hillary. I love you. Frankly, I\\'m fed up with politicians in Washington lecturing the rest of us about family \\r\\nvalues. Our families have values. But our government doesn\\x92t. I want an \\r\\nAmerica where family values live in our actions, not just in our speeches, an \\r\\nAmerica that includes every family, every traditional family and every extended \\r\\nfamily, every two parent family, every single-parent family and every foster \\r\\nfamily -- every family. I do want \\r\\nto say something to the fathers in this country who have chosen to abandon their \\r\\nchildren by neglecting their child support: Take responsibility for your \\r\\nchildren or we will force you to do so. Because governments don\\x92t raise \\r\\nchildren; parents do. And you should. And I want \\r\\nto say something to every child in America tonight who is out there trying to \\r\\ngrow up without a father or a mother: I know how you feel. You\\'re special too. You matter \\r\\nto America. And don\\x92t you ever let anybody tell you you can\\x92t become whatever you \\r\\nwant to be. And, if other politicians make you feel like you are not part of \\r\\ntheir family, come on and be part of ours. The thing \\r\\nthat makes me angriest about what\\'s gone wrong in the last 12 years is that \\r\\nour government has lost touch with our values, while our politicians continue to \\r\\nshout about them. I\\x92m tired of it! I was \\r\\nraised to believe the American Dream was built on rewarding hard work. But we \\r\\nhave seen the folks of Washington turn the American ethic on its head. For too \\r\\nlong those who play by the rules and keep the faith have gotten the shaft, and \\r\\nthose who cut corners and cut deals have been rewarded. People are \\r\\nworking harder than ever, spending less time with their children, working nights \\r\\nand weekends at their jobs instead of going to PTA and Little League or Scouts. \\r\\nAnd their incomes are still going down. Their taxes are still going up. And the \\r\\ncosts of health care, housing, and education are going through the roof. Meanwhile, \\r\\nmore and more of our best people are falling into poverty even though they work \\r\\n40 hours a week. Our people \\r\\nare pleading for change, but government is in the way. It\\'s been hijacked by \\r\\nprivileged private interests. It\\'s forgotten who really pays the bills around \\r\\nhere. It\\'s taken more of your money and given you less in return. We have got \\r\\nto go beyond the brain-dead politics in Washington and give our people the kind \\r\\nof government they deserve, a government that works for them. A \\r\\nPresident ought to be a powerful force for progress. But right now \\r\\nI know how President Lincoln felt when General McClellan wouldn\\x92t attack in the \\r\\nCivil War. He asked him, \\x93If you\\x92re not going to use your army, may I borrow \\r\\nit?\\x94 And so I \\r\\nsay: George Bush, if you won\\x92t use your power to help America, step aside -- I \\r\\nwill. Our \\r\\ncountry is falling behind. The President is caught in the grip of a failed \\r\\neconomic theory. We have gone from 1st to 13th in the world in wages since \\r\\nReagan and Bush have been in office. Four years \\r\\nago, candidate Bush said, \\x93America is a special place, not just another pleasant \\r\\ncountry somewhere on the UN roll call between Albania and Zimbabwe.\\x94 Now, under \\r\\nPresident Bush America has an unpleasant economy struck somewhere between \\r\\nGermany and Sri Lanka. And for \\r\\nmost Americans, Mr. President, life\\x92s a lot less kind and a lot less gentle than \\r\\nit was before your administration took office. Listen...yell \\r\\nit some more. [to audience chanting \"No second term\"] Our \\r\\ncountry has fallen so far so fast that just a few months ago the Japanese Prime \\r\\nMinister actually said he felt sympathy for the United States. \"Sympathy.\" When I \\r\\nam your President, the rest -- the rest of the world will not look down on us \\r\\nwith pity, but up to us with respect again. What is \\r\\nGeorge Bush doing about our economic problems? Now, four \\r\\nyears ago he promised 15 million new jobs by this time, and he\\x92s over 14 million \\r\\nshort. Al Gore and I can do better. He has \\r\\nraised taxes on the people driving pickup trucks and lowered taxes on the people \\r\\nriding in limousines. We can do better. He \\r\\npromised to balance the budget, but he hasn\\x92t even tried. In fact, the budgets \\r\\nhe has submitted to Congress nearly doubled the debt. Even worse, he wasted \\r\\nbillions and reduced our investments in education and jobs. We can do better. So, if you \\r\\nare sick and tired of a government that doesn\\x92t work to create jobs, if you\\x92re \\r\\nsick and tired of a tax system that\\x92s stacked against you, if you\\x92re sick and \\r\\ntired of exploding debt and reduced investments in our future, or if, like the \\r\\ngreat civil rights pioneer Fannie Lou Hamer, you\\x92re just plain old sick and \\r\\ntired of being sick and tired, then join us; work with us; win with us, and we \\r\\ncan make our country the country it was meant to be. Now, \\r\\nGeorge Bush talks a good game, but he has no game plan to rebuild America, from \\r\\nthe cities to the suburbs to the countryside, so that we can compete and win \\r\\nagain in the global economy. I do. He won\\x92t \\r\\ntake on the big insurance companies and the bureaucracies to control health \\r\\ncosts and give us affordable health care for all Americans, but I will. He won\\x92t \\r\\neven implement the recommendations of his own commission on AIDS, but I will. He won\\x92t \\r\\nstreamline the federal government and change the way it works, cut 100,000 \\r\\nbureaucrats and put 100,000 new police officers on the streets of American \\r\\ncities, but I will. He\\x92s never \\r\\nbalanced a government budget, but I have 11 times. He won\\x92t \\r\\nbreak the stranglehold the special interests have on our elections and the \\r\\nlobbyists have on our government, but I will. He won\\x92t \\r\\ngive mothers and fathers the simple chance to take some time off from work when \\r\\na baby is born or a parent is sick, but I will. We\\x92re \\r\\nlosing our farms at a rapid rate, and he has no commitment to keep family farms \\r\\nin the family, but I do. He\\x92s \\r\\ntalked a lot about drugs, but he hasn\\x92t helped people on the front line to wage \\r\\nthat war on drugs and crime. But I will. He won\\x92t \\r\\ntake the lead in protecting the environment and creating new jobs in \\r\\nenvironmental technologies for the 21st century, but I will. And you know what \\r\\nelse? He doesn\\x92t have Al Gore, and I do. Just in \\r\\ncase -- Just in case, you didn\\x92t notice, that\\x92s \"Gore\" with an \"e\" on the end. And George \\r\\nBush -- George Bush won\\x92t guarantee a women\\x92s right to choose; I will. Hear me, \\r\\nnow: I am not pro-abortion; I am pro-choice, strongly. I believe this difficult \\r\\nand painful decision should be left to the women of America. I hope the \\r\\nright to privacy can be protected and we will never again have to discuss this \\r\\nissue on political platforms. But I am old enough to remember what it was like \\r\\nbefore Roe v. Wade, and I do not want to return to the time when we made \\r\\ncriminals of women and their doctors. Jobs, \\r\\neducation, health care -- these are not just commitments from my lips; they are \\r\\nthe work of my life. Our \\r\\npriorities must be clear; we will put our people first again. But priorities \\r\\nwithout a clear plan of action are just empty words. To turn our rhetoric into \\r\\nreality we\\x92ve got to change the way government does business, fundamentally. \\r\\nUntil we do, we\\x92ll continue to pour billions of dollars down the drain. The \\r\\nRepublicans have campaigned against big government for a generation. But have \\r\\nyou noticed, they\\x92ve run this big government for a generation? And they haven\\x92t \\r\\nchanged a thing. They don\\x92t want to fix government; they still want to campaign \\r\\nagainst it, and that\\x92s all. But, my \\r\\nfellow Democrats, its time for us to realize that we\\x92ve got some changing to do too. \\r\\nThere is not a program in government for every problem, and if we want to use \\r\\ngovernment to help people, we have got to make it work again. Because we \\r\\nare committed in this convention and in this platform to making these changes, \\r\\nwe are, as Democrats, in the words that Ross Perot himself spoke today, \\x93a \\r\\nrevitalized Democratic Party.\\x94 I am well \\r\\naware that all those millions of people who rallied to Ross Perot\\x92s cause wanted \\r\\nto be in an army of patriots for change. Tonight, I say to them: \"Join us, and \\r\\ntogether we will revitalize America.\" Now, I \\r\\ndon\\x92t have all the answers, but I do know the old ways don\\x92t work. Trickle down \\r\\neconomics has sure failed. And big bureaucracies, both private and public, \\r\\nthey\\x92ve failed too. That\\x92s why \\r\\nwe need a new approach to government, a government that offers more empowerment \\r\\nand less entitlement, more choices for young people in the schools they attend -- \\r\\nin the public schools they attend. And more choices for the elderly and for \\r\\npeople with disabilities and the long-term care they receive. A government that \\r\\nis leaner, not meaner; a government that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy; a \\r\\ngovernment that understands that jobs must come from growth in a vibrant and \\r\\nvital system of free enterprise. I call \\r\\nthis approach a \"New Covenant,\" a solemn agreement between the people and their \\r\\ngovernment based not simply on what each of us can take but what all of us must \\r\\ngive to our nation. We offer \\r\\nour people a new choice based on old values. We offer opportunity. We demand \\r\\nresponsibility. We will build an American community again. The choice we offer \\r\\nis not conservative or liberal. In many ways, it\\'s not even Republican or \\r\\nDemocratic. It\\'s different. It\\'s new. And it will work. It will work because \\r\\nit is rooted in the vision and the values of the American people. Of all the \\r\\nthings George Bush has ever said that I disagree with, perhaps the thing \\r\\nthat bothers me most, is how he derides and degrades the American tradition of \\r\\nseeing and seeking a better future. He mocks it as the \\x93vision thing.\\x94 But just \\r\\nremember what the Scripture says: \\x93Where there is no vision, the people perish.\\x94 I hope -- I \\r\\nhope nobody in this great hall tonight, or in our beloved country has to go \\r\\nthrough tomorrow without a vision. I hope no one ever tries to raise a child \\r\\nwithout a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the \\r\\nground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish. One of the \\r\\nreasons we have so many children in so much trouble in so many places in this \\r\\nnation is because they have seen so little opportunity, so little \\r\\nresponsibility, so little loving, caring community, that they literally cannot \\r\\nimagine the life we are calling them to lead. And so I \\r\\nsay again: Where there is no vision, America will perish. What is the vision of \\r\\nour New Covenant? An America \\r\\nwith millions of new jobs and dozens of new industries, moving confidently \\r\\ntoward the 21st century. An America \\r\\nthat says to entrepreneurs and businesspeople: We will give you more incentives \\r\\nand more opportunity than ever before to develop the skills of your workers and \\r\\nto create American jobs and American wealth in the new global economy. But you \\r\\nmust do your part; you must be responsible. American companies must act like \\r\\nAmerican companies again, exporting products, not jobs. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhat this New Covenant\\'s all about. An America \\r\\nin which the doors of colleges are thrown open once again to the sons and \\r\\ndaughters of stenographers and steelworkers. We\\'ll say: Everybody can borrow \\r\\nthe money to go to college. But you must do your part. You must pay it back from \\r\\nyour paychecks or, better yet, by going back home and serving your communities. Just think \\r\\nof it. Think of it. Millions of energetic young men and women serving their \\r\\ncountry by policing the streets or teaching the children or caring for the sick; \\r\\nor working with the elderly and people with disabilities; or helping young \\r\\npeople to stay off drugs and out of gangs, giving us all a sense of new hope and \\r\\nlimitless possibilities. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhat this New Covenant is all about. An America \\r\\nin which health care is a right, not a privilege, in which we say to all of our \\r\\npeople: \\x93Your government has the courage finally to take on the health care \\r\\nprofiteers and make health care affordable for every family.\\x94 But, you must do \\r\\nyour part -- preventive care, prenatal care, childhood immunization, saving lives, \\r\\nsaving money, saving families from heartbreak. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhat the New Covenant is all about. An America \\r\\nin which middle-class incomes, not middle-class taxes, are going up. An \\r\\nAmerica, yes, in which the wealthiest few, those making over $200,000 a year, \\r\\nare asked to pay their fair share. An America \\r\\nin which the rich are not soaked, but the middle class is not drowned, either. Responsibility starts at the top. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhat the New Covenant is all about. An America \\r\\nwhere we end welfare as we know it. We will say to those on welfare: You will \\r\\nhave and you deserve the opportunity through training and education, through \\r\\nchild care and medical coverage, to liberate yourself. But then, when you can, \\r\\nyou must work, because welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhat the New Covenant is all about. An America \\r\\nwith the world\\x92s strongest defense, ready and willing to use force when \\r\\nnecessary. An America \\r\\nat the forefront of the global effort to preserve and protect our common \\r\\nenvironment -- and promoting global growth. An America \\r\\nthat will not coddle tyrants, from Baghdad to Beijing. An America \\r\\nthat champions the cause of freedom and democracy from Eastern Europe to \\r\\nSouthern Africa -- and in our own hemisphere, in Haiti and Cuba. The end of \\r\\nthe Cold War permits us to reduce defense spending while still maintaining the \\r\\nstrongest defense in the world, but we must plow back every dollar of defense \\r\\ncuts into building American jobs right here at home. I know well that the world \\r\\nneeds a strong America, but we have learned that strength begins at home. But the \\r\\nNew Covenant is about more than opportunities and responsibilities for you and \\r\\nyour families. It\\x92s also about our common community. Tonight, \\r\\nevery one of you knows deep in your heart that we are too divided. It is time to \\r\\nheal America. And so we \\r\\nmust say to every American: Look beyond the stereotypes that blind us. We need \\r\\neach other --- all of us -- we need each other. We don\\x92t have a person to waste, \\r\\nand yet for too long politicians have told the most of us that are doing all \\r\\nright that what\\x92s really wrong with America is the rest of us -- \"them.\" Them -- the \\r\\nminorities. Them -- the liberals. Them -- the poor. Them -- the homeless. Them \\r\\n-- the \\r\\npeople with disabilities. Them -- the gays. We\\x92ve \\r\\ngotten to where we\\x92ve nearly \"them\\'ed\" ourselves to death: Them, and them, and \\r\\nthem. But, this \\r\\nis America. There is no \"them.\" There is only \"us.\" One \\r\\nnation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. That -- \\r\\nThat, is ourPledge of Allegiance, and that\\x92s what the New Covenant is all \\r\\nabout. How do I \\r\\nknow we can come together and make change happen? Because I have seen it in my \\r\\nown state. In Arkansas, we are working together, and we\\'re making progress. No, \\r\\nthere\\x92s no Arkansas miracle, but there are a lot of miraculous people. And \\r\\nbecause of them, our schools are better, our wages are higher, our factories \\r\\nare busier, our water is cleaner, and our budget is balanced. We\\x92re moving ahead. I wish \\r\\n-- I wish I \\r\\ncould say the same thing about America under the incumbent President. He took \\r\\nthe richest country in the world and brought it down. We took on \\r\\nof the poorest states in America and lifted it up. And so I \\r\\nsay to all of those in this campaign season who would criticize Arkansas, come \\r\\non down -- especially -- especially if you\\x92re from Washington, come on down. Sure, \\r\\nyou\\x92ll see us struggling against some of the problems we haven\\x92t solved \\r\\nyet, but you\\x92ll also see a lot of great people doing amazing things, and you \\r\\nmight even learn a thing or two. In the \\r\\nend, my fellow Americans, this New Covenant\\xa0simply asks us all to be Americans \\r\\nagain -- old-fashioned Americans for a new time: Opportunity, responsibility, \\r\\ncommunity. When we \\r\\npull together, America will pull ahead. Throughout the whole history of this \\r\\ncountry, we have seen time and time and time again, when we are united we are \\r\\nunstoppable. We can \\r\\nseize this moment, make it exciting and energizing and heroic to be American \\r\\nagain. We can renew our faith in each other and in ourselves. We can restore our \\r\\nsense of unity and community. As the \\r\\nScripture says, \"our eyes have not yet seen, nor our ears heard, nor our minds \\r\\nimagined\" what we can build.1 But I \\r\\ncan\\x92t do this alone -- no President can. We must do it together. It won\\x92t be easy \\r\\nand it won\\x92t be quick. We didn\\x92t get into this mess overnight, and we won\\x92t get \\r\\nout of it overnight. But we can do it -- with commitment, creativity, diversity, \\r\\nand drive! We can do \\r\\nit! We can do it! We can do \\r\\nit! We can do it! We can do it! We can do \\r\\nit! We can do it! I want \\r\\nevery person in this hall and every person in this land to reach out and join us \\r\\nin a great new adventure, to chart a bold new future. As a \\r\\nteenager, I heard John Kennedy\\x92s summons to citizenship. And then, as a student \\r\\nat Georgetown I head that call clarified by a professor namedCarol Quigley, who \\r\\nsaid to us that America was the greatest nation in history because our people \\r\\nhad always believed in two things: that tomorrow can be better than today and \\r\\nthat every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so. That -- \\r\\nThat kind of future entered my life the night our daughter, Chelsea, was born. \\r\\nAs I stood in the delivery room, I was overcome with the thought that God had \\r\\ngiven me a blessing my own father never knew -- the chance to hold my child in my \\r\\narms. Somewhere \\r\\nat this very moment a child is being born in America. Let it be our cause to \\r\\ngive that child a happy home, a healthy family, and a hopeful future. Let it be \\r\\nour cause to see that that child has a chance to live to the fullest of her \\r\\nGod-given capacities. Let it \\r\\n-- Let it be \\r\\nour cause to see that child grow up strong and secure, braced by her challenges \\r\\nbut never struggling alone, with family and friends and a faith that, in America, \\r\\nno one is left out; no one is left behind. Let it be \\r\\n-- Let it be our cause that when this child is able, she gives something back to \\r\\nher children, her community, and her country. Let it be our cause that we give \\r\\nthis child a country that is coming together, not coming apart, a country of \\r\\nboundless hopes and endless dreams, a country once again lifts its people and \\r\\ninspires the world. Let that be our cause our commitment and our New Covenant. My fellow \\r\\nAmericans, I end tonight where it all began for me. I still believe in a place \\r\\ncalled Hope. God bless you, and God Bless America.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Mayor, fellow Democrats, we are here to nominate a President. And I\\x92ve got one in mind. I want to nominate a man whose own life has known its fair share of adversity and uncertainty. I want to nominate a man who ran for President to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before his election, saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression; a man who stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery, knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs that he saved or created, there would still be millions more waiting, worried about feeding their own kids, trying to keep their hopes alive. I want to nominate a man who\\x92s cool on the outside -- but who burns for America on the inside. I want -- I want a man who believes with no doubt that we can build a new American Dream economy, driven by innovation and creativity, but education and -- yes -- by cooperation. And by the way, after last night, I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama. You know -- I want -- I want Barack Obama to be the next President of the United States. And I proudly nominate him to be the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party. Now, folks, in Tampa a few days ago, we heard a lot of talk all about how the President and the Democrats don\\x92t really believe in free enterprise and individual initiative, how we want everybody to be dependent on the government, how bad we are for the economy. This Republican narrative, this alternative universe, says that every one of us in this room who amounts to anything, we\\x92re all completely self-made. One of the greatest chairmen the Democratic Party ever had,Bob Strauss, used to say that every politician wants every voter to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself. But, as Strauss then admitted, it ain\\x92t so. We Democrats, we think the country works better with a strong middle class, with real opportunities for poor folks to work their way into it with a relentless focus on the future, with business and government actually working together to promote growth and broadly share prosperity. You see, we believe that \\x93we\\x92re all in this together\\x94 is a far better philosophy than \\x93you\\x92re on your own.\\x94 It is. So, who\\x92s right? Well, since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats, 24. In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private sector jobs. So, what\\x92s the job score? Republicans, 24 million; Democrats, 42 [million]. Now, there\\x92s -- there\\x92s a reason for this. It turns out that advancing equal opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics. Why? Because poverty, discrimination and ignorance restrict growth. When you stifle human potential, when you don\\x92t invest in new ideas, it doesn\\x92t just cut off the people who are affected; it hurts us all. We know that investments in education and infrastructure and scientific and technological research increase growth. They increase good jobs, and they create new wealth for all the rest of us. Now, there\\x92s something I\\x92ve noticed lately. You probably have too. And it\\x92s this. Maybe just because I grew up in a different time, but though I often disagree with Republicans, I actually never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate our President and a lot of other Democrats. I -- that would be impossible for me because President Eisenhower sent federal troops to my home state to integrate Little Rock Central High School. President Eisenhower built the interstate highway system. When I was a governor, I worked with President Reagan and his White House on the first round of welfare reform and with President George H.W. Bush on national education goals. I\\x92m actually very grateful to -- If you saw from the film what I do today, I have to be grateful, and you should be, too -- that President George W. Bush supportedPEPFAR. It saved the lives of millions of people in poor countries. And I have been honored to work with both Presidents Bush on natural disasters in the aftermath of the South Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the horrible earthquake in Haiti. Through my foundation, both in America and around the world, I\\x92m working all the time with Democrats, Republicans and independents. Sometimes I couldn\\x92t tell you for the life who I\\x92m working with because we focus on solving problems and seizing opportunities and not fighting all the time. And so here\\x92s what I want to say to you, and here\\x92s what I want the people at home to think about. When times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain, the politics of constant conflict may be good. But what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world. What works in the real world is cooperation. What works in the real world is cooperation, business and government, foundations and universities. Ask the mayors who are here. Los Angeles is getting green and Chicago is getting an infrastructure bank because Republicans and Democrats are working together to get it. They didn\\x92t check their brains at the door. They didn\\x92t stop disagreeing, but their purpose was to get something done. Now, why is this true? Why does cooperation work better than constant conflict? Because nobody\\x92s right all the time, and a broken clock is right twice a day. And every one of us -- every one of us and every one of them, we\\x92re compelled to spend our fleeting lives between those two extremes, knowing we\\x92re never going to be right all the time and hoping we\\x92re right more than twice a day. Unfortunately, the faction that now dominates the Republican Party doesn\\x92t see it that way. They think government is always the enemy, they\\x92re always right, and compromise is weakness. Just in the last couple of elections, they defeated two distinguished Republican senators because they dared to cooperate with Democrats on issues important to the future of the country, even national security. They beat a Republican congressman with almost a hundred percent voting record on every conservative score, because he said he realized he did not have to hate the President to disagree with him. Boy, that was a nonstarter, and they threw him out. One of the main reasons we ought to re-elect President Obama is that he is still committed to constructive cooperation. Look at his record. Look at his record. Look at his record. He appointed Republican secretaries of defense, the Army and transportation. He appointed a Vice President who ran against him in 2008. And he trusted that Vice President to oversee the successful end of the war in Iraq and the implementation of the recovery act. And Joe Biden -- Joe Biden did a great job with both. He -- President Obama -- President Obama appointed several members of his Cabinet even though they supported Hillary in the primary. Heck, he even appointed Hillary. Wait a minute. I am -- I am very proud of her. I am proud of the job she and the national security team have done for America. I am grateful that they have worked together to make us safer and stronger, to build a world with more partners and fewer enemies. I\\x92m grateful for the relationship of respect and partnership she and the President have enjoyed and the signal that sends to the rest of the world, that democracy does not have a blood -- have to be a blood sport, it can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest. Now besides the national security team, I am very grateful to the men and women who\\x92ve served our country in uniform through these perilous times. And I am especially grateful to Michelle Obama and to Joe Biden for supporting those military families while their loved ones were overseas and for supporting our veterans when they came home, when they came home bearing the wounds of war or needing help to find education or jobs or housing. President Obama\\x92s whole record on national security is a tribute to his strength, to his judgment and to his preference for inclusion and partnership over partisanship. We need more if it in Washington, D.C. Now, we all know that he also tried to work with congressional Republicans on health care, debt reduction and new jobs. And that didn\\x92t work out so well. But it could have been because, as the Senate Republican leader said in a remarkable moment of candor two full years before the election, their number one priority was not to put America back to work; it was to put the President out of work. Well, wait a minute. Senator, I hate to break it to you, but we\\x92re going to keep President Obama on the job. In Tampa -- In Tampa -- in Tampa -- did y\\x92all watch their convention? I did. In Tampa, the Republican argument against the President\\x92s re-election was actually pretty simple -- pretty snappy. It went something like this: We left him a total mess. He hasn\\x92t cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and put us back in. Now -- But they did it well. They looked good; the sounded good. They convinced me that they all love their families and their children and were grateful they\\x92d been born in America and all that -- really, I\\x92m not being -- they did. And this is important, they convinced me they were honorable people who believed what they said and they\\x92re going to keep every commitment they\\x92ve made. We just got to make sure the American people know what those commitments are because in order to look like an acceptable, reasonable, moderate alternative to President Obama, they just didn\\x92t say very much about the ideas they\\x92ve offered over the last two years. They couldn\\x92t because they want to the same old policies that got us in trouble in the first place. They want to cut taxes for high- income Americans, even more than President Bush did. They want to get rid of those pesky financial regulations designed to prevent another crash and prohibit future bailouts. They want to actually increase defense spending over a decade two trillion dollars more than the Pentagon has requested without saying what they\\x92ll spend it on. And they want to make enormous cuts in the rest of the budget, especially programs that help the middle class and poor children. As another President once said, there they go again. Now, I like -- I like -- I like the argument for President Obama\\x92s re-election a lot better. Here it is. He inherited a deeply damaged economy. He put a floor under the crash. He began the long, hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well- balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses and lots of new wealth for innovators. Now, are we where we want to be today? No. Is the President satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than we were when he took office? And listen to this. Listen to this. Everybody\\'s forgotten. Everybody\\'s forgotten. When President Barack Obama took office, the economy was in free fall. It had just shrunk 9 full percent of GDP. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes. Now, look. Here\\x92s the challenge he faces and the challenge all of you who support him face. I get it. I know it. I\\x92ve been there. A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy. If you look at the numbers, you know employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend again. And in a lot of places, housing prices are even beginning to pick up. But too many people do not feel it yet. I had the same thing happen in 1994 and early \\x9195. We could see that the policies were working, that the economy was growing. But most people didn\\x92t feel it yet. Thankfully, by 1996 the economy was roaring, everybody felt it, and we were halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in the history of the United States. But -- Wait, wait. The difference this time is purely in the circumstances. President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. Listen to me, now. No President -- No President, not me, not any of my predecessors, no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. Now -- But he has -- he has laid the foundation for a new, modern, successful economy of shared prosperity. And if you will renew the President\\x92s contract, you will feel it. You will feel it. Folks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it. Now, why do I believe it? I\\x92m fixing to tell you why. I believe it because President Obama\\x92s approach embodies the values, the ideas and the direction America has to take to build the 21st-century version of the American Dream: a nation of shared opportunities, shared responsibilities, shared prosperity, a shared sense of community. So let\\x92s get back to the story. In 2010, as the President\\x92s recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around. The recovery act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes. Let me say this again: Cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people. And, in the last 29 months, our economy has produced about four and a half million private sector jobs. We could have done better, but last year the Republicans blocked the President\\x92s job plan, costing the economy more than a million new jobs. So here\\x92s another job score. President Obama: plus four and a half million. Congressional Republicans: zero. During this period -- During this period, more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs have been created under President Obama. That\\x92s the first time manufacturing jobs have increased since the 1990s. And I\\x92ll tell you something else. The auto industry restructuring worked. It saved -- It saved more than a million jobs, and not just at GM, Chrysler and their dealerships but in auto parts manufacturing all over the country. That\\x92s why even the automakers who weren\\x92t part of the deal supported it. They needed to save those parts suppliers too. Like I said, we\\x92re all in this together. So what\\x92s happened? There are now 250,000 more people working in the auto industry than on the day the companies were restructured. So -- Now, we all know that Governor Romney opposed the plan to save GM and Chrysler. So here\\x92s another job score. Are you listening in Michigan and Ohio and across the country? Here -- Here\\x92s another job score: Obama, 250,000; Romney, 0. Now, the agreement the Administration made with the management, labor and environmental groups to double car mileage, that was a good deal too. It will cut your gas prices in half, your gas bill. No matter what the price is, if you double the mileage of your car, your bill will be half what it would have been. It will make us more energy independent. It will cut greenhouse gas emissions. And according to several analyses, over the next 20 years, it\\x92ll bring us another half a million good new jobs into the American economy. The President\\x92s energy strategy, which he calls \"all of the above,\" is helping too. The boom in oil and gas production, combined with greater energy efficiency, has driven oil imports to a near-20- year low and natural gas production to an all-time high. And renewable energy production has doubled. Of course, we need a lot more new jobs. But there are already more than 3 million jobs open and unfilled in America, mostly because the people who apply for them don\\x92t yet have the required skills to do them. So even as we get Americans more jobs, we have to prepare more Americans for the new jobs that are actually going to be created. The old economy is not coming back. We\\x92ve got to build a new one and educate people to do those jobs. The President -- The President and his education secretary have supported community colleges and employers in working together to train people for jobs that are actually open in their communities -- and even more important after a decade in which exploding college costs have increased the dropout rate so much that the percentage of our young people with four-year college degrees has gone down so much that we have dropped to 16th in the world in the percentage of young people with college degrees. So the President\\x92s student loan is more important than ever. Here\\x92s what it does. Here\\x92s what it does. You need to tell every voter where you live about this. It lowers the cost of federal student loans. And even more important, it give students the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years. Now what does this mean? What does this mean? Think of it. It means no one will ever have to drop out of college again for fear they can\\x92t repay their debt. And it means -- it means that if someone wants to take a job with a modest income, a teacher, a police officer, if they want to be a small-town doctor in a little rural area, they won\\x92t have to turn those jobs down because they don\\x92t pay enough to repay they debt. Their debt obligation will be determined by their salary. This will change the future for young America. I don\\x92t know about you but on all these issues, I know we\\x92re better off because President Obama made the decisions he did. Now, that brings me to health care. And the Republicans call it, derisively, \"Obamacare.\" They say it\\x92s a government takeover, a disaster, and that if we\\x92ll just elect them, they\\x92ll repeal it. Well, are they right? Let\\x92s take a look at what\\x92s actually happened so far. First, individuals and businesses have already gotten more than a billion dollars in refunds from insurance companies because the new law requires 80 to 85 percent of your premium to go to your health care, not profits or promotion. And the gains are even greater than that because a bunch of insurance companies have applied to lower their rates to comply with the requirement. Second, more than 3 million young people between 19 and 25 are insured for the first time because their parents\\x92 policies can cover them. Millions of seniors are receiving preventive care, all the way from breast cancer screenings to tests for heart problems and scores of other things. And younger people are getting them, too. Fourth, soon the insurance companies -- not the government, the insurance companies -- will have millions of new customers, many of them middle-class people with pre-existing conditions who never could get insurance before. Now, finally, listen to this. For the last two years -- after going up at three times the rate of inflation for a decade, for the last two years health care costs have been under 4 percent in both years for the first time in 50 years. So let me ask you something. Are we better off because President Obama fought for health care reform? You bet we are. Now, there were two other attacks on the President in Tampa I think deserve an answer. First, both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan attacked the President for allegedly robbing Medicare of 716 billion dollars. That\\x92s the same attack they leveled against the Congress in 2010, and they got a lot of votes on it. But it\\x92s not true. Look, here\\x92s what really happened. You be the judge. Here\\x92s what really happened. There were no cuts to benefits at all. None. What the President did was to save money by taking the recommendations of a commission of professionals to cut unwarranted subsidies to providers and insurance companies that were not making people healthier and were not necessary to get the providers to provide the service. And instead of raiding Medicare, he used the savings to close the doughnut hole in the Medicare drug program and you all got to listen carefully to this -- this is really important -- and to add eight years to the life of the Medicare trust fund so it is solvent till 2024. So -- So President Obama and the Democrats didn\\x92t weaken Medicare; they strengthened Medicare. Now, when Congressman Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama\\x92s Medicare savings as, quote, the biggest, coldest power play, I didn\\x92t know whether to laugh or cry because that 716 billion dollars is exactly, to the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings that he has in his own budget. You got to get one thing -- it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did. So, now you\\x92re having a good time, but this is getting serious, and I want you to listen. It\\x92s important, because a lot of people believe this stuff. Now, at least on this issue, on this one issue, Governor Romney has been consistent. He attacked President Obama too, but he actually wants to repeal those savings and give the money back to the insurance company. He wants to go back to the old system, which means we\\x92ll reopen the doughnut hole and force seniors to pay more for drugs, and we\\x92ll reduce the life of the Medicare trust fund by eight full years. So if he\\x92s elected, and if he does what he promised to do, Medicare will now [go] broke in 2016. Think about that. That means, after all, we won\\x92t have to wait until their voucher program kicks in 2023 to see the end of Medicare as we know it. They\\x92re going to do it to us sooner than we thought. Now, folks, this is serious, because it gets worse. And you won\\x92t be laughing when I finish telling you this. They also want to block-grant Medicaid, and cut it by a third over the coming 10 years. Of course, that\\x92s going to really hurt a lot of poor kids. But that\\x92s not all. Lot of folks don\\x92t know it, but nearly two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on nursing home care for Medicare seniors who are eligible for Medicaid. It\\x92s going to end Medicare as we know it. And a lot of that money is also spent to help people with disabilities, including a lot of middle-class families whose kids have Down\\x92s syndrome or autism or other severe conditions. And honestly, let\\x92s think about it, if that happens, I don\\x92t know what those families are going to do. So I know what I\\x92m going to do. I\\x92m going to do everything I can to see that it doesn\\x92t happen. We can\\x92t let it happen. We can\\x92t. Now, wait a minute. Let\\x92s look -- Let\\x92s look at the other big charge the Republicans made. It\\x92s a real doozy. They actually have charged and run ads saying that President Obama wants to weaken the work requirements in the welfare reform bill I signed that moved millions of people from welfare to work. Wait, you need to know, here\\x92s what happened. Nobody ever tells you what really happened. Here\\x92s what happened. When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama Administration listened because we all know it\\x92s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge. And the Administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now, did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less. So this is personal to me. We moved millions of people off welfare. It was one of the reasons that in the eight years I was President, we had a hundred times as many people move out of poverty into the middle class than happened under the previous 12 years, a hundred times as many. It\\x92s a big deal. But I am telling you the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform\\x92s work requirement is just not true. But they keep on running the ads claiming it. You want to know why? Their campaign pollster said, we are not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers. Now, finally I can say that is true. I -- I couldn\\x92t have said it better myself. And I hope you and every American within the sound of my voice remembers it every time they see one of those ads, and it turns into an ad to re-elect Barack Obama and keep the fundamental principles of personal empowerment and moving everybody who can get a job into work as soon as we can. Now, let\\x92s talk about the debt. Today, interest rates are low, lower than the rate of inflation. People are practically paying us to borrow money, to hold their money for them. But it will become a big problem when the economy grows and interest rates start to rise. We\\x92ve got to deal with this big long- term debt problem or it will deal with us. It will gobble up a bigger and bigger percentage of the federal budget we\\x92d rather spend on education and health care and science and technology. It -- We\\x92ve got to deal with it. Now, what has the President done? He has offered a reasonable plan of four trillion dollars in debt reduction over a decade, with two and a half trillion coming from -- for every two and a half trillion dollars in spending cuts, he raises a dollar in new revenues 2 1/2-to-1. And he has tight controls on future spending. That\\x92s the kind of balanced approach proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, a bipartisan commission. Now, I think this plan is way better than Governor Romney\\x92s plan. First, the Romney plan failed the first test of fiscal responsibility. The numbers just don\\x92t add up. I mean, consider this. What would you do if you had this problem? Somebody says, oh, we\\x92ve got a big debt problem. We\\x92ve got to reduce the debt. So what\\x92s the first thing you say we\\x92re going to do? Well, to reduce the debt, we\\x92re going to have another five trillion dollars in tax cuts heavily weighted to upper-income people. So we\\x92ll make the debt hole bigger before we start to get out of it. Now, when you say, what are you going to do about this five trillion dollars you just added on? They say, oh, we\\x92ll make it up by eliminating loopholes in the tax code. So then you ask, well, which loopholes, and how much? You know what they say? See me about that after the election. I\\x92m not making it up. That\\x92s their position. See me about that after the election. Now, people ask me all the time how we got four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas did we bring to Washington? I always give a one-word answer: Arithmetic. If -- Arithmetic. If -- If they stay with their five trillion dollar tax cut plan -- in a debt reduction plan? -- the arithmetic tells us, no matter what they say, one of three things is about to happen. One, assuming they try to do what they say they\\x92ll do, get rid of pay -- cover it by deductions, cutting those deductions, one, they\\x92ll have to eliminate so many deductions, like the ones for home mortgages and charitable giving, that middle-class families will see their tax bills go up an average of 2,000 dollars while anybody who makes three million dollars or more will see their tax bill go down 250,000 dollars. Or, two, they\\x92ll have to cut so much spending that they\\x92ll obliterate the budget for the national parks, for ensuring clean air, clean water, safe food, safe air travel. They\\x92ll cut way back on Pell Grants, college loans, early childhood education, child nutrition programs, all the programs that help to empower middle-class families and help poor kids. Oh, they\\x92ll cut back on investments in roads and bridges and science and technology and biomedical research. That\\x92s what they\\x92ll do. They\\x92ll hurt the middle class and the poor and put the future on hold to give tax cuts to upper-income people who\\x92ve been getting it all along. Or three, in spite of all the rhetoric, they\\x92ll just do what they\\x92ve been doing for more than 30 years. They\\x92ll go in and cut the taxes way more than they cut spending, especially with that big defense increase, and they\\x92ll just explode the debt and weaken the economy. And they\\x92ll destroy the federal government\\x92s ability to help you by letting interest gobble up all your tax payments. Don\\x92t you ever forget when you hear them talking about this that Republican economic policies quadrupled the national debt before I took office, in the 12 years before I took office and doubled the debt in the eight years after I left, because it defied arithmetic. It was a highly inconvenient thing for them in our debates that I was just a country boy from Arkansas, and I came from a place where people still thought two and two was four. It\\x92s arithmetic. We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle down. Really. Think about this: President Obama -- President Obama\\x92s plan cuts the debt, honors our values, brightens the future of our children, our families and our nation. It\\x92s a heck of a lot better. It passes the arithmetic test, and far more important, it passes the values test. My fellow Americans, all of us in this grand hall and everybody watching at home, when we vote in this election, we\\x92ll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in. If you want a winner-take- all, you\\x92re-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket. But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we\\x92re-all-in-this-together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. If you -- If you want -- If you want America -- If you want every American to vote and you think it is wrong to change voting procedures just to reduce the turnout of younger, poorer, minority and disabled voters you should support Barack Obama. And if you think -- if you think the President was right to open the doors of American opportunity to all those young immigrants brought here when they were young so they can serve in the military or go to college, you must vote for Barack Obama. If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining, where the American dream is really alive and well again and where the United States maintains its leadership as a force for peace and justice and prosperity in this highly competitive world, you have to vote for Barack Obama. Look, I love our country so much. And I know we\\x92re coming back. For more than 200 years, through every crisis, we\\x92ve always come back. People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticized for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden false teeth. And so far, every single person that\\x92s bet against America has lost money because we always come back. We come through ever fire a little stronger and a little better. And we do it because in the end we decide to champion the cause for which our founders pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor --the cause of forming a more perfect union. My fellow Americans, if that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote and you must re-elect President Barack Obama. God bless you and God bless America.',\n",
       " 'He is home now. He is free. In his final letter to \\r\\nthe American people, Dad wrote, \"I now begin the journey that will lead me into \\r\\nthe sunset of my life.\" This evening, he has arrived. History will record his worth as a leader. We \\r\\nhere have long since measured his worth as a man: Honest, compassionate, \\r\\ngraceful, brave. He was the most plainly decent man you could ever hope to meet. He used to say, \"A gentleman always does the \\r\\nkind thing.\" And, he was a gentleman in the truest sense of the word: A gentle \\r\\nman. Big as he was, he never tried to make anyone \\r\\nfeel small. Powerful as he became, he never took advantage of those who were \\r\\nweaker. Strength, he believed, was never more admirable than when it was applied \\r\\nwith restraint. Shopkeeper, doorman, king or queen, it made no difference. Dad \\r\\ntreated everyone with the same unfailing courtesy -- acknowledging the innate \\r\\ndignity in us all. The idea that all people are created equal was \\r\\nmore than mere words on a page, it was how he lived his life. And he lived a \\r\\ngood, long life -- the kind of life good men lead. But I guess I\\'m just telling you things you \\r\\nalready know. Here\\'s something you may not know, a little \\r\\nRonald Reagan trivia for you. His entire life, Dad had an inordinate fondness \\r\\nfor earlobes. Even as a boy, back in Dixon, Illinois, hanging out on a street \\r\\ncorner with his friends, they knew that if they were standing next to Dutch, \\r\\nsooner or later, he was going to reach over and grab a hold of their lobe, give \\r\\nit a workout there. Sitting on his lap watching TV as a kid, same \\r\\nstory. He\\'d have have hold of my ear lobe. I\\'m surprised I have any lobes left \\r\\nafter all of that. And you didn\\'t have to be a kid to enjoy that \\r\\nsort of treatment. Serving in the Screen Actors Guild with his great friend \\r\\nWilliam Holden, the actor, best man at his wedding, well, Bill got used to it. \\r\\nThey\\'d be there at the meetings, and Dad would have hold of his earlobe. There \\r\\nthey\\'d be, some tense labor negotiation, two big Hollywood movie stars, hand in \\r\\nearlobe. He was, as you know, a famously optimistic man. \\r\\nSometimes such optimism leads you to see the world as you wish it were as \\r\\nopposed to how it really is. At a certain point in his presidency, Dad decided \\r\\nhe was going to revive the thumbs-up gesture. So he went all over the country, \\r\\nof course, giving everybody the thumbs up. Dory [his wife, Doria] and I found \\r\\nourselves in the presidential limousine one day returning from some big event. \\r\\nMy mother was there and Dad was, of course, thumbs-upping the crowd along the \\r\\nway. And suddenly, looming in the window on his side of the car, was this \\r\\nsnarling face. This fellow was reviving an entirely different hand gesture and \\r\\nhoisted an entirely different digit in our direction. Dad saw this and without \\r\\nmissing a beat turned to us and said, \"You see? I think it\\'s catching on.\" Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious \\r\\nman. But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians -- wearing his \\r\\nfaith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and \\r\\nnearly killed early in his presidency, he came to believe that God had spared \\r\\nhim in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, \\r\\nnot a mandate. And there is a profound difference. Humble as he was, he never would have assumed a \\r\\nfree pass to heaven. But in his heart of hearts, I suspect he felt he would be \\r\\nwelcome there. And so he is home. He is free. Those of us who knew him well will have no \\r\\ntrouble imagining his paradise. Golden fields will spread beneath the blue dome \\r\\nof a western sky. Live oaks will shadow the rolling hillsides. And someplace, \\r\\nflowing from years long past, a river will wind towards the sea. Across those \\r\\nfields, he will ride a gray mare he calls Nancy D. They will sail over jumps he \\r\\nhas built with his own hands. He will, at the river, carry him over the shining \\r\\nstones. He will rest in the shade of the trees. Our cares are no longer his. We meet him now \\r\\nonly in memory. But we will join him soon enough -- all of us. When we are home. When we are free.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much Professor Kombay for that \\r\\ngenerous introduction. And let me say, that I never expected to hear such kind \\r\\nwords from Dr. Falwell. So in return, I have an invitation of my own. On January \\r\\n20th, 1985, I hope Dr. Falwell will say a prayer at the inauguration of the next \\r\\nDemocratic President of the United States. Now, Dr. Falwell, I\\x92m not exactly \\r\\nsure how you feel about that. You might not appreciate the President, but the \\r\\nDemocrats certainly would appreciate the prayer. Actually, a number of people in Washington were \\r\\nsurprised that I was invited to speak here -- and even more surprised when I \\r\\naccepted the invitation. They seem to think that it\\x92s easier for a camel to pass \\r\\nthrough the eye of the needle than for a Kennedy to come to the campus of \\r\\nLiberty Baptist College. In honor of our meeting, I have asked Dr. Falwell, as \\r\\nyour Chancellor, to permit all the students an extra hour next Saturday night \\r\\nbefore curfew. And in return, I have promised to watch the Old Time Gospel Hour \\r\\nnext Sunday morning. I realize that my visit may be a little \\r\\ncontroversial. But as many of you have heard, Dr. Falwell recently sent me a \\r\\nmembership in the Moral Majority -- and I didn\\'t even apply for it. And I wonder \\r\\nif that means that I\\'m a member in good standing. [Falwell: Somewhat] Somewhat, he says. This is, of course, a nonpolitical speech which \\r\\nis probably best under the circumstances. Since I am not a candidate for \\r\\nPresident, it would certainly be inappropriate to ask for your support in this \\r\\nelection and probably inaccurate to thank you for it in the last one. I have come here to discuss my beliefs about faith and country,\\r\\ntolerance and truth in America. I know we begin with certain disagreements; and I strongly\\r\\nsuspect that at the end of the evening some of our disagreements will remain. But I also\\r\\nhope that tonight and in the months and years ahead, we will always respect the right of\\r\\nothers to differ, that we will never lose sight of our own fallibility, and that we will view\\r\\nourselves with a sense of perspective and a sense of humor. After all, in the New\\r\\nTestament, even the Disciples had to be taught to look first to the beam in their own\\r\\neyes, and only then to the mote in their neighbor\\x92s eyes. I am mindful of that counsel. I am an American and a Catholic; I\\r\\nlove my country and treasure my faith. But I do not assume that my conception of\\r\\npatriotism or policy is invariably correct, or that my convictions about religion should\\r\\ncommand any greater respect than any other faith in this pluralistic society. I believe\\r\\nthere surely is such a thing as truth, but who among us can claim a monopoly on it? There are those who do, and their own words testify to their\\r\\nintolerance. For example, because the Moral Majority has worked with members of different\\r\\ndenominations, one fundamentalist group has denounced Dr. Falwell for hastening\\r\\nthe ecumenical church and for \"yoking together with Roman Catholics, Mormons, and\\r\\nothers.\" I am relieved that Dr. Falwell does not regard that as a sin, and on this\\r\\nissue, he himself has become the target of narrow prejudice. When people agree on public\\r\\npolicy, they ought to be able to work together, even while they worship in diverse ways.\\r\\nFor truly we are all yoked together as Americans, and the yoke is the happy one of\\r\\nindividual freedom and mutual respect. But in saying that, we cannot and should not turn aside from a\\r\\ndeeper and more pressing question -- which is whether and how religion should influence\\r\\ngovernment. A generation ago, a presidential candidate had to prove his independence of\\r\\nundue religious influence in public life, and he had to do so partly at the insistence of\\r\\nevangelical Protestants. John Kennedy said at that time: \\x93I believe in an America\\r\\nwhere there is no  religious bloc voting of any kind.\\x94 Only twenty years later,\\r\\nanother candidate was appealing to a[n] evangelical meeting as a religious bloc. Ronald\\r\\nReagan said to 15 thousand evangelicals at the Roundtable in Dallas: \\x93 I know that\\r\\nyou can\\x92t endorse me. I want you to know I endorse you and what you are\\r\\ndoing.\\x94 To many Americans, that pledge was a sign and a symbol of a\\r\\ndangerous breakdown in the separation of church and state. Yet this principle, as vital as\\r\\nit is, is not a simplistic and rigid command. Separation of church and state cannot mean\\r\\nan absolute separation between moral principles and political power. The challenge today\\r\\nis to recall the origin of the principle, to define its purpose, and refine its\\r\\napplication to the politics of the present. The founders of our nation had long and bitter experience with the\\r\\nstate, as both the agent and the adversary of particular religious views. In colonial\\r\\nMaryland, Catholics paid a double land tax, and in Pennsylvania they had to list their\\r\\nnames on a public roll -- an ominous precursor of the first Nazi laws against the Jews. And\\r\\nJews in turn faced discrimination in all of the thirteen original Colonies. Massachusetts\\r\\nexiled Roger Williams and his congregation for contending that civil government had no\\r\\nright to enforce the Ten Commandments. Virginia harassed Baptist teachers, and also\\r\\nestablished a religious test for public service, writing into the law that no \\x93popish\\r\\nfollowers\\x94 could hold any office. But during the Revolution, Catholics, Jews, and Non-Conformists all\\r\\nrallied to the cause and fought valiantly for the American commonwealth -- for John\\r\\nWinthrop\\x92s \\x93city upon a hill.\\x94 Afterwards, when the Constitution was\\r\\nratified and then amended, the framers gave freedom for all religion, and from any\\r\\nestablished religion, the very first place in the Bill of Rights. Indeed the framers themselves professed very different\\r\\nfaiths: Washington was an Episcopalian, Jefferson a deist, and Adams a Calvinist. And\\r\\nalthough he had earlier opposed toleration, John Adams later contributed to the building\\r\\nof Catholic churches, and so did George Washington. Thomas Jefferson said his proudest\\r\\nachievement was not the presidency, or the writing the Declaration of Independence, but\\r\\ndrafting the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. He stated the vision of the first\\r\\nAmericans and the First Amendment very clearly: \\x93The God who gave us life gave us\\r\\nliberty at the same time.\\x94 The separation of church and state can sometimes be frustrating for\\r\\nwomen and men of religious faith. They may be tempted to misuse government in order\\r\\nto impose a value which they cannot persuade others to accept. But once we succumb to that\\r\\ntemptation, we step onto a slippery slope where everyone\\x92s freedom is at risk. Those\\r\\nwho favor censorship should recall that one of the first books ever burned was the first\\r\\nEnglish translation of the Bible. As President Eisenhower warned in 1953, \\x93Don\\x92t\\r\\njoin the book burners...the right to say ideas, the right to record them, and the right to\\r\\nhave them accessible to others is unquestioned -- or this isn\\x92t America.\\x94 And if\\r\\nthat right is denied, at some future day the torch can be turned against any other book or\\r\\nany other belief. Let us never forget: Today\\x92s Moral Majority could become\\r\\ntomorrow\\x92s persecuted minority. The danger is as great now as when the founders of the nation first\\r\\nsaw it. In 1789, their fear was of factional strife among dozens of denominations. Today\\r\\nthere are hundreds -- and perhaps even thousands of faiths -- and millions of Americans who are\\r\\noutside any fold. Pluralism obviously does not and cannot mean that all of them are right;\\r\\nbut it does mean that there are areas where government cannot and should not decide what\\r\\nis wrong to believe, to think, to read, and to do. As Professor Larry Tribe, one of the\\r\\nnation\\x92s leading constitutional scholars has written, \\x93Law in a non-theocratic \\r\\nstate cannot measure religious truth, nor can the state impose it.\" The real transgression occurs when religion wants government to tell\\r\\ncitizens how to live uniquely personal parts of their lives. The failure of Prohibition\\r\\nproves the futility of such an attempt when a majority or even a substantial minority\\r\\nhappens to disagree. Some questions may be inherently individual ones, or people may be\\r\\nsharply divided about whether they are. In such cases, like Prohibition and\\r\\nabortion, the proper role of religion is to appeal to the conscience of the individual,\\r\\nnot the coercive power of the state. But there are other questions which are inherently public in nature,\\r\\nwhich we must decide together as a nation, and where religion and religious values can and\\r\\nshould speak to our common conscience. The issue of nuclear war is a compelling example.\\r\\nIt is a moral issue; it will be decided by government, not by each individual; and to give\\r\\nany effect to the moral values of their creed, people of faith must speak directly about\\r\\npublic policy. The Catholic bishops and the Reverend Billy Graham have every right to\\r\\nstand for the nuclear freeze, and Dr. Falwell has every right to stand against it. There must be standards for the exercise of such leadership, so that\\r\\nthe obligations of belief will not be debased into an opportunity for mere political\\r\\nadvantage. But to take a stand at all when a question is both properly public and truly\\r\\nmoral is to stand in a long and honored tradition. Many of the great evangelists of the\\r\\n1800s were in the forefront of the abolitionist movement. In our own time, the Reverend\\r\\nWilliam Sloane Coffin challenged the morality of the war in Vietnam. Pope John XXIII\\r\\nrenewed the Gospel\\x92s call to social justice. And Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who was\\r\\nthe greatest prophet of this century, awakened our nation and its conscience to the evil of\\r\\nracial segregation. Their words have blessed our world. And who now wishes they had \\r\\nbeen silent? Who would bid Pope John Paul [II] to quiet his voice against the oppression in\\r\\nEastern Europe, the violence in Central America, or the crying needs of the landless, the\\r\\nhungry, and those who are tortured in so many of the dark political prisons of our time? President Kennedy, who said that \\x93no religious body should seek\\r\\nto impose its will,\\x94 also urged religious leaders to state their views and give their\\r\\ncommitment when the public debate involved ethical issues. In drawing the line between\\r\\nimposed will and essential witness, we keep church and state separate, and at the same\\r\\ntime we recognize that the City of God should speak to the civic duties of men and women. There are four tests which draw that line and define the difference. First, we must respect the integrity of religion itself. People of conscience should be careful how they deal in the word of\\r\\ntheir Lord. In our own history, religion has been falsely invoked to sanction prejudice \\r\\n-- even slavery -- to condemn labor unions and public spending for the poor. I believe that\\r\\nthe prophecy, \"The poor you always have with you\" is an indictment, not a\\r\\ncommandment. And I respectfully suggest that God has taken no position on the \\r\\nDepartment of Education -- and that a balanced budget constitutional amendment \\r\\nis a matter of economic\\r\\nanalysis, and not heavenly appeals. Religious values cannot be excluded from every public issue; but not\\r\\nevery public issue involves religious values. And how ironic it is when those very values\\r\\nare denied in the name of religion. For example, we are sometimes told that it is wrong to\\r\\nfeed the hungry, but that mission is an explicit mandate given to us in the 25th chapter\\r\\nof Matthew. Second, we must respect the independent judgments of conscience. Those who proclaim moral and religious values can offer counsel, but\\r\\nthey should not casually treat a position on a public issue as a test of fealty to faith.\\r\\nJust as I disagree with the Catholic bishops on tuition tax credits -- which I oppose -- so\\r\\nother Catholics can and do disagree with the hierarchy, on the basis of honest conviction,\\r\\non the question of the nuclear freeze. Thus, the controversy about the Moral Majority arises not only from\\r\\nits views, but from its name -- which, in the minds of many, seems to imply that only one set\\r\\nof public policies is moral and only one majority can possibly be right. Similarly, people are and should be perplexed when the\\r\\nreligious lobbying group Christian Voice publishes a morality index of congressional\\r\\nvoting records, which judges the morality of senators by their attitude toward Zimbabwe\\r\\nand Taiwan. Let me offer another illustration. Dr. Falwell has written -- and I\\r\\nquote: \\x93To stand against Israel is to stand against God.\\x94 Now there is no one in\\r\\nthe Senate who has stood more firmly for Israel than I have. Yet, I do not doubt the faith\\r\\nof those on the other side. Their error is not one of religion, but of policy. And I hope\\r\\nto be able to persuade them that -- that they are wrong in terms of both America\\x92s interest and the\\r\\njustice of Israel\\x92s cause. Respect for conscience is most in jeopardy, and the harmony of our\\r\\ndiverse society is most at risk, when we re-establish, directly or indirectly, a religious\\r\\ntest for public office. That relic of the colonial era, which is specifically prohibited\\r\\nin the Constitution, has reappeared in recent years. After the last election, the Reverend\\r\\nJames Robison -- Robison warned President Reagan no to surround himself, as president before him had,\\r\\n\\x93with the counsel of the ungodly.\\x94 I utterly reject any such standard for any\\r\\nposition anywhere in public service. Two centuries ago, the victims were Catholics and\\r\\nJews. In the 1980s the victims could be atheists; in some other day or decade, they could\\r\\nbe the members of the Thomas Road Baptist Church. Indeed, in 1976 I regarded it as\\r\\nunworthy and un-American when some people said or hinted that Jimmy Carter should not be\\r\\npresident because he was a born again Christian. We must never judge the fitness of\\r\\nindividuals to govern on the bas[is] of where they worship, whether they follow Christ or\\r\\nMoses, whether they are called \\x93born again\\x94 or \\x93ungodly.\\x94 Where it is\\r\\nright to apply moral values to public life, let all of us avoid the temptation to be\\r\\nself-righteous and absolutely certain of ourselves. And if that temptation ever comes, let\\r\\nus recall Winston Churchill\\x92s humbling description of an intolerant and inflexible\\r\\ncolleague: \\x93There but for the grace of God goes God.\\x94 Third, in applying religious values, we must respect the integrity\\r\\nof public debate. In that debate, faith is no substitute for facts. Critics may oppose\\r\\nthe nuclear freeze for what they regard as moral reasons. They have every right to argue\\r\\nthat any negotiation with the Soviets is wrong, or that any accommodation with them\\r\\nsanctions their crimes, or that no agreement can be good enough and therefore all\\r\\nagreements only increase the chance of war. I do not believe that, but it surely does not\\r\\nviolate the standard of fair public debate to say it. What does violate that standard, what the opponents of the nuclear\\r\\nfreeze have no right to do, is to assume that they are infallible, and so any argument\\r\\nagainst the freeze will do, whether it is false or true. The nuclear freeze proposal is not unilateral, but bilateral -- with\\r\\nequal restraints on the United States and the Soviet Union. The nuclear freeze does not require that we trust the Russians, but\\r\\ndemands full and effective verification. The nuclear freeze does not concede a Soviet lead in nuclear\\r\\nweapons, but recognizes that human beings in each great power already have in their\\r\\nfallible hands the overwhelming capacity to remake into a pile of radioactive rubble the\\r\\nearth which God has made. There is no morality -- There is \\r\\nno morality in the mushroom cloud. The black rain of\\r\\nnuclear ashes will fall alike on the just and the unjust. And then it will be too late to wish\\r\\nthat we had done the real work of this atomic age -- which is to seek a world that is\\r\\nneither red nor dead. I am perfectly prepared to debate the nuclear freeze on policy\\r\\ngrounds, or moral ones. But we should not be forced to discuss phantom issues or false\\r\\ncharges. They only deflect us form the urgent task of deciding how best to prevent a\\r\\nplanet divided from becoming a planet destroyed. And it does not advance the debate to contend that the arms race is\\r\\nmore divine punishment than human problem, or that in any event, the final days are near.\\r\\nAs Pope John said two decades ago, at the opening of the Second Vatican Council: \\x93We\\r\\nmust beware of those who burn with zeal, but are not endowed with much sense... we must\\r\\ndisagree with the prophets of doom, who are always forecasting disasters, as though the end\\r\\nof the earth was at hand.\\x94 The message which echoes across the years is \\r\\nvery clear: The\\r\\nearth is still here; and if we wish to keep it, a prophecy of doom is no alternative to a\\r\\npolicy of arms control. Fourth, and finally, we must respect the motives of those who\\r\\nexercise their right to disagree. We sorely test our ability to live together if we readily\\r\\nquestion each other\\x92s integrity. It may be harder to restrain our feelings when moral\\r\\nprinciples are at stake, for they go to the deepest wellsprings of our being. But the more\\r\\nour feelings diverge, the more deeply felt they are, the greater is our obligation to\\r\\ngrant the sincerity and essential decency of our fellow citizens on the other side. Those who favor E.R.A [Equal Rights Amendment] are not\\r\\n\\x93antifamily\\x94 or \\x93blasphemers.\\x94 And their purpose is not \\x93an attack\\r\\non the Bible.\\x94 Rather, we believe this is the best way to fix in our national\\r\\nfirmament the ideal that not only all men, but all people are created equal. Indeed, my\\r\\nmother, who strongly favors E.R.A., would be surprised to hear that she is anti-family.\\r\\nFor my part, I think of the amendment\\x92s opponents as wrong on the issue, but not as\\r\\nlacking in moral character I could multiply the instances of name-calling, sometimes on both\\r\\nsides. Dr. Falwell is not a \\x93warmonger.\\x94 And \\x93liberal clergymen\\x94 are\\r\\nnot, as the Moral Majority suggested in a recent letter, equivalent to \\x93Soviet\\r\\nsympathizers.\\x94 The critics of official prayer in public schools are not\\r\\n\\x93Pharisees\\x94; many of them are both civil libertarians and believers, who think\\r\\nthat families should pray more at home with their children, and attend church and\\r\\nsynagogue more faithfully. And people are not sexist because they stand against \\r\\nabortion, and they are not murderers because they believe in free choice.Nor does it help anyone -- Nor does it help anyone\\x92s cause to shout such epithets, or to try \\r\\nand shout a speaker down -- which is what happened last April when Dr. Falwell was\\r\\nhissed and heckled at Harvard. So I am doubly grateful for your courtesy here \\r\\nthis evening. That\\r\\nwas not Harvard\\x92s finest hour, but I am happy to say that the loudest applause from\\r\\nthe Harvard audience came in defense of Dr. Falwell\\x92s right to speak. In short, I hope for an America where neither \"fundamentalist\" nor\\r\\n\"humanist\" will be a dirty word, but a fair description of the different ways in which\\r\\npeople of goodwill look at life and into their own souls. I hope for an America where no president, no public official, no\\r\\nindividual will ever be deemed a greater or lesser American because of religious doubt -- or\\r\\nreligious belief. I hope for an America where the power of faith will always burn\\r\\nbrightly, but where no modern Inquisition of any kind will ever light the fires of fear,\\r\\ncoercion, or angry division. I hope for an America where we can all contend freely and\\r\\nvigorously, but where we will treasure and guard those standards of civility which alone\\r\\nmake this nation safe for both democracy and diversity. Twenty years ago this fall, in New York City, President Kennedy met\\r\\nfor the last time with a Protestant assembly. The atmosphere had been transformed sincehis earlier address during the 1960 campaign to the Houston Ministerial Association. He\\r\\nhad spoken there to allay suspicions about his Catholicism, and to answer those \\r\\nwho claimed that on the day of his baptism, he was somehow disqualified from\\r\\nbecoming President. His speech in Houston and then his election drove that prejudice from the\\r\\ncenter of our national life. Now, three years later, in November of 1963, he was appearing\\r\\nbefore the Protestant Council of New York City to reaffirm what he regarded as some\\r\\nfundamental truths. On that occasion, John Kennedy said: \\x93The family of man is not\\r\\nlimited to a single race or religion, to a single city, or country...the family of man is\\r\\nnearly 3 billion strong. Most of its members are not white and most of them are not\\r\\nChristian.\\x94 And as President Kennedy reflected on that reality, he restated an ideal\\r\\nfor which he had lived his life -- that \\x93the members of this family should be at peace\\r\\nwith one another.\\x94 That ideal shines across all the generations of our history and all\\r\\nthe ages of our faith, carrying with it the most ancient dream. For as the Apostle Paul\\r\\nwrote long ago in Romans: \\x93If it be possible, as much as it lieth in you, live\\r\\npeaceably with all men.\\x94 I believe it is possible; the choice lies within us; as fellow\\r\\ncitizens, let us live peaceable with each other; as fellow human beings, let us strive to\\r\\nlive peaceably with men and women everywhere. Let that be our purpose and our\\r\\nprayer, yours and mine -- for ourselves, for our country, and for all the world.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Gephardt, \\r\\nSenator Daschle, Representative Carson, Senator Abraham, Representative Clyburn, \\r\\nRepresentative Watts -- to all the members of the House and the Senate here, and \\r\\nthose not here, who supported this resolution, I thank you for what you have \\r\\ndone -- Dr. Ogilvie, Dr. Ford, Reverend Jackson, members of the Cabinet and the \\r\\ncivil rights community who are here -- Dr. Height. I\\'d like to say a special word of welcome to two \\r\\nmembers of theLittle Rock Ninewho came here to honorRosa Parks--Minnie Jean \\r\\nBrown- Trickeyand Robert Jefferson [Jefferson \\r\\nThomas?] -- welcome to you. I\\xa0-- thank you. I want to thank the Howard University Gospel \\r\\nChoir and the incomparableJessye Normanfor their wonderful, wonderful music. The previous speakers have spoken with great \\r\\npower, eloquence, and truth. In less than 200 days now, we will mark the end of \\r\\nanother century. They have told you the story of one brave woman, and the \\r\\nripples of impact she had upon all the millions of people who live in the \\r\\nUnited States. It is, in many ways, the quintessential story of the 20th Century \\r\\n-- a time with trials and tribulations which still, fundamentally, is the story \\r\\nof the triumph of freedom -- of democracy over dictatorship, free enterprise \\r\\nover state socialism, of tolerance over bigotry. It was a fight waged on the beaches of Normandy, \\r\\non the islands of the South Pacific, at Checkpoint Charlie, behind the Iron \\r\\nCurtain, and countless known and unknown, large and small villages, across the \\r\\nglobe. Here, at home, the fight waged in classrooms, lunch counters, and on public \\r\\nbuses in the segregated South. For us, what has always been at stake is whether \\r\\nwe could keep moving on that stony road, closer to the ideals of our Founders -- \\r\\nwhether we really could be a country where we are all equal, not only endowed by \\r\\nour Creator with -- but in fact living with -- the rights to life, liberty, and \\r\\nthe pursuit of happiness. Forty-four years ago, Rosa Parks reminded us all \\r\\nthat we were a long way from those ideals; that for millions of Americans, our \\r\\nhistory was full of weary years -- our sweet land of liberty bearing only bitter \\r\\nfruit and silent tears. And so she sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, \\r\\n\"by the accumulated indignities of days gone by, and the countless aspirations \\r\\nof generations yet unborn.\" Rosa Parks said, \"I didn\\'t get on that bus to get \\r\\narrested. I got on that bus to go home.\" In so many ways, Rosa Parks brought \\r\\nAmerica home, to our Founders\\' dream. You know, when we look across the history of the \\r\\ncivil rights movement, we celebrate President Lincoln and the Congress of that \\r\\nera for the Constitutional amendments. We celebrate William Lloyd Garrison and \\r\\nFrederick Douglass. In our own period, we celebrate President Eisenhower and \\r\\nsending the troops to Little Rock, the commitment of John and Robert Kennedy, \\r\\nthe magnificent legislative achievements of President Johnson and that Congress \\r\\n-- reaching across party lines. But we know that in a funny way, people who have \\r\\nno position or money and have only the power of their courage and character are \\r\\nalways there before the political leaders. We know that. When Rosa Parks got on that bus in Alabama, I was \\r\\na nine-year-old boy, living in Arkansas, going to segregated schools, riding \\r\\npublic buses every single day, where all the colored people sat in the back. My \\r\\nfamily got a television when I was nine years old, just a few months before it \\r\\nbecame worldwide news that Mrs. Parks had gotten on the bus. I thought it was a \\r\\npretty good deal, and so did my friends. And we couldn\\'t figure out anything we \\r\\ncould do, since we couldn\\'t even vote. So, we began to sit on the back of the \\r\\nbus when we got on. It seems like -- I say this -- now, this this is a \\r\\nlittle thing. I say it only to say we must never, ever -- when this ceremony is \\r\\nover -- forget about the power of ordinary people to stand in the fire for the \\r\\ncause of human dignity, and to touch the hearts of people that have almost \\r\\nturned to stone.  I thank the Congress for honoring Rosa Parks. I \\r\\nwas honored, Rosa, to give you the Medal of Freedom, and I was thrilled during \\r\\nthe State of the Union Address when you got that enormous, bipartisan ovation \\r\\nhere. But remember, my fellow Americans, freedom\\'s work is never done. There are \\r\\nstill people who are discriminated against. There are still people --\\xa0 \\r\\nthere are still people who because of their human condition are looked down on, \\r\\nderided, degraded, demeaned, and we should all remember the powerful example of \\r\\nthis one citizen. And those of us with greater authority and power should \\r\\nattempt every day, in every way, to follow her lead. God bless you, Mrs. Parks, and God bless America.',\n",
       " 'Thanks very much, BarbaraMikulski, for \\r\\nyour very eloquent, your eloquent introduction. Distinguished legislator, great \\r\\nspokeswoman for economic democracy and social justice in this country, I thank \\r\\nyou for your eloquent introduction. Well, things worked out a little \\r\\ndifferent from the way I thought, but let me tell you, I still love New York. My fellow Democrats and my fellow \\r\\nAmericans, I have come here tonight not to argue as a candidate but to affirm a \\r\\ncause. I\\'m asking you -- I am asking you to \\r\\nrenew the commitment of the Democratic Party to economic justice. I am asking you to renew our \\r\\ncommitment to a fair and lasting prosperity that can put America back to work. This is the cause that brought me \\r\\ninto the campaign and that sustained me for nine months across a 100,000 miles \\r\\nin 40 different states. We had our losses, but the pain of our defeats is far, \\r\\nfar less than the pain of the people that I have met. We have learned that it is important \\r\\nto take issues seriously, but never to take ourselves too seriously. The serious issue before us tonight \\r\\nis the cause for which the Democratic Party has stood in its finest hours, the \\r\\ncause that keeps our Party young and makes it, in the second century of its age, \\r\\nthe largest political Party in this republic and the longest lasting political \\r\\nParty on this planet. Our cause has been, since the days \\r\\nof Thomas Jefferson, the cause of the common man and the common woman. Our commitment has been, since the \\r\\ndays of Andrew Jackson, to all those he called \"the humble members of society -- \\r\\nthe farmers, mechanics, and laborers.\" On this foundation we have defined our \\r\\nvalues, refined our policies, and refreshed our faith. Now I take the unusual step of \\r\\ncarrying the cause and the commitment of my campaign personally to our national \\r\\nconvention. I speak out of a deep sense of urgency about the anguish and anxiety \\r\\nI have seen across America. I speak out of a deep belief in the \\r\\nideals of the Democratic Party, and in the potential of that Party and of a \\r\\nPresident to make a difference. And I speak out of a deep trust in our capacity \\r\\nto proceed with boldness and a common vision that will feel and heal the \\r\\nsuffering of our time and the divisions of our Party. The economic plank of this platform \\r\\non its face concerns only material things, but it is also a moral issue that I \\r\\nraise tonight. It has taken many forms over many years. In this campaign and in \\r\\nthis country that we seek to lead, the challenge in 1980 is to give our voice \\r\\nand our vote for these fundamental democratic principles. Let us pledge that we will never \\r\\nmisuse unemployment, high interest rates, and human misery as false weapons \\r\\nagainst inflation. Let us pledge that employment will \\r\\nbe the first priority of our economic policy. Let us pledge that there will be \\r\\nsecurity for all those who are now at work, and let us pledge that there will be \\r\\njobs for all who are out of work; and we will not compromise on the issues of \\r\\njobs. These are not simplistic pledges. \\r\\nSimply put, they are the heart of our tradition, and they have been the soul of \\r\\nour Party across the generations. It is the glory and the greatness of our \\r\\ntradition to speak for those who have no voice, to remember those who are \\r\\nforgotten, to respond to the frustrations and fulfill the aspirations of all \\r\\nAmericans seeking a better life in a better land. We dare not forsake that tradition. We cannot let the great purposes of \\r\\nthe Democratic Party become the bygone passages of history. We must not permit the Republicans \\r\\nto seize and run on the slogans of prosperity. We heard the orators at their \\r\\nconvention all trying to talk like Democrats.They proved that even Republican \\r\\nnominees can quote Franklin Roosevelt to their own purpose. The Grand Old Party thinks it has \\r\\nfound a great new trick, but 40 years ago an earlier generation of Republicans \\r\\nattempted the same trick. And Franklin Roosevelt himself replied, \"Most \\r\\nRepublican leaders have bitterly fought and blocked the forward surge of average \\r\\nmen and women in their pursuit of happiness. Let us not be deluded that \\r\\novernight those leaders have suddenly become the friends of average men and \\r\\nwomen.\" \"You know,\" he continued, \"very few \\r\\nof us are that gullible.\" And four years later when the Republicans tried that \\r\\ntrick again, Franklin Roosevelt asked, \"Can the Old Guard pass itself off as the \\r\\nNew Deal? I think not. We have all seen many marvelous stunts in the circus, but \\r\\nno performing elephant could turn a handspring without falling flat on its \\r\\nback.\" The 1980 Republican convention was \\r\\nawash with crocodile tears for our economic distress, but it is by their long \\r\\nrecord and not their recent words that you shall know them. The same Republicans who are talking \\r\\nabout the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said, and I \\r\\nquote, \"Unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders.\" And \\r\\nthat nominee is no friend of labor. The same Republicans who are talking \\r\\nabout the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said, and I \\r\\nquote, \"I have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer \\r\\nthat the Federal Government not bail out New York.\" And that nominee is no \\r\\nfriend of this city and our great urban centers across this nation. The same Republicans who are talking \\r\\nabout security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago \\r\\nthat \"Participation in social security should be made voluntary.\" And that \\r\\nnominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation. The same Republicans who are talking \\r\\nabout preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the \\r\\npreposterous statement, and I quote, \"Eighty percent of our air pollution comes \\r\\nfrom plants and trees.\" And that nominee is no friend of the environment. And the same Republicans who are \\r\\ninvoking Franklin Roosevelt have nominated a man who said in 1976, and these are \\r\\nhis exact words, \"Fascism was really the basis of the New Deal.\" And that \\r\\nnominee whose name is Ronald Reagan has no right to quote Franklin Delano \\r\\nRoosevelt. The great adventures which our \\r\\nopponents offer is a voyage into the past. Progress is our heritage, not theirs. \\r\\nWhat is right for us as Democrats is also the right way for Democrats to win. The commitment I seek is not to \\r\\noutworn views but to old values that will never wear out. Programs may sometimes \\r\\nbecome obsolete, but the ideal of fairness always endures. Circumstances may \\r\\nchange, but the work of compassion must continue. It is surely correct that we \\r\\ncannot solve problems by throwing money at them, but it is also correct that we \\r\\ndare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and \\r\\nindifference. The poor may be out of political fashion, but they are not without \\r\\nhuman needs. The middle class may be angry, but they have not lost the dream \\r\\nthat all Americans can advance together. The demand of our people in 1980 is \\r\\nnot for smaller government or bigger government but for better government. Some \\r\\nsay that government is always bad and that spending for basic social programs is \\r\\nthe root of our economic evils. But we reply: The present inflation and \\r\\nrecession cost our economy 200 billion dollars a year. We reply: Inflation and \\r\\nunemployment are the biggest spenders of all. The task of leadership in 1980 is \\r\\nnot to parade scapegoats or to seek refuge in reaction, but to match our power \\r\\nto the possibilities of progress. While others talked of free enterprise, it was \\r\\nthe Democratic Party that acted and we ended excessive regulation in the airline \\r\\nand trucking industry, and we restored competition to the marketplace. And I \\r\\ntake some satisfaction that this deregulation legislation that I sponsored and \\r\\npassed in the Congress of the United States. As Democrats we recognize that each \\r\\ngeneration of Americans has a rendezvous with a different reality. The answers \\r\\nof one generation become the questions of the next generation. But there is a \\r\\nguiding star in the American firmament. It is as old as the revolutionary belief \\r\\nthat all people are created equal, and as clear as the contemporary condition of \\r\\nLiberty City and the South Bronx. Again and again Democratic leaders have \\r\\nfollowed that star and they have given new meaning to the old values of liberty \\r\\nand justice for all. We are the Party -- We are the Party \\r\\nof the New Freedom, the New Deal, and the New Frontier. We have always been the \\r\\nParty of hope. So this year let us offer new hope, new hope to an America \\r\\nuncertain about the present, but unsurpassed in its potential for the future. To all those who are idle in the \\r\\ncities and industries of America let us provide new hope for the dignity of \\r\\nuseful work. Democrats have always believed that a basic civil right of all \\r\\nAmericans is that their right to earn their own way. The Party of the people \\r\\nmust always be the Party of full employment. To all those who doubt the future of \\r\\nour economy, let us provide new hope for the reindustrialization of America. And \\r\\nlet our vision reach beyond the next election or the next year to a new \\r\\ngeneration of prosperity. If we could rebuild Germany and Japan after World War \\r\\nII, then surely we can reindustrialize our own nation and revive our inner \\r\\ncities in the 1980\\'s. To all those who work hard for a \\r\\nliving wage let us provide new hope that their price of their employment shall \\r\\nnot be an unsafe workplace and a death at an earlier age. To all those who inhabit our land \\r\\nfrom California to the New York Island, from the Redwood Forest to the Gulf \\r\\nstream waters, let us provide new hope that prosperity shall not be purchased by \\r\\npoisoning the air, the rivers, and the natural resources that are the greatest \\r\\ngift of this continent. We must insist that our children and our grandchildren \\r\\nshall inherit a land which they can truly call America the beautiful. To all those who see the worth of \\r\\ntheir work and their savings taken by inflation, let us offer new hope for a \\r\\nstable economy. We must meet the pressures of the present by invoking the full \\r\\npower of government to master increasing prices. In candor, we must say that the \\r\\nFederal budget can be balanced only by policies that bring us to a balanced \\r\\nprosperity of full employment and price restraint. And to all those overburdened by an \\r\\nunfair tax structure, let us provide new hope for real tax reform. Instead of \\r\\nshutting down classrooms, let us shut off tax shelters. Instead of cutting out \\r\\nschool lunches, let us cut off tax subsidies for expensive business lunches that \\r\\nare nothing more than food stamps for the rich. The tax cut of our Republican \\r\\nopponents takes the name of tax reform in vain. It is a wonderfully Republican \\r\\nidea that would redistribute income in the wrong direction. It\\'s good news for \\r\\nany of you with incomes over 200,000 dollars a year. For the few of you, it \\r\\noffers a pot of gold worth 14,000 dollars. But the Republican tax cut is bad \\r\\nnews for the middle income families. For the many of you, they plan a pittance \\r\\nof 200 dollars a year, and that is not what the Democratic Party means when we \\r\\nsay tax reform. The vast majority of Americans \\r\\ncannot afford this panacea from a Republican nominee who has denounced the \\r\\nprogressive income tax as the invention of Karl Marx. I am afraid he has \\r\\nconfused Karl Marx with Theodore Roosevelt -- that obscure Republican president \\r\\nwho sought and fought for a tax system based on ability to pay. Theodore \\r\\nRoosevelt was not Karl Marx, and the Republican tax scheme is not tax reform. Finally, we cannot have a fair \\r\\nprosperity in isolation from a fair society. So I will continue to stand for a \\r\\nnational health insurance. We must -- We must not surrender -- We must not \\r\\nsurrender to the relentless medical inflation that can bankrupt almost anyone \\r\\nand that may soon break the budgets of government at every level. Let us insist \\r\\non real controls over what doctors and hospitals can charge, and let us resolve \\r\\nthat the state of a family\\'s health shall never depend on the size of a family\\'s \\r\\nwealth. The President, the Vice President, \\r\\nthe members of Congress have a medical plan that meets their needs in full, and \\r\\nwhenever senators and representatives catch a little cold, the Capitol physician \\r\\nwill see them immediately, treat them promptly, fill a prescription on the spot. \\r\\nWe do not get a bill even if we ask for it, and when do you think was the last \\r\\ntime a member of Congress asked for a bill from the Federal Government? And I \\r\\nsay again, as I have before, if health insurance is good enough for the \\r\\nPresident, the Vice President, the Congress of the United States, then it\\'s good \\r\\nenough for you and every family in America. There were some -- There were some \\r\\nwho said we should be silent about our differences on issues during this \\r\\nconvention, but the heritage of the Democratic Party has been a history of \\r\\ndemocracy. We fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and \\r\\npurposes. We did not flee this struggle. We welcome the contrast with the empty \\r\\nand expedient spectacle last month in Detroit where no nomination was contested, \\r\\nno question was debated, and no one dared to raise any doubt or dissent. Democrats can be proud that we chose \\r\\na different course and a different platform. We can be proud that our Party \\r\\nstands for investment in safe energy, instead of a nuclear future that may \\r\\nthreaten the future itself. We must not permit the neighborhoods of America to \\r\\nbe permanently shadowed by the fear of another Three Mile Island. We can be proud that our Party \\r\\nstands for a fair housing law to unlock the doors of discrimination once and for \\r\\nall. The American house will be divided against itself so long as there is \\r\\nprejudice against any American buying or renting a home. And we can be proud that our Party \\r\\nstands plainly and publicly and persistently for the ratification of the Equal \\r\\nRights Amendment. Women hold their rightful place at \\r\\nour convention, and women must have their rightful place in the Constitution of \\r\\nthe United States. On this issue we will not yield; we will not equivocate; we \\r\\nwill not rationalize, explain, or excuse. We will stand for E.R.A. and for the \\r\\nrecognition at long last that our nation was made up of founding mothers as well \\r\\nas founding fathers. A fair prosperity and a just society \\r\\nare within our vision and our grasp, and we do not have every answer. There are \\r\\nquestions not yet asked, waiting for us in the recesses of the future. But of \\r\\nthis much we can be certain because it is the lesson of all of our history: \\r\\nTogether a President and the people can make a difference. I have found that \\r\\nfaith still alive wherever I have traveled across this land. So let us reject \\r\\nthe counsel of retreat and the call to reaction. Let us go forward in the \\r\\nknowledge that history only helps those who help themselves. There will be setbacks and \\r\\nsacrifices in the years ahead; but I am convinced that we as a people are ready \\r\\nto give something back to our country in return for all it has given to us. Let this -- Let this be our \\r\\ncommitment: Whatever sacrifices must be made will be shared and shared fairly. \\r\\nAnd let this be our confidence: At the end of our journey and always before us \\r\\nshines that ideal of liberty and justice for all. In closing, let me say a few words \\r\\nto all those that I have met and to all those who have supported me at this \\r\\nconvention and across the country. There were hard hours on our journey, and \\r\\noften we sailed against the wind. But always we kept our rudder true, and there \\r\\nwere so many of you who stayed the course and shared our hope. You gave your \\r\\nhelp; but even more, you gave your hearts. And because of you, this has been a \\r\\nhappy campaign. You welcomed Joan, me, and our family into your homes and \\r\\nneighborhoods, your churches, your campuses, your union halls. And when I think \\r\\nback of all the miles and all the months and all the memories, I think of you. \\r\\nAnd I recall the poet\\'s words, and I say: \"What golden friends I had.\" Among you, my golden friends across \\r\\nthis land, I have listened and learned. I have listened to Kenny Dubois, a \\r\\nglassblower in Charleston, West Virginia, who has ten children to support but \\r\\nhas lost his job after 35 years, just three years short of qualifying for his \\r\\npension. I have listened to the Trachta \\r\\nfamily who farm in Iowa and who wonder whether they can pass the good life and \\r\\nthe good earth on to their children. I have listened to the grandmother \\r\\nin East Oakland who no longer has a phone to call her grandchildren because she \\r\\ngave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment. I have listened to young workers out \\r\\nof work, to students without the tuition for college, and to families without \\r\\nthe chance to own a home. I have seen the closed factories and \\r\\nthe stalled assembly lines of Anderson, Indiana and South Gate, California, and \\r\\nI have seen too many, far too many idle men and women desperate to work. I have seen too many, far too many \\r\\nworking families desperate to protect the value of their wages from the ravages \\r\\nof inflation. Yet I have also sensed a yearning \\r\\nfor a new hope among the people in every state where I have been. And I have felt it in their \\r\\nhandshakes, I saw it in their faces, and I shall never forget the mothers who \\r\\ncarried children to our rallies. I shall always remember the elderly \\r\\nwho have lived in an America of high purpose and who believe that it can all \\r\\nhappen again. Tonight, in their name, I have come \\r\\nhere to speak for them. And for their sake, I ask you to stand with them. On \\r\\ntheir behalf I ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of our Party. I congratulate President Carter on \\r\\nhis victory here. I am -- I am confident that the \\r\\nDemocratic Party will reunite on the basis of Democratic principles, and that \\r\\ntogether we will march towards a Democratic victory in 1980. And someday, long after this \\r\\nconvention, long after the signs come down and the crowds stop cheering, and the \\r\\nbands stop playing, may it be said of our campaign that we kept the faith. May it be said of our Party in 1980 \\r\\nthat we found our faith again. And may it be said of us, both in \\r\\ndark passages and in bright days, in the words of Tennyson that my brothers \\r\\nquoted and loved, and that have special meaning for me now: \"I am a part of all that I \\r\\n\\t\\thave metTo [Tho] much is taken, much abidesThat which we are, we are --One equal temper of heroic heartsStrong in willTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\" For me, a few hours ago, this \\r\\ncampaign came to an end. For all those whose cares have been \\r\\nour concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the \\r\\ndream shall never die.',\n",
       " 'Honorable Chairman, Members of the Committee, ladies and gentlemen: It\\'s a great honor and a privilege to -- to appear before you this morning and to take advantage of the opportunity given me in our\\xa0free society to speak my mind, to give voice to my opinions in a public forum in front of not only the leadership of our great country, but the press and the media, and through them, all who might be listening around our country and around the world.Iam here to address the issue of a possible rating system in the Recording Industry, labeling records where excesses of explicit sex or graphic violence have occurred and, furthermore, references to drugs and alcohol or the occult are included in the lyrics.Thesehearings have been called to determine whether or not the Government should intervene to enforce this practice. Mr. Chairman, this would approach censorship. May I be very clear that I am strongly opposed to censorship of any kind in our society, or anywhere else in the world. I\\'ve had in my experience two encounters with th[is] sort of censorship. My song \"Rocky Mountain High\" was banned from many radio stations as a drug-related song. This was obviously done by people who had never seen or been to the Rocky Mountains and also had never experienced the elation, the celebration of life, or the joy in living that one feels when he observes something as wondrous as thePerseides meteor shower, on a moonless \\r\\n\\t\\tand cloudless night, when there are so many stars that you have a shadow from the starlight, and you\\'re out camping with your friends, your best friends, and introducing them to one of nature\\'s most spectacular light shows for the very first time.Obviously\\r\\na clear case of misinterpretation. Mr. Chairman, what assurance have I that any national panel to review my music would make any better judgment?To \\t\\t\\tmy knowledge, my movie \"Oh God!\" was not banned in any theaters. However, some newspapers refused to print our advertisements, and some theaters refused to put the name of the film on the marquee.I don\\'t believe that we were using the name of our Lord in vain. Quite the opposite, we were making a small effort to spread his message that we are here for each other and not against each other.Discipline and self-restraint, when practiced by an individual, a family, or a company is an effective way to deal with this issue. The same thing when forced on a people by their government or, worse, by a self-appointed watchdog of public morals, is suppression and will not be tolerated in a democratic society.Mr. Chairman, the suppression of the people of a society begins, in my mind, with the censorship of the written or spoken word. It was so in Nazi Germany. It is so in many places today where those in power are afraid of the consequences of an informed and educated people.In a matured and incredibly diverse society such as ours, the access to all perspectives of an issue becomes more and more important. Those things which in our experience are undesirable generally prove to be unfurthering and sooner or later become boring. That process cannot and should not be stifled.On the other hand, that which is denied becomes that which is most interesting. That which is hidden -- excuse me. That which is denied becomes that which is most desired, and that which is hidden becomes that which is most interesting. Consequently, a\\xa0 great deal of time and energy is spent trying to get at what is being kept from you. Our children, our people, our society and the world cannot afford this waste.It was my pleasure to meet with radio programmers and broadcasters from all over the country this past week in Dallas. They expressed their concern about this issue and the direction in which it seemed to be going. They also expressed their willingness to practice the discipline and self-restraint that I mentioned earlier, especially when they were given direction by their listeners. Now, I believe this to be true because they\\'re in business to please their listening audience. Frank Zappa\\'s Senate Opening Statement on Rock \\r\\n\\t\\tMusic Lyrics I would like to acknowledge thePMRCfor bringing this issue to the attention of not only our industry, but our Government and our people. It is obvious that we are dealing with a real problem which warrants our concern. I would like to point out, however, that we address ourselves not to the problem, but to the symptoms.I \\t\\t\\tsuggest that explicit lyrics and graphic videos are not so far removed from what is seen on television every day and night, whether it be in the soap operas or on the news. That we should point our finger at the Recording Industry while watching the general public at a nationally televised baseball game chant, in unison, \"The Blue Jays suck\" is ludicrous.The problem, Mr. Chairman, in my opinion, has to do with our willingness as parents to take responsibility for the upbringing of our children, to pay attention to their interests, to respond to their needs, and to recognize that we as parents and as individuals have a greater influence on our children and on each other than anything else could possibly have.To quote a wise old man from ancient China: \"If there be righteousness,\"\\xa0 not self-righteousness \\r\\n\\t\\t-- that\\'s is not part of the quote: If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character. If there be beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home. If there be harmony in the home, there will be order in the Nation. And if there be order in the Nation, there will be peace in the world.1 I thank you very much. Mr. Chairman \\r\\n\\t\\t-- excuse me -- if I may add a couple of personal words. I am a father of two children, both adopted. I have a lot of friends in the music business, other rock performers who have children also. And all of them, including myself, we have a great concern for our children. That\\'s -- That\\'s why I\\'m here today.In my experience, sir, all over the world, one of the most interesting things about the music that -- that young people are listening to is it gives us as adults a very clear insight as to what is going on in their minds. We can know what they are thinking by listening to the music that they surround themselves with.The people that I\\'ve had the opportunity to talk with, the troubled children, the teenagers who are considering suicide, what they expressed to me is a real frustration in their lives, an inability to communicate with their parents, an inability to understand or to envision any kind of a possible future because of the nuclear threat that we live under. They don\\'t see things getting better economically. They don\\'t see things getting better for the small businessman, for the small farmer. They do not see a future for themselves. It is my opinion that it is out of this that some young people put a gun into their mouths and pull the trigger. We can turn this around, sir. We can address the reality of a problem and not deal with just the symptoms, and create not only a better world for our children but for ourselves and all of humanity.We can end hunger. We can rid the world of nuclear weapons. We can learn to live together as human beings on a planet that travels through the universe, living the example of peace and harmony among all people.',\n",
       " 'Thank you \\r\\nvery much, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the White House and to this day to \\r\\nwhich Hillary and the vice president and I look forward so much every year. This is \\r\\nalways an important day for our country, for the reasons that the vice president \\r\\nsaid. It is an unusual and, I think, unusually important day today. I may not be \\r\\nquite as easy with my words today as I have been in years past, and I was up \\r\\nrather late last night thinking about and praying about what I ought to say \\r\\ntoday. And rather unusually for me, I actually tried to write it down. So if you \\r\\nwill forgive me, I will do my best to say what it is I want to say to you -- and \\r\\nI may have to take my glasses out to read my own writing. First, I \\r\\nwant to say to all of you that, as you might imagine, I have been on quite a \\r\\njourney these last few weeks to get to the end of this, to the rock bottom truth \\r\\nof where I am and where we all are. I agree with \\r\\nthose who have said that in my first statement, after I testified, I was not \\r\\ncontrite enough. I don\\'t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned. It is \\r\\nimportant to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is \\r\\ngenuine; first and most important, my family; also my friends, my staff, my \\r\\nCabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people. I have asked \\r\\nall for their forgiveness. But I \\r\\nbelieve that to be forgiven, more than sorrow is required -- at least two more \\r\\nthings. First, genuine repentance -- a determination to change and to repair \\r\\nbreaches of my own making. I have repented. Second, what my Bible calls a \\r\\n\\'\\'broken spirit\\'\\'; an understanding that I must have God\\'s help to be the person \\r\\nthat I want to be; a willingness to give the very forgiveness I seek; a \\r\\nrenunciation of the pride and the anger which cloud judgment, lead people to \\r\\nexcuse and compare, and to blame and complain. Now, what \\r\\ndoes all this mean for me and for us? First, I will instruct my lawyers to mount \\r\\na vigorous defense, using all available appropriate arguments. But legal \\r\\nlanguage must not obscure the fact that I have done wrong. Second, I will \\r\\ncontinue on the path of repentance, seeking pastoral support and theirs of other \\r\\n-- and that of other \\r\\ncaring people so that they can hold me accountable for my own commitment. Third, I \\r\\nwill intensify my efforts to lead our country and the world toward peace and \\r\\nfreedom, prosperity and harmony, in the hope that with a broken spirit and a \\r\\nstill strong heart I can be used for greater good -- for we have many blessings \\r\\nand many challenges and so much work to do. In this, I \\r\\nask for your prayers and for your help in healing our nation. And though I \\r\\ncannot move beyond or forget this -- indeed, I must always keep it as a caution \\r\\nlight in my life -- it is very important that our nation move forward. I am very \\r\\ngrateful for the many, many people -- clergy and ordinary citizens alike -- who \\r\\nhave written me with wise counsel. I am profoundly grateful for the support of \\r\\nso many Americans who somehow through it all seem to still know that I care \\r\\nabout them a great deal, that I care about their problems and their dreams. I am \\r\\ngrateful for those who have stood by me and who say that in this case and many \\r\\nothers, the bounds of privacy have been excessively and unwisely invaded. That \\r\\nmay be. Nevertheless, in this case, it may be a blessing, because I still \\r\\nsinned. And if my repentance is genuine and sustained, and if I can maintain \\r\\nboth a broken spirit and a strong heart, then good can come of this for our \\r\\ncountry as well as for me and my family. I -- The children \\r\\nof this country can learn in a profound way that integrity is important and \\r\\nselfishness is wrong, but God can change us and make us strong at the broken \\r\\nplaces. I want to embody those lessons for the children of this country -- for \\r\\nthat little boy in Florida who came up to me and said that he wanted to grow up \\r\\nand be President and to be just like me. I want the parents of all the children \\r\\nin America to be able to say that to their children. A couple of \\r\\ndays ago when I was in Florida a Jewish friend of mine gave me this liturgy book \\r\\ncalled \\'\\'Gates of Repentance.\\'\\' And there was this incredible passage from theYom Kippur liturgy. I would like to read it to you: Now \\r\\n\\tis the time for turning. The leaves are beginning to turn from green to red \\r\\n\\tto orange. The birds are beginning to turn and are heading once more toward \\r\\n\\tthe south. The animals are beginning to turn to storing their food for the \\r\\n\\twinter. For leaves, birds and animals, turning comes instinctively. But for \\r\\n\\tus, turning does not come so easily. It takes an act of will for us to make \\r\\n\\ta turn. It means breaking old habits. It means admitting that we have been \\r\\n\\twrong, and this is never easy. It means losing face. It means starting all \\r\\n\\tover again. And this is always painful. It means saying \\'I am sorry\\'. It means \\r\\n\\trecognizing that we have the ability to change. These things are terribly \\r\\n\\thard to do. But unless we turn, we will be trapped forever in yesterday\\'s \\r\\n\\tways. Lord help us to turn, from callousness to sensitivity, from hostility \\r\\n\\tto love, from pettiness to purpose, from envy to contentment, from \\r\\n\\tcarelessness to discipline, from fear to faith. Turn us around, O\\' Lord, and \\r\\n\\tbring us back toward you. Revive our lives as at the beginning, and turn us \\r\\n\\ttoward each other, Lord, for in isolation there is no life. I thank my \\r\\nfriend for that. I thank you for being here. I ask you to share my prayer that \\r\\nGod will \"search me and know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts; see \\r\\nif there is any hurtfulness in me, and lead me toward the life everlasting.\"1 I \\r\\nask that God give me a clean heart. Let me \"walk by faith and not sight.\"2 I ask once \\r\\nagain to be able to love my neighbor -- all my neighbors -- as my self,3to be an \\r\\ninstrument of God\\'s peace; to \"let the words of my mouth and the meditations of \\r\\nmy heart\"4and, in the end, the work of my hands, be pleasing. This is what I \\r\\nwanted to say to you today. Thank you. \\r\\nGod bless you.',\n",
       " \"The United War Work campaign, \\r\\nwhich is asking the American people to contribute not less than $170,500,000, is \\r\\nthe greatest voluntary altruistic endeavor the world has ever known.\\xa0 For the \\r\\nfirst time in history, people of Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant faith are \\r\\nstanding side by side and working in closest cooperation for a great common \\r\\ncause. The seven organizations \\r\\nincluded in the campaign -- namely, the Young Men's Christian Association, the \\r\\nYoung Women's Christian Association, the National Catholic War Council, the \\r\\nJewish Welfare Board, the War Camp Community Service, the American Library \\r\\nAssociation, and the Salvation Army - are authorized by the Secretary of War and \\r\\nthe Secretary of the Navy to work for the soldiers and sailors in and near the \\r\\ncamps. Since talk of peace has been \\r\\ncurrent during the past few weeks, the question has arisen in the minds of many \\r\\nas to whether this great fund of $170,500,000 will be needed in the event of an \\r\\nearly termination of the war.\\xa0 The answer is that the sooner the war ends, the \\r\\nmore vital will be the need for this fund -- every dollar of it, and as much \\r\\nmore as the generosity of the American people will provide. Our men in uniform are like the \\r\\ncollege football players.\\xa0 While the struggle is impending, they are observing \\r\\nthe rules of training that they may be fit to fight, but when the game has been \\r\\nwon the temptation to break training and make up for the restraint of the past \\r\\nmonths and years will be a mighty one. At the best, it will take many \\r\\nmonths to bring home the men now overseas, and a still longer time to absorb \\r\\ninto civil life this great army.\\xa0 During these days and weeks and months of \\r\\ncomparative idleness, relaxation, inactivity, and waiting, they will need as \\r\\nnever since the day they entered the service the friendship, inspiration, \\r\\noccupation, amusement, and strength which these organizations alone can provide. Do you want to see the flower \\r\\nof the manhood of this country, which has brought everlasting glory to our \\r\\nnation, neglected in the hour of its greatest need, and afraid to face \\r\\ntemptation?\\xa0 Then withhold your contribution to this fund.

       " 'Prime Minister Rabin; Chairman Arafat; Your Majesty,King Hussein; \\r\\nPresident Mubarak; Foreign Minister Peres; Mr. Abu Mazin; Prime Ministers \\r\\nGonzalez, Filali, Bin Shakir; Foreign Minister Kozyrev, our cosponsor of the \\r\\nMiddle East peace negotiations; distinguished foreign ministers and members of \\r\\nthe Diplomatic Corps; and honored guests: I welcome you to \\r\\nthe White House for this milestone on the path to reconciliation. Today we make \\r\\na great stride for the fulfillment of a vision toward the day when two \\r\\npeoples divided by generations, by conflict, are bound now by peace. Finally, \\r\\nthe time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel\\'s house, when the \\r\\nPalestinian people will write their own destiny, when the clash of arms will be \\r\\nbanished from God\\'s Holy Land. Two years ago, \\r\\non another brilliant September day here at the White House, two men reached \\r\\nacross one of history\\'s widest chasms with a simple handshake.That moment is \\r\\netched forever in our memory. With the eyes of the world upon you, Mr. Prime \\r\\nMinister [Rabin], you declared your wish to live side by side with the Palestinian \\r\\npeople in dignity, in empathy, as human beings, as free men. And you, Mr. \\r\\nChairman [Arafat], vowed to wage what you called the most difficult battle of our lives, \\r\\nthe battle for peace. In the days of \\r\\nlabor that have followed, you have both shown profound courage in bringing us to \\r\\nthis moment -- and you have kept your word. The enemies of \\r\\npeace have fought the tide of history with terror and violence. We grieve for \\r\\ntheir victims, and we renew our vow to redeem the sacrifice of those victims. We \\r\\nwill defeat those who resort to terror. And we revere the determination of \\r\\nthese leaders who chose peace, who rejected the old habits of hatred and \\r\\nrevenge. Because they broke so bravely with the past, the bridges have \\r\\nmultiplied -- bridges of communication, of commerce, of understanding. Today, the \\r\\nlandscape changes and the chasm narrows. The agreement \\r\\nthat now will be signed means that Israel\\'s mothers and fathers need no longer \\r\\nworry that their sons will face the dangers of patrollingNablusor confronting \\r\\nthe hostile streets ofRamallah. And it means that Palestinians will be able to \\r\\ndecide for themselves what their schools teach, how their houses should be \\r\\nbuilt, and who they will choose to govern. You, the \\r\\nchildren of Abraham, have made a peace worthy of your great forebear. Abraham, \\r\\npatriarch of both Arabs and Jews, sacrificed power for peace when he said to his \\r\\nnephew, Lot, \"Let there be no strife between thee and me. If thou will take the \\r\\nleft hand, then I will go to the right.\"1Patience and persistence, courage and \\r\\nsacrifice: These are the virtues, then as now, that set peacemakers apart. Mr. Prime \\r\\nMinister, Mr. Chairman, you are showing that it is not by weapons, but by \\r\\nwill and by word, that dreams best become reality. Your achievement shines as \\r\\nan inspiration to others all around this world who seek to overcome their own \\r\\nconflicts and to secure for themselves the blessings of peace. Chapter by \\r\\nchapter, Jews and Arabs are writing a new history for their ancient lands:Camp \\r\\nDavid; theDeclaration of Principles, signed here 2 years ago; thepeace of the Aravalast year between Jordan and Israel: With each of these, the truth of this \\r\\nbook has become clear to the world. As courageous leaders stepped beyond the \\r\\nbounds of convention, they build for their peoples a new world of hope and \\r\\npeace. Now, as this new \\r\\nchapter begins, it is fitting that we are joined by so many from the camp of \\r\\npeace. Egypt\\'s President Mubarak has carried forth the commitment to peace that \\r\\nbegan withAnwar el-Sadatand themiracle at Camp David. Before there was a \\r\\nglimpse of a breakthrough, President Mubarak stood for reconciliation. And he \\r\\nadded his strength, his personal strength, time and time again in the days of \\r\\nthe negotiations. Almost a year \\r\\nago, on the border that had known only barbed wire and armed patrols, King \\r\\nHussein and Prime Minister Rabin brought their nations together in peace. \\r\\nAlready that border has been transformed, as have the lives of Israelis and \\r\\nJordanians, after 46 years as enemies. King Hussein stands as a rock on which \\r\\npeace can be built. In only a few weeks, he will host the economicsummit in \\r\\nAmman2that will bring together Israelis and Arabs from throughout the region, \\r\\nbusiness and government leaders from throughout the world, to map the promise of \\r\\ntomorrow. Today we are \\r\\nalso joined by the largest group of Arab foreign ministers ever assembled to \\r\\nsupport the growth of peace. Prime Minister Filali of Morocco has traveled here \\r\\nto represent King Hassan, who has done so much to advance progress in the \\r\\nregion. With us as well are representatives of nations that have provided vital \\r\\nsupport for peace, including the countries of the European Union, Japan, Canada, \\r\\nand of course, Norway, whose assistance two years ago opened the way to this \\r\\nmoment. All those who \\r\\ndoubt the spirit of peace should remember this day and this extraordinary array \\r\\nof leaders who have joined together to bring a new era of hope to the Middle \\r\\nEast. The United States is proud to stand with all of them. Much remains to \\r\\nbe done. But we will continue to walk each step of the way with those who work \\r\\nand risk for peace. We will press forward with our efforts until the circle of \\r\\npeace is closed, a circle which must include Syria and Lebanon if peace is to be \\r\\ncomplete. We will not rest until Muslims and Jews can turn their backs to pray \\r\\nwithout any fear; until all the region\\'s children can grow up untouched by \\r\\nconflict, until the shadow of violence is lifted from the land of light and \\r\\ngold. Thank you very \\r\\nmuch. As we adjourn, \\r\\nlet me once again thank all of our guests from across the world who have come \\r\\nhere to be a part of this and to wish all the parties well. Let me thank those \\r\\nwho spoke today for their contributions to the peace process.s. Let me say a \\r\\nspecial word of thanks to the members of Congress who have come here from both \\r\\nparties, including both Jewish-Americans and Arab-Americans represented in our \\r\\nUnited States Congress, for their support of the United States\\' effort. And let me close \\r\\nwith this simple thought: As the cold war has given way to a global village in \\r\\nwhich the enemies of peace are many and dispersed all across the world, the \\r\\nUnited States is -- the United States is honored and obligated to be a force for peace, from Northern \\r\\nIreland to Southern Africa, from Bosnia to Haiti, to reducing the nuclear threat \\r\\nand the threat of biological and chemical weapons to fighting against terrorism \\r\\nand organized crime. But this is \\r\\nspecial. For it is in this place that those of us who believe that the world was \\r\\ncreated by, is looked over by, and ultimately will be accountable to one great \\r\\nGod. All of us came from there, whether we find that wisdom in the Torah or the \\r\\nKoran or the Christian Holy Bible. If we could all learn in that place to find \\r\\nthe secret of peace, then perhaps the dream of peace on Earth can truly be \\r\\nrealized. Thank you, and \\r\\nGod bless you all.',\n",
       " 'WhenJohn Glennwas 10 years old, his \\r\\n\\t\\tfather, his hero, a veteran of World War I, taught him how to play \"Taps\" on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe bugle. They\\'d play together on Memorial Day inNew Concord[Ohio], small flags \\r\\n\\t\\tand flowers next to gravesites -- gravestones of the fallen. AndJohn would recallthat time and feeling when he said, where \"Love of country was a given. \\r\\n\\t\\tDefense of its ideals was an obligation.\" And, \"The opportunity to join in \\r\\n\\t\\tits [quests] and explorations was a challenge not only to fulfill a \\r\\n\\t\\tsacred duty but to join a joyous adventure.1 With John, all the years I \\r\\n\\t\\tknew him and worked with him was always a joyous adventure. Annie, what a joyous \\r\\n\\t\\tadventure you and John had together, on display for your children and the \\r\\n\\t\\twhole world to see. You all know it. You can tell when a couple really, \\r\\n\\t\\tgenuinely loves and enjoys one another. It was infectious. On behalf of President Obama and the First \\r\\n\\t\\tLady, on behalf of the American people, Jill and I are here because we \\r\\n\\t\\tlove you Annie, and we loved John. And together you taught us all how to love. That\\'s not something you usually talk about when you talk about heroes, \\r\\n\\t\\tespecially heroes like John Glenn, who lived a life that was rigorous but \\r\\n\\t\\ttinged with just a little bit of magic. Just a little bit of magic. We \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk about daring spirit, poise under pressure, mental and physical \\r\\n\\t\\ttoughness, but for all his heroism that history will remember in war, in \\r\\n\\t\\tspace, in public life, you felt something deeper with John.  Annie, on the way \\r\\n\\t\\tto get toAir Force 2, I got a call fromJohn Kerry, who\\'s somewhere over the \\r\\n\\t\\tAtlantic on the way to another mission in the Middle East to try to deal \\r\\n\\t\\twith Yemen. And he told me about his time he got to spend with you a \\r\\n\\t\\tcouple days ago, and the family. He pointed out, he said, \"Joe, you know John\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tonly the ninth person in history in the state of Ohio to everlie in state. \"Governor, I \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t know that.\" Only the ninth in history.  And he talked \\r\\n\\t\\tabout how much it meant to him to be with you. And he gave, \\r\\n\\t\\tspontaneously, what I think is maybe the best description of John Glenn \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve ever heard -- and I new John for 40 years. He said, \"John came out of the heart \\r\\n\\t\\tof the country\" -- like you kids do -- \"and he stole America\\'s heart.\" \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Came out \\r\\n\\t\\tof the heart of the country and he stole America\\'s heart.\" And he did: He \\r\\n\\t\\tstole America\\'s heart.  I remember as a kid, freshman in college,John\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\thistoric flight. And Annie, you and John and Jill and I have been friends for \\r\\n\\t\\t40 years. I know others have longer relationships but what a wonderful 40 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears it has been. We served in the Senate together side-by-side for 25 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, and we traveled around the world together. John was one of the \\r\\n\\t\\thappiest people I ever knew. Think about it -- one of the happiest \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople I ever knew. He had that infectious smile. Even when things looked \\r\\n\\t\\tlike everything was crashing down, John would walk into my office or walk \\r\\n\\t\\tinto a \\r\\n\\t\\tcaucus with that big smile on his face and I wondered, \"Where in the hell has he \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen?\" \"Did he not just hear what I just heard?\" (You think I\\'m kidding. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not \\r\\n\\t\\tkidding.) But the world knew, [revered], and respected \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn, from Columbus to \\r\\n\\t\\tCambodia, from Washington to Beijing. He loved being a senator. He loved \\r\\n\\t\\this constituents and his colleagues. He loved his staff, many of whom are \\r\\n\\t\\there today. And, boy, did they love him back. And you could feel his love for \\r\\n\\t\\this country and for his state and for the Marine Corps. He was kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tpartial to NASA. But most especially you felt his love for you, Annie, \\r\\n\\t\\tand for Dave and Lyn, and his grandchildren. All you had to do, as I said, \\r\\n\\t\\twas see John and Annie just walk together, just the way they looked at each \\r\\n\\t\\tother, and you knew that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to be like. I said that to Annie today before we came in and she said, \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Well, that\\'s like you and Jill.\" \\r\\n\\t\\tI said, \"No it\\'s different. Everybody knows I love Jill more than she loves \\r\\n\\t\\tme. I think you, [Annie], loved him just as much. The last time we were together, when \\r\\n\\t\\tJill and I had Annie and John over to the Vice President\\'s residence -- I was looking at the picture this morning, Annie, of you guys walking \\r\\n\\t\\tdown the steps, walking out to the gate, and Jill and I behind you. And the \\r\\n\\t\\twords of the poet Christopher Marlowe literally came to mind, and I had \\r\\n\\t\\tto rewrite this on the way to the plane. Christopher Marlowe said: \"Come \\r\\n\\t\\twith me and be my love and all the pleasures we shall prove.\"2 Well, together, Annie, you and John proved all the pleasures. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou not \\r\\n\\t\\tonly had a magical love affair -- the other thing about you, you were partners. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou were[unclear]partners. Together, you bore the \\r\\n\\t\\tway to fame and responsibility and with enormous humility, and a sense \\r\\n\\t\\tof duty that defined you as the greatest ofAmerica\\'s greatest generation. I think John defined what it meant to be America, what \\r\\n\\t\\tit meant to be an \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican, what we were about -- just by how he acted. Always about \\r\\n\\t\\tpromise. We were a country of possibilities, opportunity. Always a belief \\r\\n\\t\\tin tomorrow. Tomorrow. When John was at the house a couple years ago it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tall he kept talking about: \"What are you going do now, Joe?\" \"What are we \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to do tomorrow?\" \"We have all these opportunities.\" Together, you and John \\r\\n\\t\\ttaught us that a good life is built not on a single historic \\r\\n\\t\\tact -- or multiple acts -- of heroism, but a thousand little things; the thousand \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle things that build character, treating everyone with dignity and \\r\\n\\t\\trespect John was one of the few of my colleagues \\r\\n\\t\\twho would be going to the restroom where there was a shoeshine guy. John \\r\\n\\t\\twould always pat him on the shoulder and give him a hug, understanding that \\r\\n\\t\\tdespite fame and position everybody was John\\'s equal. Everybody was John\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tequal -- in his mind. And it all comes down to being personal. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe President \\r\\n\\t\\talways kids me, Annie, because I\\'m getting older, now. I could even try to \\r\\n\\t\\timprove onTip O\\'Neill\\'s admonition about \"all politics is local.\" I don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tthink John agreed with that either. I think, and I think he thought, all \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics ispersonal. It\\'s all personal. It all comes down to being personal \\r\\n\\t\\t-- to being there \\r\\n\\t\\tfor family, and being there for friends, in good times and in bad times; \\r\\n\\t\\tlike you and John were there for me and Jill when I was in the hospital. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou \\r\\n\\t\\twere there for us when our son,Beau, was deployed and you were therewhen we \\r\\n\\t\\tburied him. It\\'s all about being personal. Annie, you and John, as was \\r\\n\\t\\tmentioned earlier by the first speaker, were with Ethel [Kennedy]. I happened to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe withEthel Kennedyat an awards ceremony in New York, thelittle ripple of \\r\\n\\t\\thopeceremony. And, ironically, a fellow who runs my office, \\r\\n\\t\\twho\\'s a Ohio guy, \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid John \"wasn\\'t doing well.\" \"You ought to call John.\"\\xa0 And I had a brief \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscussion with Ethyl as I sat with her. And the story is well known about \\r\\n\\t\\thim talking to the kids, being sent back toHickory Hill. But what struck me was \\r\\n\\t\\tI was told that when you and John got to Hickory Hill, John walked into \\r\\n\\t\\tSenator [Robert] Kennedy\\'s private study and saw that Robert Kennedy, who was the \\r\\n\\t\\tonly political[uncertain]I ever had in my life, had out a book of Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s poetry. And it was opened up, and in a leaf of the book, \\r\\n\\t\\tthere in the margins, were comments made by Robert Kennedy. And the passage that \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn, I\\'m told, remembered was where Emerson said, \"This time, like all times, is a very \\r\\n\\t\\tgood one, if we but know what to do with it.\"3 The thing that I liked most about John \\r\\n\\t\\twas he knew from his upbringing that ordinary Americans can do \\r\\n\\t\\textraordinary things. Ordinary Americans could do extraordinary things. And he \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieved, I believe, he was confident that every successive generation would know what to do with it. And that\\'s the charge \\r\\n\\t\\tI \\r\\n\\t\\tthink John left us, Annie: to join our nation\\'s conquests and our nation\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\texplorations as a challenge, not only to fulfill a sacred duty, but to \\r\\n\\t\\tjoin in this joyous adventure. So when the Marine plays \"Taps\" on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe bugle at Arlington for our friend, we can look deep into the heavens \\r\\n\\t\\tand know with certitude that John believed -- and was right -- that future generations of Americans \\r\\n\\t\\twill also look deep within the heavens and understand how to explore, how \\r\\n\\t\\tto serve, how to love; and will come to understand that if we\\'re looking for \\r\\n\\t\\ta message to send about our time here on earth, for what it means to be \\r\\n\\t\\tan American: It\\'s the life of John Glenn. And that is not hyperbole. So, God \\r\\n\\t\\tbless you, John. God bless you, Annie. And may God protect our troops. ',\n",
       " ' This is a very moving moment to honor someone whose life and work truly exemplify the meaning of \\x93search for common ground.\\x94 And I greatly appreciate everyone who has supported this organization and its mission over a number of years, John Marks and Susan Collin Marks, my longtime friend Ambassador George Moose, members of the Diplomatic Corps, and supporters of Search for Common Ground. I also want to congratulate all of tonight\\x92s honorees. It\\x92s a special privilege and honor to have Chris\\x92s sister Anne with us tonight. This has been for everyone a very difficult, personal ordeal. But of course, for Chris\\x92s family, it has been so much more. They grieve and they remember. And they have shown such grace and dignity in the weeks since they were thrust into the harsh spotlight of history. In the rush of headlines, it is easy to forget that at the center of this national tragedy was such a real person, with passion and principles, with humor and irony, with ambition and humility, with friends and colleagues and loved ones. Chris Stevenswas a son of the West. He hiked and jogged and danced his way through the hills and forests of northern California, and then he did it in Libya. He loved the cool, refreshing fog of the Bay Area, the sight of the Golden Gate, and the warm embrace of his family. But his family gave him not only roots but wings. And he shared the restless soul of the frontier. His mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, always moving and running and working, seeking out new challenges and adventures. And there was music in his life. The son of a cellist, he himself played the saxophone, which, of course, for me. Friends in Jerusalem remember his passion for Palestinian songs, as he would serenade them in Arabic. When Chris first took the Foreign Service exam in college, he was asked to compare American democracy with the freewheeling energy of jazz. One of his closest friends, Steve McDonald, remembers spending hours discussing the question, about experimentation and improvisation, about the relationship between a brilliant soloist and a band that all have to pull together to achieve harmony. Later, Steve would come to think of Chris as a jazz diplomat. That really resonates with anyone who ever worked with or knew Chris, who saw his creativity and inspiration up close. Jazz musicians like to talk about playing the changes. Their art lies in the space between structure and spontaneity. Yes, they do master the technique, but then they begin to improvise. And that is how Chris worked. A young Foreign Service officer who was with him in Libya marveled at Chris\\x92s appetite for history and culture. He stayed up late reading memoirs of former Libyan leaders and delighted in sharing obscure historical trivia and cracking jokes not just in Arabic but in the local dialect. Other colleagues remember his endless patience and talent for listening, two characteristics that really are required to be a successful diplomat. As one of Chris\\x92s friends explained recently, you develop a relationship and a personal connection, and a series of connections become a network. Many Americans, well, we start at A and work down the list to F. But A to B is not a straight line, and Chris had an instinctive feel for this, how to get things done. He understood not just the science of diplomacy but the art. He heard the music and the words. And he was committed to his mission of helping others find their own freedom. He found a second home amidst the shifting deserts and crowded cities of the Middle East. He climbed the Atlas Mountains, he wandered through Syrian souks, he jogged through Libyan olive groves. And he had so many moments of common ground. When the revolution broke out in Libya, I asked Chris to travel to Benghazi. And he did so on a Greek cargo ship, like a 19th century envoy. It certainly appealed to his romantic side. But his work was very much 21st century hardnosed diplomacy and relationship building. Even when a bomb exploded in the parking lot of the hotel where he was staying, he never wavered. Chris would have been the first to say that the terrorists who attacked our mission in Benghazi on September 11th did not represent the millions of Libyans who want peace and deplore violence. You saw and you heard the President\\x92s inspired and inspiring words about that. Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremist arguments that violence and death are the only way to reclaim dignity and achieve justice. He understood that\\x92s why he was in Libya, and there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls, building relationships, and finding common ground. He also knew that when America is absent, especially from the dangerous places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, our interests suffer, and our security at home is threatened. The State Department sends people to more than 275 posts in 170 countries around the world. Chris understood that diplomats must operate in many places where soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and security is far from guaranteed. And he volunteered for those kinds of assignments. He understood that we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security in this world, and that our diplomats cannot work in bunkers and do their jobs, that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country, a country we love, and to advance our interests and values. Of course, it is also our responsibility to constantly improve, to reduce the risks our people face, to make sure they have the resources they need to do what we ask of them. And nobody takes that more seriously than I do, and the security professionals at the State Department. We now have a formal Accountability Review Board investigating the terrorist attack that killed Chris, and we will certainly apply its recommendations and lessons learned to improving security everywhere. It\\x92s appropriate that we do so based on facts and evidence. Chris\\x92s family, his colleagues at the Department, and the American people deserve nothing less. As that process moves forward, though, we are taking immediate steps to bolster security and readiness. We\\x92ve dispatched teams, joint teams from the Department of State and Defense, to review high-threat posts to determine whether there are other improvements we need in light of the evolving security challenges we now face. The men and women who serve our country overseas represent the best traditions of a bold and generous nation, and they are no strangers to danger. From Tehran and Beirut to Islamabad, East Africa, and Saudi Arabia, and now in Benghazi, and many other places in between over the years, we have seen our diplomats devoted to peace targeted by terrorists devoted to death. But we cannot, indeed we must not, be intimidated. We have to remain focused and clear in our vision of the kind of world we seek to build. Chris Stevens was an inspiration to all who served with him and knew him during his life. He remains an inspiration now and I believe far into the future, because he exemplified the best of what we stand for, who we are as a people. And he believed in the search for common ground. So we thank you for recognizing this brave and good man, this consummate diplomat, this American hero. And now please join me in welcoming Anne Stevens to the stage.',\n",
       " 'Thank you all very much. I -- I am so \\r\\n\\t\\thonored to be here tonight. You know, I -- I\\'m here tonight as a proud \\r\\n\\t\\tmother, as a proud democrat, as a proud Senator from New York, a proud \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican, and a proud supporter of Barack Obama. My friends, it is time to take back the \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry we love. And whether you voted for me or you voted for Barack, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe time is now to unite as a single Party with a single purpose. We are \\r\\n\\t\\ton the same team, and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines. \\r\\n\\t\\tThis is a fight for the future and it\\'s a fight we must win together. I haven\\'t spent the past 35 years in the \\r\\n\\t\\ttrenches -- I haven\\'t spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating \\r\\n\\t\\tfor children, campaigning for universal health care, helping parents \\r\\n\\t\\tbalance work and family, andfighting for women\\'s rights here at home and around the worldto see another Republican in the White House squander our promise of a \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry that really fulfills the hopes of our people. And you haven\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tworked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years \\r\\n\\t\\tto suffer through more failed leadership. No way, no how, no McCain. Barack Obama is my candidate, and he must be \\r\\n\\t\\tour President. Tonight, I ask you to remember what a \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you, the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople, and your lives and your children\\'s\\' futures. For me, it\\'s been a privilege to meet you in your \\r\\n\\t\\thomes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me \\r\\n\\t\\tthat every day America\\'s greatness is bound up in the lives of the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican people. Your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for \\r\\n\\t\\tyour children, and your determination to keep going -- often in the face \\r\\n\\t\\tof enormous obstacles -- you taught me so much. And you made me laugh, \\r\\n\\t\\tand, yes, you even made my cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives, \\r\\n\\t\\tand you became part of mine. I will always remember the single mom who \\r\\n\\t\\thad adopted two kids with autism. She didn\\'t have any health insurance; \\r\\n\\t\\tand she discovered that she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald \\r\\n\\t\\thead, painted with my name on it, and asked me to fight for health care \\r\\n\\t\\tfor her and her children. I will always remember the young man in a \\r\\n\\t\\tMarine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care, and he said to \\r\\n\\t\\tme, \"Take care of my buddies. A lot of them are still over there.\" And \\r\\n\\t\\tthen, \"Will you please take care of me.\" And I will always remember the young boy who \\r\\n\\t\\ttold me his mom worked for the minimum wage, that her employer had cut \\r\\n\\t\\ther hours. He said he just didn\\'t know what his family was going to do. I will always be grateful for everyone from \\r\\n\\t\\tall 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Territories, who joined our campaign \\r\\n\\t\\ton behalf of all those people left our and left behind by the Bush \\r\\n\\t\\tAdministration. To my supporters, to my champions, so my \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pant Suits,\" from the bottom of my heart -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthank you. Thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up. And together we made history, and along the \\r\\n\\t\\tway America lost two great democratic champions who would have been here \\r\\n\\t\\twith us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas democratic \\r\\n\\t\\tchair,Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his \\r\\n\\t\\theart that America and the South should be democratic from top to \\r\\n\\t\\tbottom; and CongresswomanStephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of us -- a loving mother, a courageous leader who never gave up her \\r\\n\\t\\tquest to make America fairer and stronger, smarter and better; steadfast \\r\\n\\t\\tin her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to \\r\\n\\t\\tme and to us all. Our heart goes out to Stephanie\\'s son, Mervyn Jr., and \\r\\n\\t\\tBill\\'s wife, Rebecca, who traveled here to Denver to join this family of \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrats. You know, Bill Gwatney and Stephanie Tubbs \\r\\n\\t\\tJones knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at \\r\\n\\t\\thome; and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of \\r\\n\\t\\twork ahead of us: jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices, \\r\\n\\t\\ta Supreme Court in a right-wing headlock, and our government in partisan \\r\\n\\t\\tgridlock; the biggest deficit in our nation\\'s history, money borrowed \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis; Putin and Georgia, Iran and \\r\\n\\t\\tIraq. I ran for President to renew the promise of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica, to rebuild the middle-class and sustain the American Dream, to \\r\\n\\t\\tprovide opportunity to those who are willing to work hard for it and \\r\\n\\t\\thave that work rewarded; so they could save for college, a home, and \\r\\n\\t\\tretirement; afford gas and groceries and have a little left over each \\r\\n\\t\\tmonth; to promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of \\r\\n\\t\\tgreen collar jobs; to create a health care system that is universal, \\r\\n\\t\\thigh quality and affordable, so that every single parent knows their \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren will be taken care of. We want to create a world-class education \\r\\n\\t\\tsystem, and make college affordable again; to fight for an America that \\r\\n\\t\\tis defined by deep and meaningful equality -- from civil rights to labor \\r\\n\\t\\trights, from women\\'s rights to gay rights; from ending discrimination to \\r\\n\\t\\tpromoting unionization; to providing help for the most important job \\r\\n\\t\\tthere is: caring for our families; and to help every child live up to \\r\\n\\t\\this or her God-given potential; to make America once again a nation of \\r\\n\\t\\timmigrants and of laws; to restore fiscal sanity to Washington, and to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake our Government an institution of the public good, not of private \\r\\n\\t\\tplunder; to restore America\\'s standing the world, to end the war in \\r\\n\\t\\tIraq, bring our troops home with honor, care for our veterans and given \\r\\n\\t\\tthem the services they have earned. We will work for an America \\r\\n\\t\\tagain that will join with our allies in confronting our shared \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming. Most of all, I ran to stand \\r\\n\\t\\tup for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight \\r\\n\\t\\tlong years. Those are the reasons I ran for President, and those are the \\r\\n\\t\\treasons I support Barack Obama for President. I want you -- I want you to ask \\r\\n\\t\\tyourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for \\r\\n\\t\\tthat young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom \\r\\n\\t\\tstruggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for \\r\\n\\t\\tall the people in this country who feel invisible? We need leaders once again \\r\\n\\t\\twho can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges \\r\\n\\t\\t-- leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our \\r\\n\\t\\tingenuity, creativity and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what \\r\\n\\t\\tis possible in America. Now, this will not be easy. \\r\\n\\t\\tProgress never is. But it will be impossible if we don\\'t fight to put a \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrat back into the White House. We need to elect Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tObama because we need a President who understands that America can\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tcompete in the global economy by padding the pockets of energy \\r\\n\\t\\tspeculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped \\r\\n\\t\\toverseas. We need a President who understands we can\\'t solve the \\r\\n\\t\\tproblems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil \\r\\n\\t\\tcompanies while ignoring opportunities to invest in the new technologies \\r\\n\\t\\tthat will build a green economy. We need a President who \\r\\n\\t\\tunderstands that the genius of America has always depended on the \\r\\n\\t\\tstrength and vitality of the middle class. Barack Obama began his \\r\\n\\t\\tcareer fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built \\r\\n\\t\\this campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must \\r\\n\\t\\tstart from the ground up, not the top down. And he knows that government must \\r\\n\\t\\tbe about \"We the people\" -- not \"We the favored few.\" And when Barack Obama is in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe White House, he\\'ll revitalize our economy, defend the working people \\r\\n\\t\\tof America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know \\r\\n\\t\\thow to do this. As I recall, we did it before with President Clinton and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Democrats. And if we do our part, we\\'ll do it again with President \\r\\n\\t\\tObama and the Democrats. Just think of what America \\r\\n\\t\\twill be as we transform our energy economy, create those millions of  \\r\\n\\t\\tjobs, build a strong base for economic growth and shared prosperity, get middle class families \\r\\n\\t\\tget the tax relief they deserve. And I cannot wait to watch Barack Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tsign into law a health care plan that covers every single American. And we know that President \\r\\n\\t\\tObama will end the war in Iraq responsibly, bring our troops home, and \\r\\n\\t\\tbegin to repair our alliances around the world. And Barack will have with \\r\\n\\t\\thim a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw\\r\\n\\t\\tMichelle\\'s speech last night \\r\\n\\t\\tknows she will be a great First Lady for America. And Americans are fortunate \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama\\'s side -- a strong leader, a good \\r\\n\\t\\tman, who understands both the economic stresses here at home and the \\r\\n\\t\\tstrategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic; he\\'s tough; and he\\'s wise. And, \\r\\n\\t\\tJoe, of \\r\\n\\t\\tcourse, will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill. They will be \\r\\n\\t\\ta great team for our country. Now, John McCain is my \\r\\n\\t\\tcolleague and my friend. He has served our country with honor and \\r\\n\\t\\tcourage. But we don\\'t need four more years of the last eight years: more \\r\\n\\t\\teconomic stagnation and less affordable health care; more high gas \\r\\n\\t\\tprices and less alternative energy; more jobs getting shipped overseas \\r\\n\\t\\tand fewer jobs created here at home; more skyrocketing debt and home \\r\\n\\t\\tforeclosures and mounting bills that are crushing middle class \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies; more war and less diplomacy; more of a government where the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivileged come first and everyone else comes last. Well, John McCain says the \\r\\n\\t\\teconomy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn\\'t think 47 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants \\r\\n\\t\\tto privatize Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it\\'s okay when \\r\\n\\t\\twomen don\\'t earn equal pay for equal work. Now, with an agenda like \\r\\n\\t\\tthat, it makes perfect sense that George Bush and John McCain will be \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether next week in the Twin Cities -- because these days they\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tawfully hard to tell apart. You know, America is still \\r\\n\\t\\taround after 232 years because we have risen to every challenge and \\r\\n\\t\\tevery new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity for all and the common good. And I know what that can mean \\r\\n\\t\\tfor every man, woman, and child in America. I\\'m a United States Senator \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered \\r\\n\\t\\tinSeneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to \\r\\n\\t\\tparticipate in the first convention on women\\'s rights in our history. And so dawned a struggle for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughter to granddaughter -- and a few sons and grandsons along the way. \\r\\n\\t\\tThese women and men looked into their daughters\\' eyes and imagined a \\r\\n\\t\\tfairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight, to rally, to \\r\\n\\t\\tpicket, to endure ridicule and harassment, and brave violence and jail. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd after so many decades -- 88 years ago on this very day -- the 19th \\r\\n\\t\\tamendment giving women the right to vote became enshrined in our \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitution. My mother was born before \\r\\n\\t\\twomen could vote. My daughter got to vote for her mother for President. \\r\\n\\t\\tThis is the story of America, of women and men who defy the odds and never give up. So how do we give this country \\r\\n\\t\\tback to them? By following the example of \\r\\n\\t\\ta brave New Yorker, a woman who risked her lives [sic] to bring slaves along \\r\\n\\t\\ttheUnderground Railroad. On that path to freedom,Harriet Tubmanhad \\r\\n\\t\\tone piece of advice: If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the \\r\\n\\t\\ttorches in the woods, keep going. If they\\'re shouting after you, keep \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing. Don\\'t ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing. And even in the darkest of moments, that is what Americans have \\r\\n\\t\\tdone. We have found the faith to keep going. I\\'ve seen it. I have seen it \\r\\n\\t\\tin our teachers and our firefighters, our police officers, our nurses, \\r\\n\\t\\tour small \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness owners and our union workers. I\\'ve seen it in the men and women of \\r\\n\\t\\tour military. In America, you always keep going. We\\'re Americans. We\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tnot big on quitting. And remember, before we can \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep going, we\\'ve got to get going by electing Barack Obama the next \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident of the United States. We don\\'t have a moment to lose or a vote \\r\\n\\t\\tto spare. Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren hangs in the balance. I want you to think about \\r\\n\\t\\tyour children and grandchildren come Election Day. Think about the \\r\\n\\t\\tchoices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on \\r\\n\\t\\tyour lives and on the life of our nation. We\\'ve got to ensure that the \\r\\n\\t\\tchoice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and \\r\\n\\t\\thope. That is our duty, to build \\r\\n\\t\\tthat bright future, to teach our children that, in America, there is no \\r\\n\\t\\tchasm too deep, no barrier too great, no ceiling too high for all who \\r\\n\\t\\twork hard, who keep going, have faith in God, in our country, and each \\r\\n\\t\\tother. That is our mission, \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrats. Let\\'s elect Barack Obama and Joe Biden for that future worthy \\r\\n\\t\\tof our great country. Thank you. God bless you, \\r\\n\\t\\tand Godspeed.',\n",
       " \"Thank you. Thank you very \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch. Thank you. Ya'll sit down. We've gotta get on with the show, here! \\r\\n\\t\\tC'mon. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be here tonight. \\r\\n\\t\\tSit down. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you....I am honored to be \\r\\n\\t\\tthere tonight -- Please, stop. Thank you. Please, stop. Sit down.... You know, I -- I love \\r\\n\\t\\tthis. And I thank you. But we have important work to do tonight. I am \\r\\n\\t\\there -- first -- to support Barack Obama. And second -- And second, I'm \\r\\n\\t\\there to warm up the crowd for Joe Biden, \\r\\n\\t\\tthough as you will soon see, he doesn\\x92t need any help from me.\\xa0I love Joe \\r\\n\\t\\tBiden, and America will too. What a year we Democrats \\r\\n\\t\\thave had. The primary began with an all-star line up and it came down to \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo remarkable Americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very \\r\\n\\t\\tend.\\xa0That campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming. Now, in the end, my \\r\\n\\t\\tcandidate didn't win. But I'm really proud of the campaign she ran. I am \\r\\n\\t\\tproud that she never quit on the people she stood up for, on the changes \\r\\n\\t\\tshe pushed for, on the future she wanted for all our children. And I'm \\r\\n\\t\\tgrateful for the chance Chelsea and I had to go all over America to tell \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople about the person we know and love. Now, I am not so grateful for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe chance to speak in the wake ofHillary's magnificent speechlast \\r\\n\\t\\tnight. But I'll do the best I can. Last night, Hillary told us \\r\\n\\t\\tin no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to \\r\\n\\t\\telect Barack Obama. That makes two of us. Actually, that makes 18 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion of us -- because, like Hillary, I want all of you who supported \\r\\n\\t\\ther to vote for Barack Obama in November. And here's why. And I have the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivilege of speaking here, thanks to you, from a perspective that no \\r\\n\\t\\tother American Democrat, except President Carter, can offer. Our -- Our nation is in \\r\\n\\t\\ttrouble on two fronts. The American dream is under siege at home, and \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica's leadership in the world has been weakened. Middle-class and \\r\\n\\t\\tlow-income Americans are hurting, with incomes declining, job losses, \\r\\n\\t\\tpoverty, and inequality rising, mortgage foreclosures and credit card \\r\\n\\t\\tdebt increasing, health care coverage disappearing, and a very big spike \\r\\n\\t\\tin the cost of food, utilities, and gasoline. And our position in the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little \\r\\n\\t\\tcooperation by a -- by a perilous dependence \\r\\n\\t\\ton imported oil, by a refusal to lead on global warming, by a growing \\r\\n\\t\\tindebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders, by a severely burdened \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary, by a backsliding on global nonproliferation and arms control \\r\\n\\t\\tagreements, and by a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy, \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the Middle East to Africa to Latin America to Central and Eastern \\r\\n\\t\\tEurope. Clearly, the job of the next \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident is to rebuild the American dream and to restore American \\r\\n\\t\\tleadership in the world. And here's what I have to say about that: Everything I learned in my eight years as \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident, and \\r\\n\\t\\tin the work I have done since in America and across the globe, has \\r\\n\\t\\tconvinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job. Now, he has a remarkable \\r\\n\\t\\tability to inspire people, to raise our hopes and rally us to high \\r\\n\\t\\tpurpose. He has the intelligence and curiosity every successful \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident needs. His policies on the economy, on taxes, on health care, \\r\\n\\t\\ton energy are far superior to the Republican alternatives. He has shown -- \\r\\n\\t\\tHe has shown \\r\\n\\t\\ta clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a \\r\\n\\t\\tfirm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military. His family heritage and his \\r\\n\\t\\tlife experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our \\r\\n\\t\\tincreasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world. The long, hard primary \\r\\n\\t\\ttested and strengthened him. And in his first presidential decision, the \\r\\n\\t\\tselection of a running mate, he hit it out of the park. With Joe Biden's experience \\r\\n\\t\\tand wisdom, supporting Barack Obama's proven understanding, instincts, \\r\\n\\t\\tand insight, America will have the national security leadership we need. And so, my fellow Democrats, \\r\\n\\t\\tI say to you: Barack Obama is ready to lead America and to restore \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican leadership in the world. Barack Obama is ready to \\r\\n\\t\\thonor the oath, to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States. Barack Obama is ready to be \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident of the United States. As President, he will work \\r\\n\\t\\tfor an America with more partners and fewer adversaries. He will rebuild \\r\\n\\t\\tour frayed alliances and revitalize the international institutions which \\r\\n\\t\\thelped to share the cost of the world's problems and to leverage the \\r\\n\\t\\tpower of our influence. He will put us back in the \\r\\n\\t\\tforefront of the world's fight against global warming and the fight to \\r\\n\\t\\treduce nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He will continue and enhance \\r\\n\\t\\tour nation's commendable global leadership in an area in which I am \\r\\n\\t\\tdeeply involved: the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding -- including -- and this is very important -- a renewal of the \\r\\n\\t\\tbattle against HIV and AIDS here at home. A President Obama will \\r\\n\\t\\tchoose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort. But, in a world troubled by \\r\\n\\t\\tterror, by trafficking in weapons, drugs and people, by human rights \\r\\n\\t\\tabuses of the most awful kind, by other threats to our security, our \\r\\n\\t\\tinterests, and our values, when he cannot convert adversaries into \\r\\n\\t\\tpartners, he will stand up to them. Barack Obama also will not \\r\\n\\t\\tallow the world's problems to obscure its opportunities. Everywhere, in rich and poor \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries alike, hard-working people need good jobs, secure, affordable \\r\\n\\t\\thealth care, food and energy, quality education for their children and \\r\\n\\t\\teconomically beneficial ways to fight global warming. These challenges cry out for \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican ideas and American innovation. When Barack Obama unleashes \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, America will save lives, win new allies, open new markets, and \\r\\n\\t\\tcreate wonderful new jobs for our own people. Most important of all, \\r\\n\\t\\tBarack Obama knows that America cannot be strong abroad unless we are \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst strong at home. People the world over have \\r\\n\\t\\talways been more impressed by the power of our example than by the \\r\\n\\t\\texample of our power. Look -- Look at the example the \\r\\n\\t\\tRepublicans have set. In this decade, American \\r\\n\\t\\tworkers have consistently given us rising productivity. That means, year \\r\\n\\t\\tafter year, they work harder and produce more. Now, what did they get in \\r\\n\\t\\treturn? Declining wages, less than one-fourth as many new jobs as in the \\r\\n\\t\\tprevious eight years, smaller health care and pension benefits, rising \\r\\n\\t\\tpoverty, and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s. American families by the \\r\\n\\t\\tmillions are struggling with soaring health care costs and declining \\r\\n\\t\\tcoverage. I will never forget the \\r\\n\\t\\tparents of children with autism and other serious conditions who told me \\r\\n\\t\\ton the campaign trail that they couldn't afford health care and couldn't \\r\\n\\t\\tqualify their children for Medicaid unless they quit work and starved or \\r\\n\\t\\tgot a divorce. Are these the family values \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Republicans are so proud of? What about the military \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies pushed to the breaking point by multiple, multiple deployments? \\r\\n\\t\\tWhat about the assault on science and the defense of torture? What about \\r\\n\\t\\tthe war on unions and the unlimited favors for the well-connected? And what about Katrina and \\r\\n\\t\\tcronyism? My fellow Democrats, America \\r\\n\\t\\tcan do better than that. And Barack Obama will do \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter than that. Wait a minute. But first -- Yes, he can -- but, first, we \\r\\n\\t\\thave to elect him. The choice is clear. The \\r\\n\\t\\tRepublicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry heroically and who suffered terribly in a Vietnamese prison \\r\\n\\t\\tcamp. He loves his country every bit as much as we do. As a senator, he \\r\\n\\t\\thas shown his independence of right-wing orthodoxy on some very \\r\\n\\t\\timportant issues. But on the two great \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions of this election -- how to rebuild the American dream and how \\r\\n\\t\\tto restore America's leadership in the world -- he still embraces the \\r\\n\\t\\textreme philosophy that has defined his Party for more than 25 years. And it is, to be fair to all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Americans who aren't as hard-core Democrats as we, it's a \\r\\n\\t\\tphilosophy the American people never actually had a chance to see in \\r\\n\\t\\taction fully until 2001, when the Republicans finally gained control of \\r\\n\\t\\tboth the White House and the Congress. Then we saw what would \\r\\n\\t\\thappen to America if the policies they had talked about for decades \\r\\n\\t\\tactually were implemented. And look what happened. They took us from \\r\\n\\t\\trecord surpluses to an exploding debt; from over 22 million new jobs to \\r\\n\\t\\tjust 5 million; from increasing working families' incomes to nearly 7500 \\r\\n\\t\\tdollars a \\r\\n\\t\\tyear to a decline of more than 2,000 dollars a year; from almost 8 million \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans lifted out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million driven into \\r\\n\\t\\tpoverty; and millions more losing their health insurance. Now, in spite of all this \\r\\n\\t\\tevidence, their candidate is actually promising more of the same. Think about it: more tax \\r\\n\\t\\tcuts for the wealthiest Americans that will swell the deficit, increase \\r\\n\\t\\tinequality, and weaken the economy; more Band-Aids for health care that \\r\\n\\t\\twill enrich insurance companies, impoverish families, and increase the \\r\\n\\t\\tnumber of uninsured; more going it alone in the world, instead of \\r\\n\\t\\tbuilding the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary \\r\\n\\t\\tto advance our security and restore our influence. They actually want us to \\r\\n\\t\\treward them for the last eight years by giving them four more. Now, let's send them a \\r\\n\\t\\tmessage that will echo from the Rockies all across America, a simple \\r\\n\\t\\tmessage: Thanks, but no thanks. In this case -- In this case, the third time \\r\\n\\t\\tis not the charm. My -- My fellow Democrats, 16 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago, you gave me the profound honor to lead our Party to victory \\r\\n\\t\\tand to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared \\r\\n\\t\\tprosperity. Together, we prevailed in a \\r\\n\\t\\thard campaign in which the Republicans said I was too young and too \\r\\n\\t\\tinexperienced to be Commander-in-Chief. Sound familiar? It didn't work in 1992, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we were on the right side of history. And it will not work in \\r\\n\\t\\t2008, because Barack Obama is on the right side of history. Now, Senator Obama's life is \\r\\n\\t\\ta 21st-century incarnation of the old-fashioned American Dream. His \\r\\n\\t\\tachievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more \\r\\n\\t\\tperfect union of our founders' dreams. The values of freedom and equal \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity, which have given him his historic chance, will drive him as \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident to give all Americans -- regardless of race, religion, gender, \\r\\n\\t\\tsexual orientation, or disability -- their chance to build a decent life \\r\\n\\t\\tand to show our humanity, as well as our strengths, to the world. We see that humanity, that \\r\\n\\t\\tstrength, and our nation's future in Barack and Michelle Obama and their \\r\\n\\t\\tbeautiful children. We see them reinforced by \\r\\n\\t\\tthe partnership with Joe Biden, his fabulous wife, Jill, a wonderful \\r\\n\\t\\tteacher, and their family. Barack Obama will lead us \\r\\n\\t\\taway from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity \\r\\n\\t\\tand hope. So if, like me, you believe \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica must always be a place called Hope, then join Hillary and \\r\\n\\t\\tChelsea and me in making Barack Obama the next President of the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates. Thank you, and God bless \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. Thank you.\",\n",
       " 'Good evening, and let me express my deep honor and pleasure at being here. I want to thank Director General Tokayev and Ms. Wyden along with other ministers, ambassadors, excellencies, and UN partners. This weekend, we will celebrate Human Rights Day, the anniversary of one of the great accomplishments of the last century. Beginning in 1947, delegates from six continents devoted themselves to drafting a declaration that would enshrine the fundamental rights and freedoms of people everywhere. In the aftermath of World War II, many nations pressed for a statement of this kind to help ensure that we would prevent future atrocities and protect the inherent humanity and dignity of all people. And so the delegates went to work. They discussed, they wrote, they revisited, revised, rewrote, for thousands of hours. And they incorporated suggestions and revisions from governments, organizations, and individuals around the world. At three o\\'clock in the morning on December 10th, 1948, after nearly two years of drafting and one last long night of debate, the president of the UN General Assembly called for a vote on the final text. Forty-eight nations voted in favor; eight abstained; none dissented. And the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. It proclaims a simple, powerful idea: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. And with the declaration, it was made clear that rights are not conferred by government; they are the birthright of all people. It does not matter what country we live in, who our leaders are, or even who we are. Because we are human, we therefore have rights. And because we have rights, governments are bound to protect them. In the 63 years since the declaration was adopted, many nations have made great progress in making human rights a human reality. Step by step, barriers that once prevented people from enjoying the full measure of liberty, the full experience of dignity, and the full benefits of humanity have fallen away. In many places, racist laws have been repealed, legal and social practices that relegated women to second-class status have been abolished, the ability of religious minorities to practice their faith freely has been secured. In most cases, this progress was not easily won. People fought and organized and campaigned in public squares and private spaces to change not only laws, but hearts and minds. And thanks to that work of generations, for millions of individuals whose lives were once narrowed by injustice, they are now able to live more freely and to participate more fully in the political, economic, and social lives of their communities. Now, there is still, as you all know, much more to be done to secure that commitment, that reality, and progress for all people. Today, I want to talk about the work we have left to do to protect one group of people whose human rights are still denied in too many parts of the world today. In many ways, they are an invisible minority. They are arrested, beaten, terrorized, even executed. Many are treated with contempt and violence by their fellow citizens while authorities empowered to protect them look the other way or, too often, even join in the abuse. They are denied opportunities to work and learn, driven from their homes and countries, and forced to suppress or deny who they are to protect themselves from harm. I am talking about gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, human beings born free and given bestowed equality and dignity, who have a right to claim that, which is now one of the remaining human rights challenges of our time. I speak about this subject knowing that my own country\\'s record on human rights for gay people is far from perfect. Until 2003, it was still a crime in parts of our country. Many LGBT Americans have endured violence and harassment in their own lives, and for some, including many young people, bullying and exclusion are daily experiences. So we, like all nations, have more work to do to protect human rights at home. Now, raising this issue, I know, is sensitive for many people and that the obstacles standing in the way of protecting the human rights of LGBT people rest on deeply held personal, political, cultural, and religious beliefs. So I come here before you with respect, understanding, and humility. Even though progress on this front is not easy, we cannot delay acting. So in that spirit, I want to talk about the difficult and important issues we must address together to reach a global consensus that recognizes the human rights of LGBT citizens everywhere. The first issue goes to the heart of the matter. Some have suggested that gay rights and human rights are separate and distinct; but, in fact, they are one and the same. Now, of course, 60 years ago, the governments that drafted and passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were not thinking about how it applied to the LGBT community. They also weren\\x92t thinking about how it applied to indigenous people or children or people with disabilities or other marginalized groups. Yet in the past 60 years, we have come to recognize that members of these groups are entitled to the full measure of dignity and rights, because, like all people, they share a common humanity. This recognition did not occur all at once. It evolved over time. And as it did, we understood that we were honoring rights that people always had, rather than creating new or special rights for them. Like being a woman, like being a racial, religious, tribal, or ethnic minority, being LGBT does not make you less human. And that is why gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights. It is violation of human rights when people are beaten or killed because of their sexual orientation, or because they do not conform to cultural norms about how men and women should look or behave. It is a violation of human rights when governments declare it illegal to be gay, or allow those who harm gay people to go unpunished. It is a violation of human rights when lesbian or transgendered women are subjected to so-called corrective rape, or forcibly subjected to hormone treatments, or when people are murdered after public calls for violence toward gays, or when they are forced to flee their nations and seek asylum in other lands to save their lives. And it is a violation of human rights when life-saving care is withheld from people because they are gay, or equal access to justice is denied to people because they are gay, or public spaces are out of bounds to people because they are gay. No matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we are, we are all equally entitled to our human rights and dignity. The second issue is a question of whether homosexuality arises from a particular part of the world. Some seem to believe it is a Western phenomenon, and therefore people outside the West have grounds to reject it. Well, in reality, gay people are born into and belong to every society in the world. They are all ages, all races, all faiths; they are doctors and teachers, farmers and bankers, soldiers and athletes; and whether we know it, or whether we acknowledge it, they are our family, our friends, and our neighbors. Being gay is not a Western invention; it is a human reality. And protecting the human rights of all people, gay or straight, is not something that only Western governments do. South Africa\\x92s constitution, written in the aftermath of Apartheid, protects the equality of all citizens, including gay people. In Colombia and Argentina, the rights of gays are also legally protected. In Nepal, the supreme court has ruled that equal rights apply to LGBT citizens. The Government of Mongolia has committed to pursue new legislation that will tackle anti-gay discrimination. Now, some worry that protecting the human rights of the LGBT community is a luxury that only wealthy nations can afford. But in fact, in all countries, there are costs to not protecting these rights, in both gay and straight lives lost to disease and violence, and the silencing of voices and views that would strengthen communities, in ideas never pursued by entrepreneurs who happen to be gay. Costs are incurred whenever any group is treated as lesser or the other, whether they are women, racial, or religious minorities, or the LGBT. Former President Mogae of Botswana pointed out recently that for as long as LGBT people are kept in the shadows, there cannot be an effective public health program to tackle HIV and AIDS. Well, that holds true for other challenges as well. The third, and perhaps most challenging, issue arises when people cite religious or cultural values as a reason to violate or not to protect the human rights of LGBT citizens. This is not unlike the justification offered for violent practices towards women like honor killings, widow burning, or female genital mutilation. Some people still defend those practices as part of a cultural tradition. But violence toward women isn\\'t cultural; it\\'s criminal. Likewise with slavery, what was once justified as sanctioned by God is now properly reviled as an unconscionable violation of human rights. In each of these cases, we came to learn that no practice or tradition trumps the human rights that belong to all of us. And this holds true for inflicting violence on LGBT people, criminalizing their status or behavior, expelling them from their families and communities, or tacitly or explicitly accepting their killing. Of course, it bears noting that rarely are cultural and religious traditions and teachings actually in conflict with the protection of human rights. Indeed, our religion and our culture are sources of compassion and inspiration toward our fellow human beings. It was not only those who\\x92ve justified slavery who leaned on religion, it was also those who sought to abolish it. And let us keep in mind that our commitments to protect the freedom of religion and to defend the dignity of LGBT people emanate from a common source. For many of us, religious belief and practice is a vital source of meaning and identity, and fundamental to who we are as people. And likewise, for most of us, the bonds of love and family that we forge are also vital sources of meaning and identity. And caring for others is an expression of what it means to be fully human. It is because the human experience is universal that human rights are universal and cut across all religions and cultures. The fourth issue is what history teaches us about how we make progress towards rights for all. Progress starts with honest discussion. Now, there are some who say and believe that all gay people are pedophiles, that homosexuality is a disease that can be caught or cured, or that gays recruit others to become gay. Well, these notions are simply not true. They are also unlikely to disappear if those who promote or accept them are dismissed out of hand rather than invited to share their fears and concerns. No one has ever abandoned a belief because he was forced to do so. Universal human rights include freedom of expression and freedom of belief, even if our words or beliefs denigrate the humanity of others. Yet, while we are each free to believe whatever we choose, we cannot do whatever we choose, not in a world where we protect the human rights of all. Reaching understanding of these issues takes more than speech. It does take a conversation. In fact, it takes a constellation of conversations in places big and small. And it takes a willingness to see stark differences in belief as a reason to begin the conversation, not to avoid it. But progress comes from changes in laws. In many places, including my own country, legal protections have preceded, not followed, broader recognition of rights. Laws have a teaching effect. Laws that discriminate validate other kinds of discrimination. Laws that require equal protections reinforce the moral imperative of equality. And practically speaking, it is often the case that laws must change before fears about change dissipate. Many in my country thought that President Truman was making a grave error when he ordered the racial desegregation of our military. They argued that it would undermine unit cohesion. And it wasn\\'t until he went ahead and did it that we saw how it strengthened our social fabric in ways even the supporters of the policy could not foresee. Likewise, some worried in my country that the repeal of \\x93Don\\'t Ask, Don\\x92t Tell\\x94 would have a negative effect on our armed forces. Now, the Marine Corps Commandant, who was one of the strongest voices against the repeal, says that his concerns were unfounded and that the Marines have embraced the change. Finally, progress comes from being willing to walk a mile in someone else\\'s shoes. We need to ask ourselves, \"How would it feel if it were a crime to love the person I love? How would it feel to be discriminated against for something about myself that I cannot change?\" This challenge applies to all of us as we reflect upon deeply held beliefs, as we work to embrace tolerance and respect for the dignity of all persons, and as we engage humbly with those with whom we disagree in the hope of creating greater understanding. A fifth and final question is how we do our part to bring the world to embrace human rights for all people including LGBT people. Yes, LGBT people must help lead this effort, as so many of you are. Their knowledge and experiences are invaluable and their courage inspirational. We know the names of brave LGBT activists who have literally given their lives for this cause, and there are many more whose names we will never know. But often those who are denied rights are least empowered to bring about the changes they seek. Acting alone, minorities can never achieve the majorities necessary for political change. So when any part of humanity is sidelined, the rest of us cannot sit on the sidelines. Every time a barrier to progress has fallen, it has taken a cooperative effort from those on both sides of the barrier. In the fight for women\\x92s rights, the support of men remains crucial. The fight for racial equality has relied on contributions from people of all races. Combating Islamaphobia or anti-Semitism is a task for people of all faiths. And the same is true with this struggle for equality. Conversely, when we see denials and abuses of human rights and fail to act, that sends the message to those deniers and abusers that they won\\x92t suffer any consequences for their actions, and so they carry on. But when we do act, we send a powerful moral message. Right here in Geneva, the international community acted this year to strengthen a global consensus around the human rights of LGBT people. At the Human Rights Council in March, 85 countries from all regions supported a statement calling for an end to criminalization and violence against people because of their sexual orientation and gender identity. At the following session of the Council in June, South Africa took the lead on a resolution about violence against LGBT people. The delegation from South Africa spoke eloquently about their own experience and struggle for human equality and its indivisibility. When the measure passed, it became the first-ever UN resolution recognizing the human rights of gay people worldwide. In the Organization of American States this year, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights created a unit on the rights of LGBT people, a step toward what we hope will be the creation of a special rapporteur. Now, we must go further and work here and in every region of the world to galvanize more support for the human rights of the LGBT community. To the leaders of those countries where people are jailed, beaten, or executed for being gay, I ask you to consider this: Leadership, by definition, means being out in front of your people when it is called for. It means standing up for the dignity of all your citizens and persuading your people to do the same. It also means ensuring that all citizens are treated as equals under your laws, because let me be clear \\x96 I am not saying that gay people can\\x92t or don\\x92t commit crimes. They can and they do, just like straight people. And when they do, they should be held accountable, but it should never be a crime to be gay. And to people of all nations, I say supporting human rights is your responsibility too. The lives of gay people are shaped not only by laws, but by the treatment they receive every day from their families, from their neighbors. Eleanor Roosevelt, who did so much to advance human rights worldwide, said that these rights begin in the small places close to home \\x96 the streets where people live, the schools they attend, the factories, farms, and offices where they work. These places are your domain. The actions you take, the ideals that you advocate, can determine whether human rights flourish where you are. And finally, to LGBT men and women worldwide, let me say this: Wherever you live and whatever the circumstances of your life, whether you are connected to a network of support or feel isolated and vulnerable, please know that you are not alone. People around the globe are working hard to support you and to bring an end to the injustices and dangers you face. That is certainly true for my country. And you have an ally in the United States of America and you have millions of friends among the American people. The Obama Administration defends the human rights of LGBT people as part of our comprehensive human rights policy and as a priority of our foreign policy. In our embassies, our diplomats are raising concerns about specific cases and laws, and working with a range of partners to strengthen human rights protections for all. In Washington, we have created a task force at the State Department to support and coordinate this work. And in the coming months, we will provide every embassy with a toolkit to help improve their efforts. And we have created a program that offers emergency support to defenders of human rights for LGBT people. This morning, back in Washington, President Obama put into place the first U.S. Government strategy dedicated to combating human rights abuses against LGBT persons abroad. Building on efforts already underway at the State Department and across the government, the President has directed all U.S. Government agencies engaged overseas to combat the criminalization of LGBT status and conduct, to enhance efforts to protect vulnerable LGBT refugees and asylum seekers, to ensure that our foreign assistance promotes the protection of LGBT rights, to enlist international organizations in the fight against discrimination, and to respond swiftly to abuses against LGBT persons. I am also pleased to announce that we are launching a new Global Equality Fund that will support the work of civil society organizations working on these issues around the world. This fund will help them record facts so they can target their advocacy, learn how to use the law as a tool, manage their budgets, train their staffs, and forge partnerships with women\\x92s organizations and other human rights groups. We have committed more than $3 million to start this fund, and we have hope that others will join us in supporting it. The women and men who advocate for human rights for the LGBT community in hostile places, some of whom are here today with us, are brave and dedicated, and deserve all the help we can give them. We know the road ahead will not be easy. A great deal of work lies before us. But many of us have seen firsthand how quickly change can come. In our lifetimes, attitudes toward gay people in many places have been transformed. Many people, including myself, have experienced a deepening of our own convictions on this topic over the years, as we have devoted more thought to it, engaged in dialogues and debates, and established personal and professional relationships with people who are gay. This evolution is evident in many places. To highlight one example, the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality in India two years ago, writing, and I quote, \\x93If there is one tenet that can be said to be an underlying theme of the Indian constitution, it is inclusiveness.\\x94 There is little doubt in my mind that support for LGBT human rights will continue to climb. Because for many young people, this is simple: All people deserve to be treated with dignity and have their human rights respected, no matter who they are or whom they love. There is a phrase that people in the United States invoke when urging others to support human rights: \\x93Be on the right side of history.\\x94 The story of the United States is the story of a nation that has repeatedly grappled with intolerance and inequality. We fought a brutal civil war over slavery. People from coast to coast joined in campaigns to recognize the rights of women, indigenous peoples, racial minorities, children, people with disabilities, immigrants, workers, and on and on. And the march toward equality and justice has continued. Those who advocate for expanding the circle of human rights were and are on the right side of history, and history honors them. Those who tried to constrict human rights were wrong, and history reflects that as well. I know that the thoughts I\\x92ve shared today involve questions on which opinions are still evolving. As it has happened so many times before, opinion will converge once again with the truth, the immutable truth, that all persons are created free and equal in dignity and rights. We are called once more to make real the words of the Universal Declaration. Let us answer that call. Let us be on the right side of history, for our people, our nations, and future generations, whose lives will be shaped by the work we do today. I come before you with great hope and confidence that no matter how long the road ahead, we will travel it successfully together. Thank you very much. Book/CDs by Michael E.

       " 'Good morning, church. Let us first give honor to God, though whom all blessings flow. I have a couple things that I need to share with you; and Pastor Campbell talked about how this came about. This was a conversation on Friday -- Friday evening. Lisa and I were still away and we returned to Philadelphia late yesterday evening. I first want to start with a passage, and then I have some thoughts that I\\'d like to share. 1st Corinthians 15-56: My brothers and sisters in Christ, I\\'ve tried to live by those words in the course of my work in service to the city of Philadelphia, serving the Lord in each and every day, saying a prayer for all of us, first in the morning, last thing at night. This, of course, is great, great church, theMount Carmel Baptist Church, with a great, great leader, the Reverend Doctor Albert F. Campbell, Senior. Please recognize him. And he -- as he has done with me, let me also recognize our Great Mom, Mom Campbell. To the deacons and deaconesses and the board of trustees, all of the members, and the groups and organizations, and -- I saw as they were passing -- many of the members of the choir. Many of you will recall that the choir took off, 20-some odd years ago -- as soon as I got off the choir, they started singing a whole lot better. But I do thank them, and many of them acknowledged our connection. I come today with a number of thoughts. And Pastor\\'s correct -- we had some general conversation. He does not know exactly what I\\'m going to say and that\\'s a testament to our relationship. It\\'s a relationship that goes back a good long way. And some of -- of you I\\'ve, of course, known for a long time and some may be newer, so let me just share a little bit. The first time I came to Mount Carmel Baptist church was on May 12th, 1985. I was working on a political campaign. And many of us, of course, rememberthe events of that day and the next day. Philadelphia\\'s not been the same since. That was the first time I came to this church, the first time I heard Reverend Campbell preach. A year later in 1986 I joined this church. I\\'ve been a member of this church for 25 years. I\\'m 54 years old. And no, you don\\'t see my all the time, and no I\\'m not here all the time, but let me assure you that I\\'m around. I\\'ve been in this church on some pretty important occasions for me and my family. Twenty-five years ago, I became a member. Five years later I walked down this aisle in July of 1991 with Lisa Johnson. And we were married here 20 years ago in Mount Carmel Baptist church. People talk about sustainability, well that\\'s sustainability \\'cause anybody can put up with me for 20 years -- deserves something. Please recognize my wife, Lisa. Four years later -- 16 years ago -- our daughter was christened here. You\\'ve seen her on a couple of occasions. Five years ago, in the summer of 2006, Reverend and Mom Campbell stood with me on the porch on Parkside Avenue where I announced that I was running for mayor, when no one thought that we had not one chance --\\xa0 anywhere. (I\\'m in church.) And about three and a half years ago, Reverend Campbell was on the stage at the Academy of Music participating in the inaugural celebration on January 7th, 2008. And we pray together. Many of you may not know that Reverend Campbell, Reverend Alan [ph], Reverend Good [ph] have prayer with me on a regular basis, \\'cause in this job you need some prayer. So we have a history and we have a relationship. And what I also know is that Reverend Campbell doesn\\'t have each and everybody -- every Tom, Dick, and Harry -- up in this pulpit. And so I recognize that this is a very special granting. And I also told him on Friday I understand that I\\'m not the preacher of the hour. And this is the first Sunday of August, and communion Sunday. So I\\'m going to be brief. Now, I must say first two things. One, some of you may know that 30 Americans died overseas -- an elite unit of our military. And whether you agree with our foreign policy or not, I would certainly ask that you would pray for the men and women who risk their lives each and every day to make sure that we can enjoy the freedoms as Americans that some of us seem to take for granted.\\xa0They\\'re serving their country. Other people make the decision about what they do and where they go, but they\\'re doing their job. And unfortunately, one of those 30 is a son of a Philadelphia police officer. So I would ask that you would keep all of them, and especially that Philadelphia family that\\'s been affected, in your hearts. Now, I\\'m going to say something things this morning that I know from time to time many of you think, but may not say. There will not be \"PC\". But I\\'ve told Reverend Campbell that I recognize that I am in church and I am in his pulpit, so I will certainly be respectful. On the other hand, there are some words that we know that are also found in the Bible -- and I may use a few of those. Pastor mentioned that we\\'ve had some incidents in Philadelphia, the most recent of which wasFriday before last, 20, 30 kids running aroundCenter Cityand it\\'s happened in other parts of Philadelphia as well -- a 16, a 17, a 19-year-old, and, yes, an 11-year-old. And while I may have been out of my office, I was not out of communication. And I sent a message topolice commissioner Ramsey, the first thing that morning as soon as I heard that report -- read that report -- that we have to do something. And we put our team together that day to start working on some things. And so I want to share my thoughts. The first is this nonsense must stop. It must stop. If you want to act like a butthead, your butthead is going to get locked up. And if you want to act like an idiot, move. Move out of this city. We don\\'t want you here anymore. And first I want to apologize. I want to apologize to all the good, hardworking, caring people here in this city, and especially our good, young people here in Philadelphia. But I have to tell you this morning that I am forced by the stupid, ignorant, dumb actions of a few -- and we will announce tomorrowactions that we will takethat unfortunately will affect many here in our city. Parents: Get your act together. Get it together. Get it together right now. You need to get home to your kids before we have to. Parents who neglect their children, who don\\'t know where they are, don\\'t know what they\\'re doing, don\\'t know who they\\'re hanging out with -- you\\'re going to find yourselves spending some quality time with your kids in jail -- together. Together. Now this stupid behavior requires a strong response. But I can assure you that we are not going to just be responding. We\\'re going to be much more proactive in our activities, and we\\'re going to try our best to anticipate some of these senseless teenage insane acts that we have been seeing over the past few months. Parents -- mothers and fathers -- now I happen to know that raising children is kinda tough. I\\'ve got two kids, one of whom is a teenager right now. If you need help, we have help for you: Department of Human Services, community behavioral health will help, and many other social service agencies. Do not be afraid. Do not be ashamed to reach out and ask for help, counseling, guidance, or support. But you need to get the help now before it\\'s too late for the help to help you. Get some help. And fathers, fathers, fathers have a particularly important role to play; not more important than mothers but just as important. You know, you\\'re not a father just because you have a kid or two or three. That doesn\\'t make you a father. A father is a person who\\'s around to participate in a child\\'s life. He\\'s a teacher. Helps to guide and shape and mold that young person, someone for that young person to talk to, to share with -- their ups and their downs, their fears, and their concerns. A father has to provide instruction to a young boy on how to become a good man, agoodman. A father also has to be a good role model -- help a young girl be a strong woman. Now let me just say this: If you\\'re not doing those things, if you\\'re just hanging out out there -- maybe you\\'re sending a check or bringing some cash by -- that\\'s not being a father. You\\'re just a humanATM. You\\'re just an ATM. And if you\\'re not providing the guidance and you\\'re not sending any money, you\\'re just a sperm donor. You\\'re just a sperm donor. You\\'re what the girls call out in the street, \"That\\'s my baby\\' daddy.\" \"That\\'s my baby\\' daddy.\" That\\'s not good enough. Don\\'t be that. Don\\'t be that. You can do better than that. And you know something? That\\'s part of the problem in our community. Let me speak plain: That\\'s part of the problem in the black community -- and many other communities, but a particular problem in the black communities. We have too many men making too many babies that they don\\'t want to take care of, and then we end up dealing with your children. We\\'re not running a big baby-sitting service. We\\'re running a big government and a great city. Take care of your children -- all of \\'em. All of \\'em. You know, you\\'re sitting around with your jaws tight, \"Oh, she got two or three other guys around.\" Well if you were doing what you\\'re supposed to be doing, she wouldn\\'t be with the other two or three guys in the first place \\'cause you would be there taking care of all your children! Now, you were around for the sex -- now be around for the parenting. Be around for the parenting \\'cause let me tell you something: The Immaculate Conception of our Lord Jesus Christ took place a long time ago, and it didn\\'t happen here in Philadelphia. So every one of these kids has two parents who were around and participating at the time. They need to be around now. Ain\\'t no Immaculate Conception happening up in here. Parents, you need to step up [be]fore we have to step to you. Now tomorrow, at 12 noon on Dilworth Plaza we\\'re makinga series of announcements-- get a ton of folks involved in this effort. It\\'s not a one-time thing. It\\'s not a summertime thing. Young Audience Member:Amen Mayor Nutter:I heard a child say \"amen.\" Some of them smarter than some of these adults running around here. Tomorrow, we\\'re going to announce a series of steps and actions that will be taken. Some will be positive and some you won\\'t like. Unfortunately, that\\'s the way it goes. Now some of the more positive things we\\'re looking is programs or services and activities at our rec[reation] centers. Other supports we may be able to provide, we\\'re going to get our social service agencies involved but also theD.A.will be more involved and the courts will be more involved. We took a whole lot of stuff couple of years back. And by the way, every one of those libraries is open. Tell your children: Get a book! Read a book! Learn something. School is open September 6th on Tuesday, day after Labor Day. Spend the next month reading. How about trying it out for a change? And whatever you do, just stay out of trouble. Think for yourself. Don\\'t do stupid stuff. Now, some of you know I grew up nine blocks from here -- 5519 Larchwood Avenue. I\\'m going to be \"West Philly\" no matter where I live, no matter what I do for the rest of my life. And before I ever heard of the \"Philadelphia Code\" or the \"Pennsylvania Code\" or any other code, I was very familiar with the Basil and Catalina Code. It was the code of my parents. Now, I have to tell you, when I heard this particular report -- and we\\'ve had other incidences -- but it is inconceivable to me -- inconceivable to me -- that in my teenage years that I would be out somewhere running along downtown at nine o\\'clock at night. Impossible for me to fathom. Because my mother said, \"Boy, I know you have a watch, but if the watch stops working, if you forget to wind it, if the battery breaks, there\\'s only one thing you need to do: Look up. When that light goes on, have your butt on the steps. I don\\'t care whether its Eastern Standard Time, Daylight Saving[s] Time, Pacific Time, Mid-Atlantic Time, North Pole Time. When that light goes on, have your butt on the steps. Don\\'t let me have to look for you.\" Now that\\'s what she said. It was real easy, real simple. And you know, I know a lot has happened in the 40 years since I was an early teen. I know that some things have changed. But now, there are a few things that don\\'t or shouldn\\'t change: Respect other people; keep your hands to yourself; don\\'t touch what doesn\\'t belong to you or what you didn\\'t earn; keep your butt in the house or on the steps until you\\'re told otherwise; and mind your manners. Now, my parents were would be very clear that these were there rules, and that as long as I lived in their house, that was it. See, because I didn\\'t own anything in that house. And I had a job. And I bought stuff with my own money. But when I cross that threshold, it was theirs. \"That room? We let \\tyou sleep in that room.\" \"This air \\tconditioning? We let you have some of that air conditioning.\" \"That heat that I \\tpay for? We let you have some of that heat.\" \"Those clothes on \\tyour body, I bought those clothes.\" \"I brought you in \\there, I\\'ll take you out of here.\" \"Now, let\\'s be very \\tclear about some rules. Now, when you get old enough and you \\tmove out, then you can do what you want to do. But as long as \\tyou live in this house, you do what I tell you to do.\" And that\\'s the way it was. Well that\\'s the way it needs to be. Now parents, please talk to your children. Talk to them today after service. Talk to them tonight. Talk to them tomorrow \\'cause things are going to change. This is some serious stuff. It\\'s not a joke. It\\'s not a game. And not funny. A curfew is going to be enforced. Other things are going to happen. And they need to understand that there are serious consequences to aggressive, violent, idiotic, stupid behavior -- not only for the teen but also for the parents or the guardians. Everybody\\'s going to be held accountable in this one. We\\'re taking these steps for the safety of all of our citizens and our teenagers -- and our teenagers. We want to make sure that they don\\'t either do something that\\'s going to get them in trouble, or be somewhere where they may get hurt. This is about all of us. It\\'s about everybody. And so, let me say again, the bottom line -- this nonsense must stop right now -- right now. And lastly to our teenagers: You know young people always talk about, \"Well, I\\'ve got to get respect.\" You get respect when you give respect. That\\'s how you get respect. And I believe in my heart and in my soul that 99% of young people here in the city of Philadelphia are good, and have good intentions in their heart. So, I don\\'t want anyone to think that we\\'ve got thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of untold numbers of bad young people running around -- \\'cause we don\\'t. We have some really great young people in this city. They go to school. They try to get good grades and try to graduate and go on with their lives. They participate in sports, art, music, poetry, cultural services. They\\'re out tutoring. Some of them have jobs and are working. Some are taking care of their siblings, parents, and even grandparents. Unfortunately, there\\'s a few -- could be a hundred, could be a couple of hundred, could be a thousand -- that\\'s still less than one percent, but there are some really bad ones. And unfortunately, they engage in violent behavior. They\\'re lawless. They act with ignorance. They don\\'t care about anybody else, and they\\'re behavior is outrageous. Well, we\\'re not going to tolerate that. We won\\'t tolerate it and we\\'re not going to excuse it because there is no excuse for it. Sense and nonsense cannot exist in the same place, in the same city, in the same world, and it\\'s not going to happen here in Philadelphia. We can\\'t have both at the same time. Can\\'t have both. And so, this behavior could have actually resulted in even more injuries, or worse. They could have killed somebody. Oh, then they\\x92d really be in a world of trouble. Then all the sudden, they\\x92d be crying: I want my mom. I need my dad. I need somebody. No, it\\x92s too late then. No, no, we\\x92re -- we\\'re past that. It\\x92s too late. It\\x92s too late. You\\x92ve damaged yourself, you\\x92ve damaged another person, you\\x92ve damaged your peers, and quite honestly you\\x92ve damaged your own race. You damaged your own race. So, to our young people: If you want black folks, if you want white folks, Latinos, Asians, or anybody else to respect you, and not be afraid when they see you walking down the street, then leave the innocent people who are walking down the street, minding their own damn business, leave them alone. Stop it. Cut it out. We\\x92ve had enough of this nonsense going on. We\\x92ve had enough. Some of them should be ashamed of their behavior. And some of them have made shame on our race. I\\x92m speaking plainly. I\\x92m telling you what\\x92s on my heart. It\\x92s a disgrace, what\\x92s going on. Not one of these victims, not one, did anything to any one of those young people. They weren\\x92t bothering them. They didn\\x92t say anything to them. They were minding their business. Some were out enjoying themselves. Some were just coming from work -- they didn\\x92t do one thing. And then all of the sudden, for the cowards that some of them are, in the crowd, thought they were anonymous, jumped up and started beating on people, assaulting them, in the streets of this city. Well you know, now, if that was one of their friends, if that was their brother, if that was their sister, their moms, their grandmoms, somebody, they\\x92d say, \\x93Oh, that ain\\x92t right, that\\x92s wrong.\\x94 Well, it\\x92s wrong when you do it too. It\\x92s wrong when you do it too. And so if you want to be aggressive, we\\x92re going to be aggressive. And let me just share this with you: We got the biggest, baddest gang in town -- a committed group of citizens and a committed government and we\\x92re working together and we\\x92re not going to have this nonsense anymore. And lastly let me say, some of those young folks are lucky. They\\x92re lucky that one of those citizens didn\\x92t jump up and start whipping their butt, which, clearly, they did not have enough of when they were young themselves. They\\x92re lucky they didn\\x92t get themselves beat up with this nonsense. So, let me close. We want a safe city. We will not tolerate ignorant, stupid, out-of-control behavior. It hurts our citizens, damages property, and besmirches our reputation as a great city. And so to all of our young people, but a particular message to our young African-American boys and girls, let me say this: If you want all of us -- black, white, or any other color -- if you want us to respect you, if you want us to look at you in a different way, if you want us not to be afraid to walk down the same side of the street with you, if you want folks not to jump out of the elevator when you get on, if you want folks to stop following you around in stores when you\\x92re out shopping, if you want somebody to offer you a job or an internship somewhere, if you don\\x92t want folks to be looking in or trying to go in a different direction when they see two or twenty of you coming down the street, then stop acting like idiots and fools, out in the streets of the city of Philadelphia. Just cut it out. And another thing. Take those doggone hoodies down, especially in the summer. Pull your pants up and buy a belt, because no one wants to see your underwear or the crack of your butt. Nobody. Buy a belt. Buy a belt. Nobody wants to see your underwear. Comb your hair -- and get some grooming skills. Comb your hair. Running round here with your hair all over the place. Learn some manners. Keep your butt in school. Graduate from high school. Go on to college so you can go and make something of yourself and be a good citizen here in this city. And why don\\x92t you work on extending your English vocabulary. Extend your English vocabulary beyond the few curse words that you know, some other grunts and grumbles and other things that none of us can understand what you\\x92re saying. And if you go to look for a job, don\\x92t go blame it on the white folks, or anybody else. If you walk in somebody\\x92s office with your hair uncombed and a pick in the back and your shoes untied and your pants half down, tattoos up and down your arm, on your face, on your neck, and you wonder why somebody won\\x92t hire you. They don\\x92t hire you because you look like you\\x92re crazy. That\\x92s why they\\x92re not hiring you. So, you do those things, and act like you got some sense, and you\\x92d be surprised what opportunities will open up to you. That\\x92s what was on my mind. That\\x92s all I\\x92ve got to say.',\n",
       " 'My name is Jimmy Carter, and \\r\\nI\\'m not running for President.But here\\'s what I will be doing: everything I can \\r\\nto put John Kerry in the White House with John Edwards right there beside him. 28 years ago I was \\r\\nrunning for President, and I said then, \"I want a government as good and as \\r\\nhonest and as decent and as competent and as compassionate as are the American \\r\\npeople.\" I say this again tonight, and that\\'s exactly what we will have next \\r\\nJanuary with John Kerry as President of the United States of America. As many of you may know, my first \\r\\nchosen career was in the United States Navy, where I served as a submarine \\r\\nofficer. At that time, my shipmates and I were ready for combat and prepared to \\r\\ngive our lives to defend our nation and its principles. At the same time, we always \\r\\nprayed that our readiness would preserve the peace. I served under two \\r\\nPresidents, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, men who represented different \\r\\npolitical parties -- both of whom had faced their active military responsibilities \\r\\nwith honor. They knew -- They knew the horrors of war, \\r\\nand later, as Commanders-in-Chief, they exercised restraint and judgment, and \\r\\nthey had \\r\\na clear sense of mission. We had a confidence -- We had a confidence that our leaders, \\r\\nboth military and \\r\\ncivilian, would not put our soldiers and sailors in harm\\'s way by initiating \\r\\n\"wars of choice\" unless America\\'s vital interests were endangered. We also were sure that these \\r\\nPresidents would not mislead us when issues involved our national \\r\\nsecurity. Today -- Today our Democratic party is led by another former naval officer \\r\\n-- one \\r\\nwho volunteered for military service. He showed up when assigned to duty, and he \\r\\nserved with honor and distinction. He also knows the horrors of \\r\\nwar and the responsibilities of leadership, and I am confident that next January \\r\\nhe would restore the judgment and maturity to our government that nowadays is sorely \\r\\nlacking. I am proud -- I am proud to call Lieutenant John Kerry my shipmate, and I\\'m \\r\\nready to follow him to victory in November. As you all know, our country \\r\\nfaces many challenges at home involving energy, taxation, the environment, \\r\\neducation, and health. To meet these challenges, we need new leaders in \\r\\nWashington whose policies are shaped by working American families instead of the \\r\\nsuper-rich and their armies of lobbyists in Washington. But the biggest reason to make John \\r\\nKerry President is even more important. It is to safeguard the security of our \\r\\nnation. Today, our dominant \\r\\ninternational challenge is to restore the greatness of America -- based on -- \\r\\nbased on telling \\r\\nthe truth, a commitment to peace, and respect for civil liberties at home and \\r\\nbasic human rights around the world. Truth is a foundation of our global \\r\\nleadership, but our credibility has been shattered and we are left increasingly \\r\\nisolated and vulnerable in a hostile world. Without truth, without trust, America \\r\\ncannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our democracy, the sacred \\r\\ncovenant between a President and the people. When that trust is violated, \\r\\nthe bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken. After 9/11, America \\r\\nstood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent \\r\\ncivilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding \\r\\naround the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as \\r\\nall this goodwill has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes \\r\\nand miscalculations. Unilateral acts -- Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States \\r\\nfrom the very nations we need to join us in combating terrorism. Let us not forget that the \\r\\nSoviets lost the Cold War because the American people combined the exercise of \\r\\npower with the adherence to basic principles, based on sustained bipartisan support. \\r\\nWe understood the positive link between the defense of our own freedom and the \\r\\npromotion of human rights. But recent policies have cost our nation its reputation \\r\\nas the world\\'s most admired champion of freedom and justice. What a difference \\r\\nthese few months of extremism have made. The United States has \\r\\nalienated its allies, dismayed its friends, and inadvertently gratified its \\r\\nenemies by proclaiming a confused and disturbing strategy of \"preemptive\" war. \\r\\nWith our allies disunited, the world resenting us, and the Middle East ablaze, \\r\\nwe need John Kerry to restore life to the global war against terrorism. In the meantime, the Middle \\r\\nEast peace process has come to a screeching halt for the first time since Israel \\r\\nbecame a nation. All former Presidents, Democratic and Republican, have \\r\\nattempted to secure a comprehensive peace for Israel with hope and justice for \\r\\nthe Palestinians. Theachievements of Camp Davida quarter century ago and the \\r\\nmore recent progress made by President Bill Clinton are now in peril. Instead, violence has gripped \\r\\nthe Holy Land, with the region increasingly swept by anti-American passions. \\r\\nThis must change. Elsewhere, North Korea\\'s nuclear menace \\r\\n-- a threat far more real and immediate \\r\\nthan any posed by Saddam Hussein -- has been allowed to advance unheeded, with \\r\\npotentially ominous consequences for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. \\r\\nThese are some of the prices our government has paid for this radical departure from  \\r\\nbasic American principles and values that are espoused by John Kerry. In repudiating extremism we \\r\\nneed to recommit ourselves to a few common-sense principles that should \\r\\ntranscend partisan differences. First, we cannot enhance our own security if we \\r\\nplace in jeopardy what is most precious to us, namely, the centrality of human \\r\\nrights in our daily lives and in global affairs. Second, we cannot maintain our \\r\\nhistoric self-confidence as a people if we generate public panic. Third, we \\r\\ncannot do our duty as citizens and patriots if we pursue an agenda that \\r\\npolarizes and divides our country. Next, we cannot be true to ourselves if we \\r\\nmistreat others. And finally, in the world at large we cannot lead if our \\r\\nleaders mislead. You can\\'t be a war President \\r\\none day and claim to be a peace President the next, depending on the latest \\r\\npolitical polls. When our national security requires military action, John Kerry \\r\\nhas already proven in Vietnam that he will not hesitate to act. And as a proven \\r\\ndefender of our national security, John Kerry will strengthen the global \\r\\nalliance against terrorism while avoiding unnecessary wars. Ultimately, the basic issue is \\r\\nwhether America will provide global leadership that springs from the unity and \\r\\nthe \\r\\nintegrity of the American people or whether extremist doctrines, the \\r\\nmanipulation of truth will define America\\'s role in the world. At stake is nothing less than \\r\\nour nation\\'s soul. In a few months, I will, God willing, enter my 81st year of \\r\\nmy life, and in many ways the last few months have been some of the most \\r\\ndisturbing of all. But I am not discouraged. I really am not. I do not despair for our country. I \\r\\nnever to. I \\r\\nbelieve tonight, as I always have, that the essential decency and compassion and \\r\\ncommon sense of the American people will prevail. And so I say to you -- And so \\r\\nI say to you and to \\r\\nothers around the world, whether you wish us well or ill: do not underestimate \\r\\nus Americans. We lack neither strength nor wisdom. There\\'s a road that leads to \\r\\na bright and hopeful future. What America needs is leadership. Our job, my \\r\\nfellow Americans, is to ensure that the leaders of this great country will be \\r\\nJohn Kerry and John Edwards. Thank you and God bless America!',\n",
       " 'President Obama has spent many days now consulting with Congress and talking with leaders around the world about the situation in Syria. And last night, the President asked all of us on his national security team to consult with the leaders of Congress as well, including the leadership of the Congressional national security committees. And he asked us to consult about what we know regarding the horrific chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs last week. I will tell you that as someone who has spent nearly three decades in the United States Congress, I know that that consultation is the right way for a president to approach a decision of when and how and if to use military force. And it\\x92s important to ask the tough questions and get the tough answers before taking action, not just afterwards. And I believe, as President Obama does, that it is also important to discuss this directly with the American people. That\\x92s our responsibility, to talk with the citizens who have entrusted all of us in the Administration and the Congress with the responsibility for their security. That\\x92s why this morning\\x92s release of ourgovernment\\x92s unclassified estimate of what took place in Syriais so important. Its findings are as clear as they are compelling. I\\x92m not asking you to take my word for it. Read for yourself, everyone, those listening. All of you, read for yourselves the evidence from thousands of sources, evidence that is already publicly available, and read for yourselves the verdict reached by our intelligence community about the chemical weapons attack the Assad regime inflicted on the opposition and on opposition-controlled or contested neighborhoods in the Damascus suburbs on the early morning of August 21st. Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed information regarding this attack, and I will tell you it has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience. We will not repeat that moment. Accordingly, we have taken unprecedented steps to declassify and make facts available to people who can judge for themselves. But still, in order to protect sources and methods, some of what we know will only be released to members of Congress, the representatives of the American people. That means that some things we do know we can\\x92t talk about publicly. So what do we really know that we can talk about? Well, we know that the Assad regime has the largest chemical weapons program in the entire Middle East. We know that the regime has used those weapons multiple times this year and has used them on a smaller scale, but still it has used them against its own people, including not very far from where last Wednesday\\x92s attack happened. We know that the regime was specifically determined to rid the Damascus suburbs of the opposition, and it was frustrated that it hadn\\x92t succeeded in doing so. We know that for three days before the attack the Syrian regime\\x92s chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area making preparations. And we know that the Syrian regime elements were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking precautions associated with chemical weapons. We know that these were specific instructions. We know where the rockets were launched from and at what time. We know where they landed and when. We know rockets came only from regime-controlled areas and went only to opposition-controlled or contested neighborhoods. And we know, as does the world, that just 90 minutes later all hell broke loose in the social media. With our own eyes we have seen the thousands of reports from 11 separate sites in the Damascus suburbs. All of them show and report victims with breathing difficulties, people twitching with spasms, coughing, rapid heartbeats, foaming at the mouth, unconsciousness and death. And we know it was ordinary Syrian citizens who reported all of these horrors. And just as important, we know what the doctors and the nurses who treated them didn\\x92t report -- not a scratch, not a shrapnel wound, not a cut, not a gunshot wound. We saw rows of dead lined up in burial shrouds, the white linen unstained by a single drop of blood. Instead of being tucked safely in their beds at home, we saw rows of children lying side by side sprawled on a hospital floor, all of them dead from Assad\\x92s gas and surrounded by parents and grandparents who had suffered the same fate. The United States Government now knows that at least 1,429 Syrians were killed in this attack, including at least 426 children. Even the first responders, the doctors, nurses, and medics who tried to save them, they became victims themselves. We saw them gasping for air, terrified that their own lives were in danger. This is the indiscriminate, inconceivable horror of chemical weapons. This is what Assad did to his own people. We also know many disturbing details about the aftermath. We know that a senior regime official who knew about the attack confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime, reviewed the impact, and actually was afraid that they would be discovered. We know this. And we know what they did next. I personally called theForeign Minister of Syriaand I said to him, \\x93If, as you say, your nation has nothing to hide, then let the United Nations in immediately and give the inspectors the unfettered access so they have the opportunity to tell your story.\\x94 Instead, for four days they shelled the neighborhood in order to destroy evidence, bombarding block after block at a rate four times higher than they had over the previous 10 days. And when the UN inspectors finally gained access, that access, as we now know, was restricted and controlled. In all of these things that I have listed, in all of these things that we know, all of them, the American intelligence community has high confidence, high confidence. This is common sense. This is evidence. These are facts. So the primary question is really no longer: What do we know? The question is: What are we -- we collectively -- what are we in the world going to do about it? As previous storms in history have gathered, when unspeakable crimes were within our power to stop them, we have been warned against the temptations of looking the other way. History is full of leaders who have warned against inaction, indifference, and especially against silence when it mattered most. Our choices then in history had great consequences and our choice today has great consequences. It matters that nearly a hundred years ago, in direct response to the utter horror and inhumanity of World War I, that the civilized world agreed that chemical weapons should never be used again. That was the world\\x92s resolve then, and that began nearly a century of effort to create a clear redline for the international community. It matters today that we are working as an international community to rid the world of the worst weapons. That\\x92s why we signed agreements like theSTART Treaty, theNew START Treaty, theChemical Weapons Convention, which more than 180 countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, have signed on to. It matters to our security and the security of our allies. It matters to Israel. It matters to our close friends Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon -- all of whom live just a stiff breeze away from Damascus. It matters to all of them where the Syrian chemical weapons are. And if unchecked, they can cause even greater death and destruction to those friends. And it matters deeply to the credibility and the future interests of the United States of America and our allies. It matters because a lot of other countries, whose polices challenges these international norms, are watching. They are watching. They want to see whether the United States and our friends mean what we say. It is directly related to our credibility and whether countries still believe the United States when it says something. They are watching to see if Syria can get away with it, because then maybe they too can put the world at greater risk. And make no mistake, in an increasingly complicated world of sectarian and religious extremist violence, what we choose to do or not do matters in real ways to our own security. Some cite the risk of doing things, but we need to ask, what is the risk of doing nothing? It matters because if we choose to live in a world where a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad can gas thousands of his own people with impunity, even after the United States and our allies said no, and then the world does nothing about it, there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will. This matters also beyond the limits of Syria\\x92s borders. It is about whether Iran, which itself has been a victim of chemical weapons attacks, will now feel emboldened, in the absence of action, to obtain nuclear weapons. It is about Hezbollah, and North Korea, and every other terrorist group or dictator that might ever again contemplate the use of weapons of mass destruction. Will they remember that the Assad regime was stopped from those weapons\\x92 current or future use, or will they remember that the world stood aside and created impunity? So our concern is not just about some far off land oceans away. That\\x92s not what this is about. Our concern with the cause of the defenseless people of Syria is about choices that will directly affect our role in the world and our interests in the world. It is also profoundly about who we are. We are the United States of America. We are the country that has tried, not always successfully, but always tried to honor a set of universal values around which we have organized our lives and our aspirations. This crime against conscience, this crime against humanity, this crime against the most fundamental principles of international community, against the norm of the international community, this matters to us. And it matters to who we are. And it matters to leadership and to our credibility in the world. My friends, it matters here if nothing is done. It matters if the world speaks out in condemnation and then nothing happens. America should feel confident and gratified that we are not alone in our condemnation, and we are not alone in our will to do something about it and to act. The world is speaking out, and many friends stand ready to respond. TheArab Leaguepledged, quote, to hold the Syrian regime \"fully responsible for [the ugly] crime.\\x941TheOrganization for Islamic Cooperationcondemned the regime and said we needed, quote, to \"hold the Syrian Government legally and morally accountable for this heinous crime.\\x942Turkey said there is no doubt that the regime is responsible. Our oldest ally, the French, said the regime, quote, \\x93committed this vile action, and it is an outrage to use weapons that the community has banned for the last 90 years in all international conventions.\\x943The Australian Prime Minister said he didn\\x92t want history to record that we were, quote, \\x93a party to turning such a blind eye.\\x944 So now that we know what we know, the question we must all be asking is: What will we do? Let me emphasize -- President Obama, we in the United States, we believe in the United Nations. And we have great respect for the brave inspectors who endured regime gunfire and obstructions to their investigation. But as Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General, has said again and again, the UN investigation will not affirm who used these chemical weapons. That is not the mandate of the UN investigation. They will only affirm whether such weapons were used. By the definition of their own mandate, the UN can\\x92t tell us anything that we haven\\x92t shared with you this afternoon or that we don\\x92t already know. And because of the guaranteed Russian obstructionism of any action through the UN Security Council, the UN cannot galvanize the world to act as it should. So let me be clear. We will continue talking to the Congress, talking to our allies, and most importantly, talking to the American people. President Obama will ensure that the United States of America makes our own decisions on our own timelines based on our values and our interests. Now, we know that after a decade of conflict, the American people are tired of war. Believe me, I am, too. But fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility. Just longing for peace does not necessarily bring it about. And history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator\\x92s wanton use of weapons of mass destruction against all warnings, against all common understanding of decency. These things we do know. We also know that we have a President who does what he says that he will do. And he has said very clearly that whatever decision he makes in Syria, it will bear no resemblance to Afghanistan, Iraq, or even Libya. It will not involve any boots on the ground. It will not be open-ended. And it will not assume responsibility for a civil war that is already well underway. The President has been clear: Any action that he might decide to take will be a limited and tailored response to ensure that a despot\\x92s brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons is held accountable. And ultimately, ultimately, we are committed -- we remain committed, we believe it\\x92s the primary objective -- is to have a diplomatic process that can resolve this through negotiation, because we know there is no ultimate military solution. It has to be political. It has to happen at the negotiating table, and we are deeply committed to getting there. So that is what we know. That\\x92s what the leaders of Congress now know. And that\\x92s what the American people need to know. And that is at the core of the decisions that must now be made for the security of our country and for the promise of a planet where the world\\x92s most heinous weapons must never again be used against the world\\x92s most vulnerable people. Thank you very much.',\n",
       " 'Well, good evening, and it\\x92s wonderful to be back inThe Hague. I want to thank my colleague and friend,Foreign Minister Rosenthal, a longtime friend, and co-conspirator from time to time,Eric Schmidt. Also, thanks to Leon Willems, the director of theFree Press Unlimited, and to those of my colleagues whom I know are here, namelyCarl Bildt, an incredibly connected foreign minister, along with other ministers, ambassadors, the diplomatic community, and ladies and gentlemen. It\\x92s a pleasure to join you here today to discuss this issue, because we think it is vitally important to every nation represented and every nation in the world; namely, internet freedom. And I want to thank Uri and the Netherlands for hosting this conference, which is a reflection of your long tradition of defending and advancing people\\x92s human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere, including online. And thanks as well to the representatives of nearly two dozen other governments here, all of whom I know will be working to get real solutions and recommendations agreed to tomorrow. I\\x92m pleased we also have representatives from the private sector and civil society. So it all adds up to a multi-stakeholder event. Now, in two days, on December 10th, we\\x92ll celebrateHuman Rights Day, which is the anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And in the 63 years since that achievement, the world has been implementing a global commitment around the rights and freedoms of people everywhere, no matter where they live or who they are. And today, as people increasingly turn to the internet to conduct important aspects of their lives, we have to make sure that human rights are as respected online as offline. After all, the right to express one\\x92s views, practice one\\x92s faith, peacefully assemble with others to pursue political or social change -- these are all rights to which all human beings are entitled, whether they choose to exercise them in a city square or an internet chat room. And just as we have worked together since the last century to secure these rights in the material world, we must work together in this century to secure them in cyberspace. This is an urgent task. It is most urgent, of course, for those around the world whose words are now censored, who are imprisoned because of what they or others have written online, who are blocked from accessing entire categories of internet content, or who are being tracked by governments seeking to keep them from connecting with one another. In Syria, a blogger named Anas Maarawi was arrested on July 1st after demanding that President Asad leave. He\\x92s not been charged with anything, but he remains in detention. In both Syria and Iran, many other online activists -- actually too many to name -- have been detained, imprisoned, beaten, and even killed for expressing their views and organizing their fellow citizens. And perhaps the most well known blogger in Russia,Alexei Navalny, was sentenced on Tuesday to 15 days in jail after he took part in protests over the Russian elections. In China, several dozen companies signed a pledge in October, committing to strengthen their (quote) \"self-management, self-restraint, and strict self-discipline.\" Now, if they were talking about fiscal responsibility, we might all agree. But they were talking about offering web-based services to the Chinese people, which is code for getting in line with the government\\x92s tight control over the internet. Now, these and many other incidents worldwide remind us of the stakes in this struggle. And the struggle does not belong only to those on the front lines and who are suffering. It belongs to all of us: first, because we all have a responsibility to support human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere. Second, because the benefits of the network grow as the number of users grow. The internet is not exhaustible or competitive. My use of the internet doesn\\x92t diminish yours. On the contrary, the more people that are online and contributing ideas, the more valuable the entire network becomes to all the other users. In this way, all users, through the billions of individual choices we make about what information to seek or share, fuel innovation, enliven public debates, quench a thirst for knowledge, and connect people in ways that distance and cost made impossible just a generation ago. But when ideas are blocked, information deleted, conversations stifled, and people constrained in their choices, the internet is diminished for all of us. What we do today to preserve fundamental freedoms online will have a profound effect on the next generation of users. More than two billion people are now connected to the internet, but in the next 20 years, that number will more than double. And we are quickly approaching the day when more than a billion people are using the internet in repressive countries. The pledges we make and the actions we take today can help us determine whether that number grows or shrinks, or whether the meaning of being on the internet is totally distorted. Delivering on internet freedom requires cooperative actions, and we have to foster a global conversation based on shared principles and with the right partners to navigate the practical challenges of maintaining an internet that is open and free while also interoperable, secure, and reliable. Now, this enterprise isn\\x92t a matter of negotiating a single document and calling the job done. It requires an ongoing effort to reckon with the new reality that we live in, in a digital world, and doing so in a way that maximizes its promise. Because the advent of cyberspace creates new challenges and opportunities in terms of security, the digital economy, and human rights, we have to be constantly evolving in our responses. And though they are distinct, they are practically inseparable, because there isn\\x92t an economic internet, a social internet, and a political internet. There is just the internet, and we\\x92re here to protect what makes it great. Tomorrow\\x92s sessions provide the opportunity for us to make concrete progress. At this kickoff event, I\\x92d like to briefly discuss three specific challenges that defenders of the internet must confront. The first challenge is for the private sector to embrace its role in protecting internet freedom, because whether you like it or not, the choices that private companies make have an impact on how information flows or doesn\\x92t flow on the internet and mobile networks. They also have an impact on what governments can and can\\x92t do, and they have an impact on people on the ground. In recent months, we\\x92ve seen cases where companies, products, and services were used as tools of oppression. Now, in some instances, this cannot be foreseen, but in others, yes, it can. A few years ago, the headlines were about companies turning over sensitive information about political dissidents. Earlier this year, they were about a company shutting down the social networking accounts of activists in the midst of a political debate. Today\\x92s news stories are about companies selling the hardware and software of repression to authoritarian governments. When companies sell surveillance equipment to the security agency of Syria or Iran or, in past times, Kaddafi, there can be no doubt it will be used to violate rights. Now, there are some who would say that in order to compel good behavior by businesses, responsible governments should simply impose broad sanctions, and that will take care of the problem. Well, it\\x92s true that sanctions and export controls are useful tools, and the United States makes vigorous use of them when appropriate; and if they are broken, we investigate and pursue violators. And we\\x92re always seeking to work with our partners, such as the European Union, to make them as smart and effective as possible. Just last week, for example, we were glad to see our EU partners impose new sanctions on technology going to Syria. So sanctions are part of the solution, but they are not the entire solution. Dual-use technologies and third-party sales make it impossible to have a sanctions regime that perfectly prevents bad actors from using technologies in bad ways. Now, sometimes companies say to us at the State Department, \"Just tell us what to do, and we\\x92ll do it.\" But the fact is, you can\\x92t wait for instructions. In the 21st century, smart companies have to act before they find themselves in the crosshairs of controversy. I wish there were, but there isn\\x92t, an easy formula for this. Making good decisions about how and whether to do business in various parts of the world, particularly where the laws are applied haphazardly or they are opaque, takes critical thinking and deliberation and asking hard questions. So what kind of business should you do in a country where it has a history of violating internet freedom? Is there something you can do to prevent governments from using your products to spy on their own citizens? Should you include warnings to consumers? How will you handle requests for information from security authorities when those requests come without a warrant? Are you working to prevent post-purchase modifications of your products or resale through middlemen to authoritarian regimes? Now, these and others are difficult questions, but companies must ask them. And the rest of us stand ready to work with you to find answers and to hold those who ignore or dismiss or deny the importance of this issue accountable. A range of resources emerged in recent years to help companies work through these issues. The UNGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were adopted in June, and theOECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprisesboth advise companies on how to meet responsibilities and carry out due diligence. And theGlobal Network Initiative, which is represented here tonight, is a growing forum where companies can work through challenges with other industry partners, as well as academics, investors, and activists. And of course, companies can always learn from users. TheSilicon Valley Human Rights Conferencein October brought together companies, activists, and experts to discuss real life problems and identify solutions. And some participants issued what they called the Silicon Valley Standard for stakeholders to aspire to. Working through these difficult questions by corporate executives and board members should help shape your practices. Part of the job of responsible corporate management in the 21st century is doing human rights due diligence on new markets, instituting internal review procedures, identifying principles by which decisions are to be made in tough situations, because we cannot let the short-term gains that all of us think are legitimate and worth seeking jeopardize the openness of the internet and human rights of individuals who use it without it coming back to haunt us all in the future. Because a free and open internet is important not just to technology companies but to all companies. Whether it\\x92s run with a single mobile phone or an extensive corporate network, it\\x92s hard to find any business today that doesn\\x92t depend in some way on the internet and doesn\\x92t suffer when networks are constrained. And also I would add that, in this day, brand and reputation are precious corporate assets. Companies that put them at risk when they are careless about freedom of the internet can often pay a price. So I think it\\x92s particularly appropriate and important that the private sector is strongly represented at this meeting and that Google is co-hosting tonight\\x92s event. In both securing the promise of a free and open internet and managing the risks that new technologies raise, the private sector is a crucial partner. But even as companies must step up, governments must resist the urge to clamp down, and that is the second challenge we face. If we\\x92re not careful, governments could upend the current internet governance framework in a quest to increase their own control. Some governments use internet governance issues as a cover for pushing an agenda that would justify restricting human rights online. We must be wary of such agendas and united in our shared conviction that human rights apply online. So right now, in various international forums, some countries are working to change how the internet is governed. They want to replace the current multi-stakeholder approach, which includes governments, the private sector, and citizens, and supports the free flow of information, in a single global network. In its place, they aim to impose a system cemented in a global code that expands control over internet resources, institutions, and content, and centralizes that control in the hands of governments.  Now, in a way, that isn\\x92t surprising, because governments have never met a voice or public sphere they didn\\x92t want to control at some point or another. They want to control what gets printed in newspapers, who gets into universities, what companies get oil contracts, what churches and NGOs get registered, where citizens can gather, so why not the internet? But it\\x92s actually worse than that. It\\x92s not just that they want governments to have all the control by cutting out civil society and the private sector; they also want to empower each individual government to make their own rules for the internet that not only undermine human rights and the free flow of information but also the interoperability of the network. In effect, the governments pushing this agenda want to create national barriers in cyberspace. This approach would be disastrous for internet freedom. More government control will further constrict what people in repressive environments can do online. It would also be disastrous for the internet as a whole, because it would reduce the dynamism of the internet for everyone. Fragmenting the global internet by erecting barriers around national internets would change the landscape of cyberspace. In this scenario, the internet would contain people in a series of digital bubbles, rather than connecting them in a global network. Breaking the internet into pieces would give you echo chambers rather than an innovative global marketplace of ideas. The United States wants the internet to remain a space where economic, political, and social exchanges flourish. To do that, we need to protect people who exercise their rights online, and we also need to protect the internet itself from plans that would undermine its fundamental characteristics. Now, those who push these plans often do so in the name of security. And let me be clear: The challenge of maintaining security and of combating cyber crime, such as the theft of intellectual property, are real -- a point I underscore whenever I discuss these issues. There are predators, terrorists, traffickers on the internet, malign actors plotting cyber attacks, and they all need to be stopped. We can do that by working together without compromising the global network, its dynamism, or our principles. Now, there\\x92s a lot to be said about cyber security. I won\\x92t go into that tonight. I\\x92ll be talking about it more, but my basic point is that the United States supports the public-private collaboration that now exists to manage the technical evolution of the internet in real time. We support the principles of multi-stakeholder internet governance developed by more than 30 nations in the OECD earlier this year. A multi-stakeholder system brings together the best of governments, the private sector, and civil society. And most importantly, it works. It has kept the internet up and running for years all over the world. So to use an American phrase, our position is, \"If it ain\\x92t broke, don\\x92t fix it.\" And there\\x92s no good reason to replace an effective system with an oppressive one. The third and final challenge is that all of us -- governments, private, sector, civil society, must do more to build a truly global coalition to preserve an open internet. And that\\x92s where all of you here today come in, because internet freedom cannot be defended by one country or one region alone. Building this global coalition is hard, partly because for people in many countries the potential of the internet is still unrealized. While it\\x92s easy for us in the United States or in the Netherlands to imagine what we would lose if the internet became less free, it is harder for those who have yet to see the benefit of the internet in their day to day lives. So we have to work harder to make the case that an open internet is and will be in everyone\\x92s best interests. And we have to keep that in mind as we work to build this global coalition and make the case to leaders of those countries where the next generation of internet users live. These leaders have an opportunity today to help ensure that the full benefits are available to their people tomorrow, and in so doing, they will help us ensure an open internet for everyone. So the United States will be making the case for an open internet in our work worldwide, and we welcome other countries to join us. As our coalition expands, countries like Ghana and Kenya, represented here tonight, Mongolia, Chile, also represented, I saw, Indonesia and others are sure to be effective at bringing other potential partners on board who have perspectives that can help us confront and answer difficult questions. And new players from governments, the private sector, and civil society will be participating in managing the internet in coming decades as billions more people from all different regions go online. So let\\x92s lay the groundwork now for these partnerships that will support an open internet in the future. And in that spirit, I want to call attention to two important items on your agenda for tomorrow. The first will be to build support for a new cross-regional group that will work together in exactly the way that I\\x92ve just discussed, based on shared principles, providing a platform for governments to engage creatively and energetically with the private sector, civil society, and other governments. Several countries have already signaled their intention to join. I hope others here will do the same, and going forward, others will endorse the declaration that our Dutch hosts have prepared. It\\x92s excellent work, Uri, and we thank you for your leadership. The second item I want to highlight is a practical effort to do more to support cyber activists and bloggers who are threatened by their repressive governments. TheCommittee to Protect Journalistsrecently reported that of all the writers, editors, and photojournalists now imprisoned around the world, nearly half are online journalists. The threat is very real. Now, several of us already provide support, including financial support, to activists and bloggers, and I was pleased that the EU recently announced new funding for that purpose. And I know that other governments, including the Netherlands, are also looking for ways to help out. By coordinating our efforts, we can make them go further and help more people. Earlier, I heard what the foreign minister here is proposing. And we have talked about creating a digital defenders partnership to be part of this global effort. We hope tomorrow\\x92s meetings will give us a chance to discuss with other potential partners how such a partnership could work. So while we meet here in the Netherlands in this beautiful city to talk about how to keep the internet open, unfortunately some countries are pulling very hard in the opposite direction. They\\x92re trying to erect walls between different activities online, economic exchanges, political discussions, religious expression, social interaction, and so on. They want to keep what they like and which doesn\\x92t threaten them and suppress what they don\\x92t. But there are opportunity costs for trying to be open for business but closed for free expression, costs to a nation\\x92s education system, political stability, social mobility, and economic potential. And walls that divide the internet are easier to erect than to maintain. Our government will continue to work very hard to get around every barrier that repressive governments put up, because governments that have erected barriers will eventually find themselves boxed in, and they will face the dictator\\x92s dilemma. They will have to choose between letting the walls fall or paying the price for keeping them standing by resorting to greater repression and to escalating the opportunity cost of missing out on the ideas that have been blocked and the people who have disappeared. I urge countries everywhere, instead of that alternative dark vision, join us here today in the bet that we are making, a bet that an open internet will lead to stronger, more prosperous countries. This is not a bet on computers or mobile phones. It\\x92s a bet on the human spirit. It\\x92s a bet on people. And we\\x92re confident that together, with our partners and government, the private sector, and civil society around the world, who have made this same bet like all of you here tonight, we will preserve the internet as open and secure for all. On the eve of Human Rights Day, this meeting reminds us of the timeless principles that should be our north star. And a look at the world around us and the way it is changing reminds us there is no auto-pilot steering us forward. We have to work in good faith and engage in honest debate, and we have to join together to solve the challenges and seize the opportunities of this exciting digital age. Thank you all for being committed to that goal and that vision. The United States pledges our support and our partnership going forward. Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " \"I thank the Chair. Mr. President, my fourth and final term as a United States Senator will soon come to an end. As I reflect on that reality, I am of course filled with many emotions, but the one that I feel most is gratitude: Gratitude first to God, Creator of Life and Law, Whose loving -- without Whose loving-kindness nothing would be possible. Gratitude to America, this extraordinary land of opportunity, which has given someone like me so many opportunities. Gratitude to the people of Connecticut, who have entrusted me with the privilege of public service for 40 years, the last 24 in the United States Senate. Gratitude to my Senate colleagues whom I have come to know as friends, and with whom it has been such an honor to serve. Gratitude to all of the people without whose help, hard work, and support I would never have made it to the Senate or stayed here -- the gifted and hard-working staff who informed and enriched my service here, and the volunteers in my campaigns who gave so much and asked for nothing in return, except that I do what I believed was right. Gratitude to all of those who labor out of view in the corridors of this Capitol Building, from the maintenance crews to the Capitol Police and everybody else anywhere in this building, thank you for keeping our Capitol running and keeping us safe. And gratitude, most of all, of course, to my family, for the love, support, and inspiration they have given me every day of my life: my parents, grandparents, and siblings; my children and grandchildren; and Hadassah, my wife of almost thirty years now, the love of my life, who has been my constant companion, supporter, and partner through this amazing adventure. And so, I want to begin this farewell speech by simply saying thank you all. I have a lot to be grateful for. But, being a Senator -- and since this is my farewell speech, I do have a few more things I\\x92d like to say. I am leaving the Senate at a moment in our history when America faces daunting challenges, both domestic and foreign, and when too often our problems seem greater than our government\\x92s ability to solve them. But I can tell you that I remain deeply optimistic about America\\x92s future and constantly inspired by the special destiny that I am convinced is ours as Americans. My optimism is based not in theory or hope, but in American history and personal experience. I think particularly about my time in public life, especially the changes that I have witnessed since I took the oath of office as a Senator on January 3rd, 1989. The fact is that, over the past quarter century, America and the world have become freer and more prosperous. The Iron Curtain was peacefully torn down, and the Soviet empire defeated. The eternal values of freedom and opportunity, on which America was founded and for which we still stand, have made global gains that were once unimaginable. We have seen the spread of democracy from Central Europe to Southeast Asia, and from Latin America to the Middle East. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, in places like China, India, and just about every other corner of the globe. And technological advances have transformed almost every aspect of our daily lives. When I started here in the Senate, a blackberry was a fruit, and tweeting was something only birds do. No more. None of these extraordinary developments happened by accident. In fact, to a significant degree, I would say that they were made possible by the principled leadership of the United States, by the global economy and international system that America created with our diplomacy and protected with our military, and by the unique culture of freedom, innovation, and entrepreneurship that flourishes in our country, and that remains the model and inspiration for the rest of the modernizing world. We have every reason to be proud of the progress of humanity that has happened on America\\x92s watch, and here at home, to be grateful for the countless ways in which our own country has been benefited in the process. We live in a world whose shape and trajectory the United States, more than any other nation, is responsible for. It\\x92s not a perfect world. I know that. But it is a better world than the one we inherited. And in my opinion, it is actually in so many ways a better world than has ever existed before. Here at home, over the past quarter-century, we have moved closer to the more perfect union our Founders sought -- becoming a more free and open society, in ways, I would guess, those same Founders never could have imagined. Barriers of discrimination and bigotry that just a few decades ago seemed immoveable have been broken, and the doors of opportunity have been opened wider for all Americans -- regardless of race, religion, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, or disability. During my time here in Washington, we\\x92ve had our first female Secretary of State nominated and confirmed, and our first African-American President elected and reelected. It will forever remain one of my deepest honors that -- thanks to Vice President Gore -- I was given the opportunity to be the first Jewish American to be nominated by a major political party for national office. And incidentally, thanks to the American people, grateful to have received, a half million more votes than my opponent on the other side -- but that\\x92s a longer story. So while there is still much work to do, and many problems to be solved, I believe we can and should approach our future with a confidence that is based on the real and substantial progress we have made together. What is required now is to solve the urgent problems we still have. And what is really required to do that leadership -- leadership of the kind that is never easy or common, but which we as Americans know we can summon in times of need, because we have summoned it before. Today I regret to say as I leave the Senate that the greatest obstacle that stands between us and the brighter American future we all want is right here in Washington. It is the partisan polarization of our politics which prevents us from making the principled compromises on which progress in a democracy depends, and right now, which prevents us from restoring our fiscal solvency as a nation. We need bipartisan leadership to break the gridlock in Washington that will unleash all the potential that is in the American people. And so I would respectfully appeal to my colleagues -- especially the twelve new Senators who will take the oath of office for the first time next month. I know how hard each of you has worked to get elected to the United States Senate, and I know that you work so hard, because you wanted to come here to make a difference for the better. There is no magic or mystery about the way to do so in the U.S. Senate. It requires reaching across the aisle and finding partners from the opposite party. It means ultimately putting the interests of country and constituents ahead of the dictates of party and ideology. When I look back at my own career, the legislative achievements I am proudest to have been part of -- passing the Clean Air Act; stopping the genocide in the Balkans; creating the 9/11 Commission and the Department of Homeland Security; reforming the Intelligence Community; reorganizing FEMA: and repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell -- all were achieved only because a critical mass of Democrats and Republicans found common ground. And that is what is desperately needed in Washington now, to solve our nation\\x92s biggest problems and address our nation\\x92s biggest challenges before they become crises or catastrophes. Our future also depends upon our nation continuing to exercise another kind of leadership, and that is leadership beyond our borders. This, too, has never been easy or popular. Americans have rarely been eager to entangle ourselves abroad. Especially at times when we have faced economic difficulties at home, as we do now, there has been temptation to turn inward -- to tell ourselves that the problems of the world are not our responsibility, or that we cannot afford to do anything about them. In fact, the prosperity, security, and freedom of the American people depend more than ever before on what\\x92s happening in the rest of the world -- and so too does the rest of the world depend especially on us. I know we cannot solve all the planet\\x92s problems by ourselves alone, nor should we try. But the fact is that none of the biggest problems facing the world can or will be solved in the absence of American leadership. Here, too, I appeal to my Senate colleagues, and again, especially those who will take the oath of office for the first time early in January: Do not listen to the political consultants or others who tell you that you shouldn\\x92t spend time on foreign affairs or national security. They\\x92re wrong. The American people need us, the Senate, to stay engaged economically, diplomatically, and militarily in an ever smaller world. Do not underestimate the impact you could have by getting involved in matters of foreign policy and national security -- whether by using your voice to stand in solidarity with those who are struggling for the American ideal of freedom in their own countries across the globe, or working to strengthen the foreign policy and national security institutions of our own country, or by rallying our citizens to embrace the role that we as a country must play on the world stage, as both our interests and our values demand. None of the challenges we face today, in a still dangerous world, is beyond our ability to meet. Just as we ended the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, we can stop the slaughter in Syria. Just as we nurtured the Democratic transition after communism fell in Central and Eastern Europe, we can support the forces of freedom in the Middle East today. And just as we were able to prevail in the long struggle against the Soviet Union during the Cold War, we can prevail in the global conflict with Islamist extremism and terrorism that we were forced into by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But all that too will require leadership in the United State Senate -- It will require leaders who will stand against the siren song of isolationism, who will defend our defense and foreign assistance budgets, who will support \\x96 when necessary -- the use of America\\x92s military power against our enemies in the world and who will have the patience and determination when the public grows weary to see our battles through until they are won. Mr. President, I first set foot in this chamber almost exactly fifty years ago -- in the summer of 1963, inspired, like so many of my generation, by President John F. Kennedy and his call to service. I spent that summer right here in the Senate, as an intern for my home state Senator, Abe Ribicoff. He was and remains another personal hero of mine. And although I would never have admitted so publicly back then, because it was so presumptuous, I came away from that experience with the dream that I might someday, somehow, return to serve in this place. Well, I have been blessed to live that dream. And that is what America is about. We have always been a nation of dreamers, whose destiny is determined only by the bounds of our own imagination, and by our willingness to work hard to realize what we have imagined. Indeed, long before the United States came into being as a government of institutions and laws, it was a dream -- a dream, an implausible and\\xa0incredible dream, of a country not defined by its borders or its rulers or the ethnicity of its founders, but by a set of eternal and universal principles -- that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are God\\x92s endowment to each of us. That was the dream that gave us our existence and our purpose as a nation, and it is the dream that for more than two hundred years, through every passing generation, has been reinventing, renewing, enthralling, and surprising us -- the very dreamers who are living the dream. I leave this chamber as full of faith in the dream called America, as when I stood here nearly a quarter of a century ago to take the oath of office for the first time -- and as when I first came here, nearly a half century ago, as a twenty-one year old, the grandchild of four immigrants to America, the son of wonderful parents who never had the opportunity even to go to college but made sure my sisters and I did, and gave us the confidence to pursue our dreams, which was their American dream for us. America remains a land of dreams and a nation of dreamers. I know that my own story repeats itself today in millions of American families and their children. And as long as that is so, I know that our best days as a country are still ahead of us. And so, Mr. President, I will end my remarks today where our country began a long time ago -- with a dream and a prayer: that God will continue to bless the United States of America.\",\n",
       " 'So, good afternoon.Konichiwa.I\\'mJoe Aucoin, \\r\\n\\t\\tCommander of7th Fleet.Thanks for coming out here today. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt gives me an \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity to talk to you. We do have a number of Japanese journalists \\r\\n\\t\\twith us, so we\\'re going to do translation and pause for a second.2 So, I just want to start. I got a couple of prepared \\r\\n\\t\\tremarks, and then I\\'ll open it up for questions. As some of you know, \\r\\n\\t\\tyesterday the[USS] Fitzgeraldexperienced extensive damage and flooding as a \\r\\n\\t\\tresult of a collision with aFilipino merchant shipat approximately \\r\\n\\t\\t0220 in the morning, 17 June, 10 miles off the coast of Honshu, Japan, approximately 56 miles south of Tokyo.  The damage was significant. This was not a small collision. It was right \\r\\n\\t\\tnear the pilot\\'s house and there is a big puncture, a big gash, \\r\\n\\t\\tunderneath the waterline also.\\xa0 So the \\r\\n\\t\\tship suffered a lot of damage. Three compartments were severely damaged, \\r\\n\\t\\tone machinery room, and two berthing areas for 116 of the crew, and also \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ship\\'s skipper\\'s cabin, as well. So \\r\\n\\t\\tthis was a severe emergency, but the ship\\'s crew was swift and \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsive, and I can\\'t tell you how proud I am of the crew for what they \\r\\n\\t\\tdid to save the ship. Through the heroic \\r\\n\\t\\tefforts of the ship\\'s crew, they prevented the ship from foundering, or \\r\\n\\t\\teven sinking last night.\\xa0 So they were able \\r\\n\\t\\tto save the ship and they were able to bring it back yesterday on it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\town power, back here to Yokosuka, and you can see the ship behind me. \\r\\n\\t\\tSo the ship and the crew, they performed as \\r\\n\\t\\twe expected, very professionally. They were able to bring the ship back. The ship is called the \"Fighting Fitz.\" It\\'snamed after a lieutenantduring the Vietnam War that was awarded theNavy Crossfor his valor \\r\\n\\t\\tduring the Vietnam War. So we owe it to \\r\\n\\t\\tour families and the Navy to understand what happened. Under my \\r\\n\\t\\tauthority, we will launch aJAGMAN investigationinto this collision. I \\r\\n\\t\\twill appoint aflag officerto lead that investigation, and there will \\r\\n\\t\\talso be a safety investigation.\\xa0 The U.S. \\r\\n\\t\\tCoast Guard is to take the lead on the marine casualty investigation.\\xa0 And we recognize there are other \\r\\n\\t\\torganizations that have vested interests in this incident, and we expect \\r\\n\\t\\tthem to conduct their own separate investigations, and more information \\r\\n\\t\\twill be forthcoming on those investigations.\\xa0 And I\\'m not going to speculate on how long those investigations \\r\\n\\t\\twill take.  As you\\'re aware, we have found the remains of a number ofour missing shipmates, and our deepest \\r\\n\\t\\tsympathies go out to the families of those shipmates. So out of concern for the families and the \\r\\n\\t\\tnotification process, I will decline to state how many we have found at \\r\\n\\t\\tthis time. We owe it to the families and friends of these shipmates and \\r\\n\\t\\thope you can respect this process.\\xa0 So we \\r\\n\\t\\twill update you after the notification process is complete. We have transferred the remains to the Yokosuka Naval \\r\\n\\t\\tHospital. The families are being notified, and are being provided \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport that they all need at this difficult time. Please keep them in your \\r\\n\\t\\tthoughts and prayers.\\xa0 So their loved ones \\r\\n\\t\\tare what make our navy great, the strength of my fleet are my people, so \\r\\n\\t\\tthis loss is something we all feel. The names of the deceased will be \\r\\n\\t\\treleased soon.\\xa0 Unfortunately, we don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\thave the details regarding the conditions during the final moments, but \\r\\n\\t\\thope that the investigation may shed some light on that matter. At the same time, I really would like to \\r\\n\\t\\texpress my heartfelt thanks to our Japanese allies, particularly theJapanese Maritime Self Defense Force, with their tremendous support. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey are with us the whole time, and they really helped us out a lot.\\xa0 Also, theJapanese Coast Guardhelped us \\r\\n\\t\\ta lot with their helicopters, and they were the first on the scene.\\r\\n\\t\\tWe \\r\\n\\t\\thad to medevac the commanding officer,Commander Bryce Benson, who was medevac\\'d back to the hospital by a JMSDF helicopter.\\xa0 We also had to medevac two other sailors with minor \\r\\n\\t\\tinjuries, and they were medevac\\'d via helicopter back to the Navy \\r\\n\\t\\tYokosuka Hospital, and they are still there undergoing treatment. Since this started, we\\'ve set up a USS \\r\\n\\t\\tFitzgerald Emergency Family Assistance Center within hours, and we\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tdisseminated the phone numbers with hotlines to social media and Navy \\r\\n\\t\\twebsites, for all the families here, and also back in the United States.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tSo this support center remains open for \\r\\n\\t\\tchaplain and counselor care. It\\'s 24/7, and it\\'s over -- located on our \\r\\n\\t\\tbase in the Family Support Center.  But to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe clear, my focus is on the families, the grieving family members, the \\r\\n\\t\\tcrew, and the friends of the USS Fitzgerald.\\xa0 I wish you could have seen it last night when the ship came \\r\\n\\t\\tback. The whole Navy family came together. We had tremendous support \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom everyone within the base, from the Fleet Activities Yokosuka, to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe NWR, USO, Red Cross, from the embassy, from the JMSDF, from the \\r\\n\\t\\tJapanese Coast Guard. It was really gratifying and heartfelt, the \\r\\n\\t\\tresponse we got from everyone, to rally around our ship upon it\\'s return. So\\r\\n\\t\\tI ask you to keep thoughts and prayers for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe family members and the crew. And please respect their privacy as we \\r\\n\\t\\twork through this, as we get answers to some of the questions I\\'m sure \\r\\n\\t\\tthat are out there, with the investigation.\\xa0 So the next update will be at 6 p.m. Thank you for coming out \\r\\n\\t\\there, and I\\'ll answer questions from you.   Question:Vice Admiral, thank you for doing this briefing; two \\r\\n\\t\\tquick questions. Firstly, the damage was sustained on the starboard side \\r\\n\\t\\tof the Fitzgerald. There\\'s some speculation that would indicate that it \\r\\n\\t\\twas at fault, in this case based on the maritime procedures where ships \\r\\n\\t\\twith the other ship on the starboard side is supposed to give way. Can \\r\\n\\t\\tyou comment on that? And secondly, will you be giving the Japanese \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation access to the crew of the Fitzgerald? Vice Admiral \\r\\n\\t\\tAucoin:Yeah, you know, I\\'m not going to speculate on what \\r\\n\\t\\thappened, but it will be a full and thorough investigation. But for me \\r\\n\\t\\tto say what happened at 2:20 in the morning, yesterday, unknown. So we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to appoint a flag officer. We\\'re going to cooperate with all the \\r\\n\\t\\tstakeholders in this, especially the Japanese, but we\\'ll get those \\r\\n\\t\\tanswers. I don\\'t have them right now. I would just add too, you\\'re right. It\\'s on the right side \\r\\n\\t\\tof the ship, so you can\\'t see it from here. But it was extensive damage. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou can tell from the way the ship is listing that it was significant, \\r\\n\\t\\tand really I\\'m proud of the crew, how they reacted and were able to save \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ship. Question:Thank you for this opportunity. You said \\r\\n\\t\\tyou\\'re launching the investigation. Does that mean you are going to \\r\\n\\t\\tdecide the right of our jurisdiction given to you by the agreement \\r\\n\\t\\tbetween Japanese and U.S. governments, and that means you are not going \\r\\n\\t\\tto \\r\\n\\t\\tlet Japanese Coast Guard lead the investigation -- is that right? Vice Admiral \\r\\n\\t\\tAucoin:I\\'m not going to -- There \\r\\n\\t\\twill be a number of investigations. I know, under my authority, I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to do a JAGMAN investigation. That\\'s a Judge Advocate General Manual \\r\\n\\t\\tInvestigation, and then appoint a flag officer. There\\'s at least two other \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigations, and of course, we want to cooperate with the Japanese if \\r\\n\\t\\tthey want to do an investigation. We will work hand in hand with our \\r\\n\\t\\tJapanese partners. Question:You might allow Japanese Coast \\r\\n\\t\\tGuard to interview some sailors? Vice Admiral \\r\\n\\t\\tAucoin:Yes, we will cooperate fully. Question:This is Tim Kelly \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom Reuters. You say the damage is significant. The ship [inaudible]. Is the \\r\\n\\t\\tship salvageable, and will you scrap it or would you, if the repairs are \\r\\n\\t\\tundertaken, are we talking weeks, months, years...Can you give us some \\r\\n\\t\\tindication? Vice Admiral Aucoin:Yeah, \\r\\n\\t\\tTim, the damage is significant. Right now the focus is on the crew \\r\\n\\t\\tand the families. The ship is salvageable. It\\'s extensive though. It \\r\\n\\t\\twill require some significant repairs. But you will see the USS \\r\\n\\t\\tFitzgerald back as one of our warships here, but it will require some \\r\\n\\t\\ttime. Question:It will take months? Over a year maybe? Vice Admiral Aucoin:I think it will \\r\\n\\t\\ttake months, hopefully under a year.  Question:[English interpreter for \\r\\n\\t\\tquestion asked by reporter in Japanese language.] So, thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou very much for having this press conference. The sailors who were \\r\\n\\t\\tmissing, do we know where they are yet? Have you found anything of the \\r\\n\\t\\tones who are still missing? Vice Admiral Aucoin:Yes, we have. But I\\'m not \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to go, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we want to, out of respect for the families, as far as \\r\\n\\t\\tidentification, notifying next of kin, we have found a number of our \\r\\n\\t\\tmissing shipmates. But I\\'m not going to go into the exact numbers. Question:Thank you, I\\'m from the Washington Post. Can you tell us how many bridge \\r\\n\\t\\tcrews were on duty at the time of the collision, please? And was all the \\r\\n\\t\\tnavigational equipment working correctly? Vice Admiral Aucoin:I don\\'t have the exact \\r\\n\\t\\tnumber of the crew, but I\\'m sure they had a full complement, what\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tnormally expected during a watch. As far as to the systems and all \\r\\n\\t\\tthat, we\\'re going to do an investigation to find out what exactly \\r\\n\\t\\thappened. Question:Janis for \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible] and NBC. Just to clarify on the sailors who were considered \\r\\n\\t\\tmissing, are you saying that the search is now called off? That you \\r\\n\\t\\tconsider that you have no more sailors who are still missing? Vice Admiral Aucoin:We\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscontinued the search and rescue. We have found a number of them. I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\tnot going to go into the number, but hopefully here very soon -- and this is \\r\\n\\t\\tout of respect for the family, you\\'ve gotta understand that, that we \\r\\n\\t\\twant to make sure that we have the notification done to the grieving \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies. We don\\'t want to come out with something prematurely. We want \\r\\n\\t\\tto \\r\\n\\t\\tmake sure the family members are notified, so I am not being very \\r\\n\\t\\tdefinitive on this. So please work with us on that. As soon as we have \\r\\n\\t\\tthat notification process done, we will come out with the names and more \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation. Question:The search is finished. The search is over. Vice Admiral \\r\\n\\t\\tAucoin:The \\r\\n\\t\\tsearch and rescue is over. Question:Admiral, Alexandra Field, \\r\\n\\t\\tCNN. First of all, our condolences to all those who are grieving -- Vice Admiral Aucoin:Thank you. Question:-- in the Navy and family members, today. This \\r\\n\\t\\tis delicate; this is sensitive, right now. We understand that. Is there \\r\\n\\t\\tanything that you can share about these circumstances that those sailors \\r\\n\\t\\twere facing in those few moments down in those berthing areas? Do we \\r\\n\\t\\tknow if these sailors were awake at the time of collision? If they were \\r\\n\\t\\tawake afterwards? If they tried to escape? And also, if you could just \\r\\n\\t\\tvery briefly give us the mechanics of this crash. Are we talking about a \\r\\n\\t\\tT-bone a side-swiping? Were there any calls for help in advance? Were \\r\\n\\t\\tany efforts to maneuver to avoid a collision tried at all? Vice Admiral Aucoin:Okay. \\r\\n\\t\\tThanks for your comments there. So it was at 2:20 in the morning. We do \\r\\n\\t\\thave watch teams that are awake throughout the night, but a significant \\r\\n\\t\\tpart of the crew was sleeping. And as I said before, two compartments \\r\\n\\t\\tthat housed 116 of the crew are in those compartments, and it was a \\r\\n\\t\\tsignificant impact to the side of the ship. And you can\\'t see most of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe damage. The damage is mostly underneath the waterline and it\\'s a \\r\\n\\t\\tlarge gash near the keel of the ship and so the water flow was \\r\\n\\t\\ttremendous. And so there wasn\\'t a lot of time in those spaces that were open to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe sea. And as you can see now, the ship is still listing, and so they had to \\r\\n\\t\\tfight the ship to keep it above the surface. And so it was traumatic. As to how \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch warning they had, I don\\'t know. That\\'s going to be found out during \\r\\n\\t\\tthe investigation. But it was a significant impact that the crew had to \\r\\n\\t\\tfight very hard to keep the ship afloat. Question:And on the \\r\\n\\t\\tmechanics of the crash itself, sideswipe, T-bone, calls for helps, \\r\\n\\t\\tefforts to maneuver to avoid it [inaudible]. Vice Admiral \\r\\n\\t\\tAucoin:I don\\'t know those kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tthings, but it was a significant impact to the side of the ship. In \\r\\n\\t\\torder to get a puncture like that, I\\'ll just leave that they were hit on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe side by the tanker, 29,000 ton merchant freighter. Question:Is \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Commander stable enough to answer any questions at this point? Vice Admiral Aucoin:He \\r\\n\\t\\twas medevac\\'d. His cabin was destroyed. He\\'s lucky to be alive and he\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tat the hospital right now. He\\'s undergoing treatment, but he\\'s not \\r\\n\\t\\tavailable for questions.',\n",
       " '*Thank you very much,Senator Fulbright,Senator Javits,Senator Symington,Senator Pell.* I would like to say for the record that -- and also for the men behind me who are also wearing the uniform and their medals -- that my sitting up here is really symbolic. I\\'m not here as John Kerry. I\\'m here as one member of a group of 1000, which is a small representation of a very much larger group of veterans in this country. And were it possible for all of them to sit at this table, they would be here and have the same kind of testimony. I would simply like to speak in very general terms. I -- I apologize if my statement is general because I received notification yesterday you would hear me, and I\\'m afraid, because of the injunction, I was up most of the night and haven\\x92t had a great deal of chance to prepare. I would like to talk representing all those veterans and say that several months ago in Detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged, and many very highly decorated, veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia. *These were*not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command. It\\'s impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit -- the emotions in the room and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam. But they did. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do. They told the stories of times that they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in the fashion reminiscent ofGenghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country. We call this investigation the \"Winter Soldier Investigation.\" The termWinter Soldieris a play on words of Thomas Paine\\'s in 1776 whenhe spoke of the Sunshine Patriotand summertime soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough. And we who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country; and we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam. But we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, not redcoats but the crimes which we\\x92re committing are what threaten it; and we have to speak out. I would like to talk to you a little bit about what the result is of -- of the feelings these men carry with them after coming back from Vietnam. The country doesn\\x92t know it yet but it\\x92s created a monster, a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence, and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history; men who have returned with a sense of anger and a sense of betrayal which no one has yet grasped. As a veteran, and one who feels this anger, I\\x92d like to talk about it. We\\x92re angry because we feel we have been used in the worst fashion by the Administration of this country. In 1970 at West Point, Vice President Agnew said: And this was used as a rallying point for our effort in Vietnam. But for us, his boys in Asia whom the country was supposed to support, his statement is a terrible distortion from which we can only draw a very deep sense of revulsion; and hence the anger of some of the men who are here in Washington today. It\\x92s a distortion because we in no way considered ourselves the best men of this country; because those he calls misfits were standing up for us in a way that nobody else in this country dared to; because so many who have died would have returned to this country to join the misfits in their efforts to ask for an immediate withdrawal from South Vietnam; because so many of those best men have returned as quadriplegics and amputees, and they lie forgotten in Veterans Administration hospitals in this country which fly the flag which so many have chosen as their own personal symbol. And we cannot consider ourselves America\\x92s best men when we were ashamed of and hated what we were called to do in Southeast Asia. In our opinion, and from our experience, there is nothing in South Vietnam, nothing which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America. And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and it\\x92s that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart. We are probably much more angry than that and I don\\x92t want to go into the foreign policy aspects because I\\x92m outclassed here. I know that all of you have talked about every possible -- every possible alternative to getting out of Vietnam. We understand that. We know that you\\x92ve considered the seriousness of the aspects to the utmost level and I\\x92m not going to try and deal on that. But I want to relate to you the feeling which many of the men who\\x92ve returned to this country express because we are probably angriest about all that we were told about Vietnam and about the mystical war against communism. We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese, whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image, were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from. We found that most people didn\\x92t even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace; and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Vietcong, North Vietnamese, or American. We found also that all too often American men were dying in those rice paddies for want of support from their allies. We saw first hand how monies from American taxes was used for a corrupt dictatorial regime. We saw that many people in this country had a one-sided idea of who was kept free by our flag, as blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties. We saw Vietnam ravaged equally by American bombs as well as by search and destroy missions, as well as by Vietcong terrorism; and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of the havoc on the Vietcong. We rationalized destroying villages in order to save them. We saw America lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly aMy Laiand refused to give up the image of American soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum. We learned the meaning of \"free-fire zones,\" \"shoot anything that moves,\" and we watched while America placed a cheapness on the lives of Orientals. We watched the United States\\' falsification of body counts, in fact the glorification of body counts. We listened while month after month we were told the back of the enemy was about to break. We fought using weapons against \\x93oriental human beings,\\x94 with quotation marks around that. We fought using weapons against those people which I do not believe this country would dream of using were we fighting in a European theater -- or let us say a non-third-world people theater. And so we watched while men charged up hills because a general said \"That hill has to be taken.\" And after losing one platoon or two platoons they marched away to leave the hill for the reoccupation of the North Vietnamese; because -- because we watched pride allow the most unimportant of battles to be blown into extravaganzas; because we couldn\\x92t lose, and we couldn\\x92t retreat, and because it didn\\x92t matter how many American bodies were lost to prove that point. And so there wereHamburger HillsandKhe SanhsandHill 881\\'sandFire Base 6\\'s, and so many others. And now we\\x92re told that the men who fought there must watch quietly while American lives are lost so that we can exercise the incredible arrogance of Vietnamizing the Vietnamese. Each day -- Each -- Committee Chair (Sen. Fulbright):I hope you won\\x92t interrupt [to audience who applauded Mr. Kerry\\'s immediately preceding remarks]. He\\x92s making a very significant statement. And let him proceed. Mr. Kerry:Each day to facilitate the process by which the United States washes her hands of Vietnam, someone has to give up his life so that United States doesn\\x92t have to admit something that the entire world already knows, so that we cannot say that we\\x92ve made a mistake. Someone has to die so that President Nixon won\\x92t be, and these are his words, \\x93the first [American] President to lose a war.\\x942 And we are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake? But we\\x92re trying to do that, and we\\x92re doing it with thousands of rationalizations, and if you read carefully the President\\x92s last speech to the people of this country, you can see that he says, and says clearly: But the point is they\\x92re not a free people now -- under us. They\\x92re not a free people. And we cannot fight communism all over the world, and I think we should have learnt that lesson by now.  But the problem of veterans goes beyond this personal problem, because you think about a poster in this country with a picture ofUncle Samand the picture says \\x93I want you.\\x94 And a young man comes out of high school and says, \\x93That\\x92s fine. I\\x92m going to serve my country.\\x94 And he goes to Vietnam and he shoots and he kills and he does his job or maybe he doesn\\x92t kill, maybe he just goes and he comes back. When he gets back to this country he finds that he isn\\x92t really wanted, because the largest unemployment figure in the country -- it varies depending on who you get it from, the Veterans Administration 15 percent, various other sources 22 percent -- but the largest figure of unemployed in this country are veterans of this war. And of those veterans 33 percent of the unemployed are black. That means 1 out of every 10 of the nation\\x92s unemployed is a veteran of Vietnam. The hospitals across the country won\\x92t or can\\x92t meet their demands. It\\x92s not a question of not trying. They haven\\x92t got the appropriations. A man recently died after he had a tracheotomy in California, not because of the operation but because there weren\\x92t enough personnel to clean the mucous out of his tube and he suffocated to death. Another young man just died in a New York VA hospital the other day. A friend of mine was lying in a bed two beds away and tried to help him, but he couldn\\x92t. They rang a bell and there was no one there to service that man, and so he died of convulsions. Fifty-seven percent -- I understand 57 percent of all those entering VA hospitals talk about suicide. Some 27 percent have tried, and they try because they come back to this country and they have to face what they did in Vietnam, and then they come back and find the indifference of a country that doesn\\x92t really care, that doesn\\x92t really care. And suddenly we are faced with a very sickening situation in this country because there\\x92s no moral indignation, and if there is it comes from people who are almost exhausted by their past indignancies, and I know that many of them are sitting in front of me. The country seems to have lied -- lain down and accepted something as serious as Laos, just as we calmly shrugged off theloss of 700,000 lives in Pakistan, the so-called greatest disaster of all times. But we are here as veterans to say that we think we are in the midst of the greatest disaster of all timesnowbecause they are still dying over there, and not just Americans, Vietnamese, and we are rationalizing leaving that country so that those people can go on killing each other for years to come. Americans seem to have accepted the idea that the war is winding down, at least for Americans, and they have also allowed the bodies, which were once used by a President for statistics to prove that we were winning this war, to be used as evidence against a man who followed orders and who interpreted those orders no differently than hundreds of other men in South Vietnam. We veterans can only look with amazement on the fact that this country has not been able to see that there\\'s absolutely no difference between a ground troop and a helicopter crew. And yet, people have accepted a differentiation fed them by the Administration.\\xa0No ground troops are in Laos, so it\\'s alright to kill Laotians by remote control.\\xa0But believe me, the helicopter crews fill the same body bags and they wreak the same kind of damage on the Vietnamese and Laotian countryside as anyone else, and the President is talking about allowing that to go on for many years to come.\\xa0And one can only ask if we will really be satisfied when the troops march in to Hanoi. We are asking here in Washington for some action, action from the Congress of the United States of America which has the power to raise and maintain armies and which by the Constitution also has the power to declare war.\\xa0We\\'ve come here, not to the President, because we believe that this body can be responsive to the will of the people; and we believe that the will of the people says that we should be out of Vietnam now. We\\'re here in Washington also to say that the problem of this war is not just a question of war and diplomacy.\\xa0It\\'s part and parcel of everything that we are trying as human beings to communicate to people in this country:\\xa0the question of racism, which is rampant in the military;\\xa0and so many other questions also:\\xa0the use of weapons;\\xa0the hypocrisy in our taking umbrage in the...Geneva Conventionsand using that as justification for continuation of this war, when we are more guilty than any other body of violations of those Geneva Conventions -- in the use of free-fire zones, harassment interdiction fire, search and destroy missions, the bombings, the torture of prisoners, the killing of prisoners -- accepted policy by many units in South Vietnam. That\\'s what we\\'re trying to say. It\\'s part and parcel of everything. An American Indian friend of mine who lives on theIndian nation of Alcatrazput it to me very succinctly.\\xa0He told me how as a boy on an Indian reservation he had watched television and he used to cheer the cowboys when they came in and shot the Indians. And then suddenly one day he stopped in Vietnam and he said, \"My God, I\\'m doing to these people the very same thing that was done to my people,\" -- and he stopped. And that\\'s what we\\'re trying to say, that we think this thing has to end. We\\'re also here to ask -- We are here to ask and we\\'re here to ask vehemently, Where are the leaders of our country?\\xa0Where is the leadership? We\\'re here to ask:\\xa0Where areMcNamara,Rostow, Bundy4,Gilpatric5, and so many others.\\xa0Where are they now that we the men whom they sent off to war have returned?\\xa0These are commanders who have deserted their troops and there is no more serious crime in the law of war.\\xa0The Army says they never leave their wounded.\\xa0The Marines say they never leave even their dead.\\xa0These men have left all the casualties and retreated behind a pious shield of public rectitude.\\xa0They\\'ve left the real stuff of their reputations, bleaching behind them in the sun in this country. And finally, this Administration has done us the ultimate dishonor.\\xa0They\\'ve attempted to disown us and the sacrifices we made for this country.\\xa0In their blindness and fear, they have tried to deny that we are veterans or that we served in Nam.\\xa0We do not need their testimony.\\xa0Our own scars and stumps of limbs are witness enough for others; and for ourselves, we wish that a merciful God could wipe away our own memories of that service as easily as this Administration has wiped their memories of us. But all that they have done and all that they can do by this denial is to make more clear than ever our own determination to undertake one last mission:\\xa0to search out and destroy the last vestige of this barbaric war, to pacify our own hearts, to conquer the hate and fear that have driven this country these last 10 years and more. And so, when 30 years from now our brothers go down the street without a leg, without an arm or a face, and small boys ask why, we will be able to say \"Vietnam\" and not mean a desert, not a filthy obscene memory but mean instead the place where America finally turned and where soldiers like us helped it in the turning. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Please be seated, everybody. Thank you very, very much.Muchas gracias. Buenos dias.I\\x92m so sorry that we are a little bit late today, but what a beautiful ride in and how wonderful to be here. And I thank you for leaving my future transportation out here in back of me. I love it. Distinguished members of the Cuban delegation -- Josefina, thank you for your leadership and for all your work of your delegation; excellencies from the diplomatic corps; my colleagues from Washington, past and present; Ambassador DeLaurentis and all of the embassy staff; and friends watching around the world, thank you for joining us at this truly historic moment as we prepare to raise the United States flag here at our embassy in Havana, symbolizing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations after 54 years. This is also the first time that a United States Secretary of State has been to Cuba since 1945. This morning I feel very much at home here, and I\\x92m grateful to those who have come to share in this ceremony who are standing around outside of our facilities, and I feel at home here because this is truly a memorable occasion -- a day for pushing aside old barriers and exploring new possibilities. And it is in that spirit that I say on behalf of my country,Los Estados Unidos acogen con beneplacito este nuevo comienzo de su relacion con el pueblo y el Gobierno de Cuba. Sabemos que el camino hacia unas relaciones plenamente normales es largo, pero es precisamente por ello que tenemos que empezar en este mismo instante. No hay nada que temer, ya que seran muchos los beneficios de los que gozaremos cuando permitamos a nuestros ciudadanos conocerse mejor, visitarse con mas frecuencia, realizar negocios de forma habitual, intercambiar ideas y aprender los unos de los otros. My friends, we are gathered here today because our leaders -- President Obama and President Castro -- made a courageous decision to stop being the prisoners of history and to focus on the opportunities of today and tomorrow. This doesn\\x92t mean that we should or will forget the past; how could we, after all? At least for my generation, the images are indelible. In 1959, Fidel Castro came to the United States and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds.Returning the next year for the UN General Assembly, he wasembraced by then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. In 1961, theBay of Pigs tragedyunfolded with President Kennedy accepting responsibility. And in October 1962,the missile crisisarose -- 13 days that pushed us to the very threshold of nuclear war. I was a student then, and I can still remember the taut faces of our leaders, the grim map showing the movement of opposing ships, the approaching deadline, and that peculiar word -- quarantine. We were unsettled and uncertain about the future because we didn\\x92t know when closing our eyes at night what we would find when we woke up. In that frozen environment, diplomatic ties between Washington and this capital city were strained, then stretched thin, then severed. In late 1960, the U.S. ambassador left Havana. Early the following January, Cuba demanded a big cut in the size of our diplomatic mission, and President Eisenhower then decided he had no choice but to shut the embassy down. Most of the U.S. staff departed quickly, but a few stayed behind to hand the keys over to our Swiss colleagues, who would serve diligently and honorably as our protecting power for more than 50 years. I just met with theForeign Minister Didier Burkhalter, and we\\x92re grateful to Switzerland always for their service and their help. Among those remaining at the embassy were three Marine guards: Larry Morris, Mike East, and Jim Tracy. As they stepped outside, they were confronted by a large crowd standing between them and the flagpole. Tensions were high. No one felt safe. But the Marines had a mission to accomplish. And slowly, the crowd just parted in front of them as they made their way to the flagpole, lowered Old Glory, folded it, and returned to the building. Larry, Mike, and Jim had done their jobs, but they also made a bold promise that one day they would return to Havana and raise the flag again. At the time, no one could have imagined how distant that day would be. For more than half a century, U.S.-Cuban relations have been suspended in the amber of Cold War politics. In the interim, a whole generation of Americans and Cubans have grown up and grown old. The United States has had ten new presidents. In a united Germany, the Berlin Wall is a fading memory. Freed from Soviet shackles, Central Europe is again home to thriving democracies. And last week, I was in Hanoi to mark the 20th anniversary of normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam. Think about that. A long and terrible war that inflicted indelible scars on body and mind, followed by two decades of mutual healing, followed by another two decades of diplomatic and commercial engagement. In this period, Vietnam evolved from a country torn apart by violence into a dynamic society with one of the world\\x92s fastest growing economies. And all that time, through reconciliation, through normalization, Cuban-American relations remained locked in the past. Meanwhile, new technologies enabled people everywhere to benefit from shared projects across vast stretches of ocean and land. My friends, it doesn\\x92t take a GPS to realize that the road of mutual isolation and estrangement that the United States and Cuba were traveling was not the right one and that the time has come for us to move in a more promising direction. In the United States, that means recognizing that U.S. policy is not the anvil on which Cuba\\x92s future will be forged. Decades of good intentions aside, the policies of the past have not led to a democratic transition in Cuba. It would be equally unrealistic to expect normalizing relations to have, in a short term, a transformational impact. After all, Cuba\\x92s future is for Cubans to shape. Responsibility for the nature and quality of governance and accountability rests, as it should, not with any outside entity; but solely within the citizens of this country. But the leaders in Havana -- and the Cuban people -- should also know that the United States will always remain a champion of democratic principles and reforms. Like many other governments in and outside this hemisphere, we will continue to urge the Cuban Government to fulfill its obligations under the UN and inter-American human rights covenants -- obligations shared by the United States and every other country in the Americas. And indeed, we remain convinced the people of Cuba would be best served by genuine democracy, where people are free to choose their leaders, express their ideas, practice their faith; where the commitment to economic and social justice is realized more fully; where institutions are answerable to those they serve; and where civil society is independent and allowed to flourish. Let me be clear: The establishment of normal diplomatic relations is not something that one government does as a favor to another; it is something that two countries do together when the citizens of both will benefit. And in this case, the reopening of our embassies is important on two levels: people-to-people and government-to-government. First, we believe it\\x92s helpful for the people of our nations to learn more about each other, to meet each other. That is why we are encouraged that travel from the United States to Cuba has already increased by 35 percent since January and is continuing to go up. We are encouraged that more and more U.S. companies are exploring commercial ventures here that would create opportunities for Cuba\\x92s own rising number of entrepreneurs, and we are encouraged that U.S. firms are interested in helping Cuba expand its telecommunications and internet links, and that the government here recently pledged to create dozens of new and more affordable Wi-Fi hotspots. We also want to acknowledge the special role that the Cuban American community is playing in establishing a new relationship between our countries. And in fact, we have with us this morning representatives from that community, some of whom were born here and others who were born in the United States. With their strong ties of culture and family, they can contribute much to the spirit of bilateral cooperation and progress that we are seeking to create, just as they have contributed much to their communities in their adopted land. The restoration of diplomatic ties will also make it easier for our governments to engage. After all, we are neighbors, and neighbors will always have much to discuss in such areas as civil aviation, migration policy, disaster preparedness, protecting marine environment, global climate change, and other tougher and more complicated issues. Having normal relations makes it easier for us to talk, and talk can deepen understanding even when we know full well we will not see eye to eye on everything. We are all aware that notwithstanding President Obama\\x92s new policy, the overall U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba remains in place and can only be lifted by congressional action -- a step that we strongly favor. For now -- For now, the President has taken steps to ease restrictions on remittances, on exports and imports to help Cuban private entrepreneurs, on telecommunications, on family travel, but we want to go further. The goal of all of these changes is to help Cubans connect to the world and to improve their lives. And just as we are doing our part, we urge the Cuban Government to make it less difficult for their citizens to start businesses, to engage in trade, access information online. The embargo has always been something of a two-way street -- both sides need to remove restrictions that have been holding Cubans back. Before closing, I want to sincerely thank leaders throughout the Americas who have long urged the United States and Cuba to restore normal ties. I thank theHoly Father Pope Francisand the Vatican for supporting the start of a new chapter in relations between our countries. And I think it is not accidental that the Holy Father will come here and then to Washington, the United States at this moment. I applaud President Obama and President Castro both for having the courage to bring us together in the face of considerable opposition. I am grateful toAssistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobsonand her team, to our counterparts in the Cuban Foreign Ministry, to our chief of mission,Ambassador Jeff DeLaurentisand his extraordinary staff, for all of the hard work that has led up to this day. And I just say to our wonderful embassy staff, if you think you\\x92ve been busy these past months, hold on to your seatbelts. But above all, above all, I want to pay tribute to the people of Cuba and to the Cuban American community in the United States.Jose Martionce said that \\x93everything that divides men\\x85is a sin against humanity.\\x94 Clearly, the events of the past -- the harsh words, the provocative and retaliatory actions, the human tragedies -- all have been a source of deep division that has diminished our common humanity. There have been too many days of sacrifice and sorrow; too many decades of suspicion and fear. That is why I am heartened by the many on both sides of the Straits who -- whether because of family ties or a simple desire to replace anger with something more productive -- have endorsed this search for a better path. We have begun to move down that path without any illusions about how difficult it may be. But we are each confident in our intentions, confident in the contacts that we have made, and pleased with the friendships that we have begun to forge. And we are certain that the time is now to reach out to one another, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors -- time to unfurl our flags, raise them up, and let the world know that we wish each other well. Estamos seguros de que este es el momento de acercarnos: dos pueblos ya no enemigos ni rivales, sino vecinos. Es el momento de desplegar nuestras banderas, enarbolarlas y hacerle saber al resto del mundo que nos deseamos lo mejor los unos a los otros. It is with that healing mission in mind that I turn now to Larry Morris, Jim Tracy, and Mike East. Fifty-four years ago, you gentlemen promised to return to Havana and hoist the flag over the United States Embassy that you lowered on that January day long ago. Today, I invite you on behalf of President Obama and the American people to fulfill that pledge by presenting the Stars and Stripes to be raised by members of our current military detachment. Larry, Jim, and Mike, this is your cue to deliver on words that would make any diplomat proud, just as they would any member of the United States Marine Corps: promise made, promise kept. Thank you.',\n",
       " '\\x93I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone \\r\\n\\t\\telse\\'s.\\x94 Senator McCainspoke these heartfelt wordsas he \\r\\n\\t\\taccepted the Republican nomination for\\xa0President in 2008. They were the \\r\\n\\t\\twords of an authentic American hero. We all know how the story goes: A \\r\\n\\t\\tfiery Navy pilot shot down by the North Vietnamese over a lake near \\r\\n\\t\\tHanoi. As his plane spun out of control, he bailed out just in time to \\r\\n\\t\\tplunge into the lake below. That pilot, a youngJohn McCain, was taken \\r\\n\\t\\thostage as a prisoner of war where he spent more than five and a half \\r\\n\\t\\tyears. [For] almost 2000 days,\\xa0 he would endure countless beatings, torture, \\r\\n\\t\\tsolitary confinement, and mental and emotional anguish that none of us \\r\\n\\t\\twill ever have to endure. After getting to know Senator McCain, I felt compelled to visit Vietnam. I \\r\\n\\t\\twanted to see the places where the will of John McCain was tested and \\r\\n\\t\\tforged. I saw the lake. I walked the steps. I sat in the cell. And the ordeal \\r\\n\\t\\tthat my friend survived became all the more real. Many people might \\r\\n\\t\\twonder whata young African-American kid from Minnesotaand \\r\\n\\t\\ta highly \\r\\n\\t\\tdecorated Vietnam War hero-turned-United States Senator might have \\r\\n\\t\\tin common. Well, I...thought of a few: I\\'m black; he was white. I\\'m young; he \\r\\n\\t\\twasn\\'t so young. He lived with physical limitations brought on by war; I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\ta professional athlete. He ran for President; I run out of bounds. He was \\r\\n\\t\\tthe epitome of toughness; and I do everything I can to avoid contact. I \\r\\n\\t\\thave flowing locks; and, well, he didn\\'t. How does this unlikely pair become \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends? I\\'ve asked myself this same question. But do you know what the \\r\\n\\t\\tanswer is? That\\'s just who he is. Over the several years I had the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivilege of spending time with Senator McCain. Sometimes it was just a \\r\\n\\t\\tvisit to our practices. Other times it was him texting and saying, you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, \"You \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to pick it up this Sunday.\" I\\'m thankful that through these moments the \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity that we had to share our lives, and more importantly, our \\r\\n\\t\\tstories.\\r\\n\\t\\tWhile from very different worlds, we developed a meaningful \\r\\n\\t\\tfriendship. And this highlights the very rare -- and very special -- qualities \\r\\n\\t\\tof Senator McCain that I came to deeply admire. He didn\\'t judge \\r\\n\\t\\tindividuals based on the color of their skin, their gender, their \\r\\n\\t\\tbackgrounds, their political affiliations, or their bank\\r\\n\\t\\taccounts. He evaluated them on the merits of their character and the \\r\\n\\t\\tcontents of their hearts.1He judged them on the work they put in and the \\r\\n\\t\\tprinciples they lived by. It was this approach to humanity that made \\r\\n\\t\\tSenator John McCain so respected by countless people around the world, including me. \\r\\n\\t\\tHis accomplishments were many: US Senator, presidential \\r\\n\\t\\tcandidate, statesman, warrior, and hero. His work ethic -- tireless. His fight \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tlegendary. But what made Senator McCain so special was that he cared \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the substance of my heart -- more so than where I came from. While \\r\\n\\t\\tsome might find our friendship out of the ordinary, it was a perfect \\r\\n\\t\\texample of what made him an iconic figure of American politics, and service \\r\\n\\t\\tto fellow man. He celebrated differences. He embraced humanity; championed \\r\\n\\t\\twhat was true and just; and saw people for who they were. Yes, ours was an \\r\\n\\t\\tunlikely friendship but it\\'s one that I will always cherish. I\\'ve had the \\r\\n\\t\\thonor of attending several of theSedona Forumshosted by Senator McCain \\r\\n\\t\\tand his remarkable wife,Cindy. There were world leaders in politics, \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness, science, and education to discuss the most pressing matters of \\r\\n\\t\\tour time -- issues like health care, global warming, technology, and human \\r\\n\\t\\ttrafficking. These leaders gathered to find real solutions. And they \\r\\n\\t\\tgathered because Senator McCain asked them to be there. His devotion to \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking Arizona, the United States, and the whole world a better place for \\r\\n\\t\\teveryone has inspired countless leaders like those at the Sedona Forums. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92m confident his legacy of devotion, and to the common good, will \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to inspire people around the world long after today. A few years \\r\\n\\t\\tago, he was kind enough to take me on a personal tour of the U.S. Senate. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt \\r\\n\\t\\twas obvious that Senator McCain was highly regarded. He believed to be \\r\\n\\t\\tright and was good regardless of which political side of the aisle \\r\\n\\t\\this opinion fell on. I saw how respected he was and how much admiration he \\r\\n\\t\\tcommanded from people from across the political spectrum. But that \\r\\n\\t\\tadmiration wasn\\'t surprising because Senator McCain was known as a man \\r\\n\\t\\tof integrity and conviction, a man who at times -- just as he sacrificed \\r\\n\\t\\thimself for his fellow POWs in Vietnam -- willingly chose to sacrifice his \\r\\n\\t\\town political gains in order to accomplish what he believed was best for \\r\\n\\t\\tall. As -- As a result of this type of... sacrifice he may have lost the \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport of a political ally here and there, but he gained the respect and \\r\\n\\t\\tadmiration of an entire nation. In closing, I\\'d like to honor the love I saw \\r\\n\\t\\tin Senator McCain. He loved the people of Arizona, serving them passionately \\r\\n\\t\\tand diligently for decades. He took that same love to Washington and \\r\\n\\t\\tboldly advocated for the\\r\\n\\t\\tfreedoms and liberties he had grown to love as a young Navy pilot. But \\r\\n\\t\\tthe love I saw most was the love he had for his wife, Cindy, and his \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren. I heard him speak about them often, and the love always came \\r\\n\\t\\tpouring through in every word. Senator McCain: \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s been a true honor to \\r\\n\\t\\tcall you friend. Your toughness and bravery inspired us. Your sacrificed \\r\\n\\t\\t[sic] enriched our lives. Your devotion to the people of Arizona, our nation \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tand your convictions -- won our admiration. Your love set an example for all \\r\\n\\t\\tof us to follow. Jackie Robinson once said that \\r\\n\\t\\t\"life is not important \\r\\n\\t\\texcept in the impact that it has on other lives.\"2 Senator McCain: \\r\\n\\t\\tWe will miss the blessings of being in your presence. But \\r\\n\\t\\twe will never forget the impact you had on the world, and, more \\r\\n\\t\\timportantly, on each of the lives that you touched. We are all better for \\r\\n\\t\\thaving known you. Rest in peace, my friend.',\n",
       " 'Not every American understands the absolutely \\r\\n\\t\\tvital role that Germany and its honorable Chancellor,Chancellor Merkel, \\r\\n\\t\\tare playing in defense of the idea and the conscience of the West. But \\r\\n\\t\\tall of us who do, let me say thank you. My friends: In the four day -- four decades I have attendedthis \\r\\n\\t\\tconference, I cannot recall a year where its purpose was more necessary \\r\\n\\t\\tor more important. The -- This next panel is going to ask us to consider whether the West \\r\\n\\t\\twill survive. In recent years, this question would invite accusations of \\r\\n\\t\\thyperbole and alarmism. Not this year. If ever there was a time to treat \\r\\n\\t\\tthis question with a deadly seriousness, it is now. This question was real half a century ago [for]Ewald von Kleistand the \\r\\n\\t\\tfounders of this conference. Indeed, it\\x92s why they first started coming \\r\\n\\t\\tto Munich. They did not assume the West\\xa0would\\xa0survive because they had \\r\\n\\t\\tseen its near annihilation. They saw open markets give way to \\r\\n\\t\\tbeggar-thy-neighbor protectionism, and the poverty that imposed. They \\r\\n\\t\\tsaw a world order fracture into clashing ethnic and nationalist \\r\\n\\t\\tpassions, and the...misery that brought. They saw the rise of \\r\\n\\t\\thostile great powers, and the failure of deterrence, and the wars that \\r\\n\\t\\tfollowed. From the ashes of the most awful calamity in human history was born what \\r\\n\\t\\twe call the\\xa0West -- a\\xa0new and different and better kind of world order, \\r\\n\\t\\tone based not on blood-and-soil nationalism,\\xa0or spheres of influence, or \\r\\n\\t\\tconquest of the weak by the strong, but rather on\\xa0universal values, rule \\r\\n\\t\\tof law, open commerce, and\\xa0respect for the national sovereignty and \\r\\n\\t\\tindependence. Indeed, the entire idea of the West is that it is open to \\r\\n\\t\\tany person or any nation that honors and upholds these values. The unprecedented period of security and prosperity that we have enjoyed \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the past seven decades didn\\x92t happen by accident. It happened not \\r\\n\\t\\tonly because of the appeal of our values, but because we backed them up \\r\\n\\t\\twith our power and persevered in their defense.\\xa0Our predecessors did not \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve in the end of history, or that it bends inevitably towards \\r\\n\\t\\tjustice. That\\x92s up to us. That requires our persistent, painstaking \\r\\n\\t\\teffort, and that\\x92s why we come to Munich year after year after year. What would von Kleist\\x92s generation say if they saw our world today? I \\r\\n\\t\\tfear that much about it would be all-too-familiar for them, and they \\r\\n\\t\\twould be alarmed by it. They would be alarmed by\\xa0an increasing turn away from universal values \\r\\n\\t\\tand toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism. They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see towards \\r\\n\\t\\timmigrants and refugees and minority groups, especially Muslims. They would be alarmed by the growing inability, and even unwillingness, \\r\\n\\t\\tto separate truth from lies. They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe\\xa0flirting with\\xa0authoritarianism and\\xa0romanticizing it as our moral \\r\\n\\t\\tequivalent. But what would alarm them most, I think, is a sense that many of our \\r\\n\\t\\tpeoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West; that \\r\\n\\t\\tthey see it as a bad deal that we may be better off without; and\\xa0that \\r\\n\\t\\twhile Western nations still have the power to maintain our world order, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s unclear whether we have the will. All of us must accept our share of blame for this turn of events. We \\r\\n\\t\\tgrew complacent. We made mistakes. At times we tried to do too much, and \\r\\n\\t\\tat others we failed to do enough. We lost touch with many of our people. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92ve been too slow to recognize and respond to their hardships.\\xa0We need \\r\\n\\t\\tto face up to these realities, but this does not mean losing hope and \\r\\n\\t\\tretreating. That we must not do. I know -- I know there is profound concern across Europe and the world \\r\\n\\t\\tthat America is laying down the mantle of global leadership. I can only \\r\\n\\t\\tspeak for myself, but I do not believe that\\xa0that is the message you will \\r\\n\\t\\thear from all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to \\r\\n\\t\\tMunich this weekend. That\\x92s the not -- not the message you heard todayfrom Secretary of \\r\\n\\t\\tDefense Jim Mattis. That\\x92s not the message you will hear todayfrom Vice President Mike \\r\\n\\t\\tPence. That\\x92s not the message you will hear from Secretary of Homeland Security \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn Kelly.1 And that is certainly not the message you will hear tomorrow from our \\r\\n\\t\\tbipartisan congressional delegation. Make no mistake, my friends: These are dangerous times, but you should \\r\\n\\t\\tnot count America out, and we should not -- and we should not count each \\r\\n\\t\\tother out.\\xa0We must be prudent but we cannot wring our hands and wallow \\r\\n\\t\\tin self-doubt. We must appreciate the limits of our power, but we cannot \\r\\n\\t\\tallow ourselves to question the rightness and goodness of the West. We \\r\\n\\t\\tmust understand and learn from our mistakes, but we cannot be paralyzed \\r\\n\\t\\tby fear. We cannot give up on ourselves and on each other. That is the \\r\\n\\t\\tdefinition of decadence. And that\\x92s how world orders really do decline \\r\\n\\t\\tand fail. This is exactly what our adversaries want. This is their goal. They have \\r\\n\\t\\tno meaningful allies, so they seek to sow dissent among us and divide us \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom each other. They know that their power and influence are inferior \\r\\n\\t\\tto ours, so they seek to subvert us, and erode our resolve to resist, \\r\\n\\t\\tand terrorize us into passivity. They know they have little to offer the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld beyond selfishness and fear, so they seek to undermine our \\r\\n\\t\\tconfidence in ourselves and our belief in our own values. We must take our own side in this fight. We must be vigilant. We must \\r\\n\\t\\tpersevere. And through all -- it all, we must never, never cease to \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve in the moral superiority of our own values: that we stand for \\r\\n\\t\\ttruth against falsehood, freedom against tyranny, right against \\r\\n\\t\\tinjustice, hope against despair -- and that even though we will \\r\\n\\t\\tinevitably take losses and suffer setbacks, through it all, as long as \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople of goodwill and courage refuse to lose faith in the West, it will \\r\\n\\t\\tendure. That\\x92s why we come to Munich. That\\x92s why we come to Munich, year in and year out -- to revitalize our \\r\\n\\t\\tcommon moral purpose, our belief that our values are worth the fighting \\r\\n\\t\\tfor. Because in the final analysis, the survival of the West is not just \\r\\n\\t\\ta material struggle; it is now, and it\\x92s always been a moral struggle. \\r\\n\\t\\tNow more than ever we must not forget this. During one of the darkest days of the early Cold War, the great American \\r\\n\\t\\tnovelist, William Faulkner,delivered a short speechin -- in Stockholm \\r\\n\\t\\tupon receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature. \\x93I decline to accept the \\r\\n\\t\\tend of man,\\x94 Faulkner said. Even now, when the temptation to despair is greatest, I refuse to accept \\r\\n\\t\\tthe end of the West. I refuse to accept the demise of our world order. I refuse to accept that our greatest triumphs cannot once again spring \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom our moments of greatest peril, as they have so many times before. I refuse to accept that our values are morally equivalent to those of \\r\\n\\t\\tour adversaries.2 I am a proud, unapologetic believer in the West. I believe we must always, always stand up for it. For if we do not, who will? Thank you.',\n",
       " \"My fellow citizens: I have requested this opportunity to talk to the people of\\r\\nMassachusetts about the tragedy which happened last Friday evening. This morning I entered\\r\\na plea of guilty to the charge of leaving the scene of an accident. Prior to my appearance\\r\\nin court it would have been [im]proper for me to comment on these matters. But tonight I am\\r\\nfree to tell you what happened and to say what it means to me. On the weekend of July 18th, I was onMartha's Vineyard Islandparticipating with my nephew, Joe Kennedy -- as for thirty years my family has\\r\\nparticipated -- in the annualEdgartown Sailing Regatta. Only reasons of health prevented\\r\\nmy wife from accompanying me. On Chappaquiddick Island, off Martha's Vineyard, I attended, on\\r\\nFriday evening, July 18th, a cook-out I had encouraged and helped sponsor for a devoted group\\r\\nof Kennedy campaign secretaries. When I left the party, around 11:15pm, I was\\r\\naccompanied by one of these girls, MissMary Jo Kopechne. Mary Jo was one of the most\\r\\ndevoted members of the staff of Senator Robert Kennedy. She worked for him for four years\\r\\nand was broken up over his death. For this reason, and because she was such a gentle,\\r\\nkind, and idealistic person, all of us tried to help her feel that she still had a home\\r\\nwith the Kennedy family. Mary Jo \\r\\nKopechne There is no truth, no truth whatever, to the widely circulated\\r\\nsuspicions of immoral conduct that have been leveled at my behavior and hers regarding\\r\\nthat evening. There has never been a private relationship between us of any kind. I know\\r\\nof nothing in Mary Jo's conduct on that or any other occasion -- and the same is true of the\\r\\nother girls at that party -- that would lend any substance to such ugly speculation about\\r\\ntheir character. Nor was I driving under the influence of liquor. Little over one mile away, the car that I was driving on \\r\\nan unlit\\r\\nroad went off a narrow bridge which had no guard rails and was built on a left angle to the\\r\\nroad. The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water. I remember\\r\\nthinking as the cold water rushed in around my head that I was for certain drowning. Then\\r\\nwater entered my lungs and I actual felt the sensation of drowning. But somehow I\\r\\nstruggled to the surface alive. I made immediate and repeated efforts to save Mary Jo by diving into\\r\\nthe strong and murky current, but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion\\r\\nand alarm. My conduct and conversations during the next several hours, to the extent that\\r\\nI can remember them, make no sense to me at all. Although my doctors informed me that I suffered a cerebral\\r\\nconcussion, as well as shock, I do not seek to escape responsibility for my actions by\\r\\nplacing the blame either on the physical and emotional trauma brought on by the accident, or\\r\\non anyone else. I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to\\r\\nthe police immediately. Instead of looking directly for a telephone after lying exhausted in\\r\\nthe grass for an undetermined time, I walked back to the cottage where the party was being\\r\\nheld and requested the help of two friends, my cousin, Joseph Gargan and Phil Markham, and\\r\\ndirected them to return immediately to the scene with me -- this was sometime after\\r\\nmidnight -- in order to undertake a new effort to dive down and locate Miss Kopechne.\\r\\nTheir strenuous efforts, undertaken at some risk to their own lives, also proved futile. All kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some of\\r\\nthem irrational, many of them which I cannot recall, and some of which I would not have\\r\\nseriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during this\\r\\nperiod. They were reflected in the various inexplicable, inconsistent, and inconclusive\\r\\nthings I said and did, including such questions as whether the girl might still be alive\\r\\nsomewhere out of that immediate area, whether some awful curse did actually hang over all\\r\\nthe Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happened\\r\\nand to delay my report, whether somehow the awful weight of this incredible incident\\r\\nmight in some way pass from my shoulders. I was overcome, I'm frank to say, by a jumble\\r\\nof emotions: grief, fear, doubt, exhaustion, panic, confusion, and shock. Instructing Gargan and Markham not to alarm Mary Jo's friends that\\r\\nnight, I had them take me to the ferry crossing. The ferry having shut down for the night,\\r\\nI suddenly jumped into the water and impulsively swam across, nearly drowning once again\\r\\nin the effort, and returned to my hotel about 2:00am -- and collapsed in my room. I remember going out at one point and saying something to the room\\r\\nclerk. In the morning, with my mind somewhat more lucid, I made an effort\\r\\nto call a family legal advisor, Burke Marshall, from a public telephone on the\\r\\nChappaquiddick side of the ferry and then belatedly reported the accident to the Martha['s]\\r\\nVineyard police. Today, as I mentioned, I felt morally obligated to plead guilty to\\r\\nthe charge of leaving the scene of an accident. No words on my part can possibly express\\r\\nthe terrible pain and suffering I feel over this tragic incident. This last week has been\\r\\nan agonizing one for me and for the members of my family. And the grief we feel over the loss\\r\\nof a wonderful friend will remain with us the rest of our lives. These events, the publicity, innuendo, and whispers which have\\r\\nsurrounded them and my admission of guilt this morning raises the question in my mind of\\r\\nwhether my standing among the people of my State has been so impaired that I should resign\\r\\nmy seat in the United States Senate. If at any time the citizens of Massachusetts should\\r\\nlack confidence in their Senator's character, or his ability -- with or without\\r\\njustification -- he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duties and should not\\r\\ncontinue in office. The people of this State, the State which sent John Quincy Adams,\\r\\nand Daniel Webster, and Charles Sumner, and Henry Cabot Lodge, and John Kennedy to the\\r\\nUnited States Senate are entitled to representation in that body by men who inspire their\\r\\nutmost confidence. For this reason, I would understand full well why some might think it\\r\\nright for me to resign. For me, this will be a difficult decision to make. It has been seven years since my first election to the Senate. You\\r\\nand I share many memories -- some of them have been glorious, some have been very sad. The\\r\\nopportunity to work with you and serve Massachusetts has made my life worthwhile. And so I ask you tonight, the people of Massachusetts, to think this\\r\\nthrough with me. In facing this decision, I seek your advice and opinion. In making it, I\\r\\nseek your prayers -- for this is a decision that I will have finally to make on my own. It has been written: I pray that I can have the courage to make the right decision.\\r\\nWhatever is decided, whatever the future holds for me, I hope that I shall have \\r\\n-- be\\r\\nable to put this most recent tragedy behind me and make some further contribution to our\\r\\nstate and mankind -- whether it be in public or private life. Thank you and good night.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land: Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you. My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union -- not the state of our government, but of our American community; and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect union. The state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years. We have created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles. America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970s. And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country. Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace. And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And as they go down, prospects for America's future go up. We live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global competition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families. We must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future? And, third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America? We know big government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a program for every problem. We have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means. The era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both. I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world. To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together. Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end. I compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget. And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years. Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction. Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget. Though differences remain among us which are significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut. These cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or education, or the environment, or by raising taxes on working families. I have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good ideas that we could all embrace. We ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to resolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future. We should do that now, and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy. Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But America was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts. Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people. Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger America. Before I go on, I would like to take just a moment to thank my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children -- a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary. All strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children. I have heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as parents, but all of us in our other roles -- our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments -- all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given capacities. To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy. I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now. To make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done -- to identify your programming in ways that help parents to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television. I am ready to work with you. I say to those who make and market cigarettes: every year a million children take up smoking, even though it is against the law. Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result. Our Administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children. I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children. I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children. I will sign it immediately. Let us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help. Every one of us should join them. That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people. To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are, that it has dropped for two years in a row. But we all know it is still far too high. Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grass-roots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts. I call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay together. For families who stay together not only do better economically, their children do better as well. In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children. If your family has separated, you must pay your child support. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you -- only you can make the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability. Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we will all need for this new century. In our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway, with computers and good software, and well-trained teachers. We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds. Every diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every school and every state to adopt national standards of excellence; to measure whether schools are meeting those standards; to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grass-roots reform; and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about. I challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend; and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. I challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good values and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms. I challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn off the TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's classroom. No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you. My fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever before. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate. That's something we should all be proud of, because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago. Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors. These initiatives are right for America and we should keep them going. And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000; to provide a $1000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of graduates in every high school in the United States; to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America. Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising children. They need retirement security. They need access to health care. More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime. So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training. This is a G.I. Bill for America's workers we should all be able to agree on. More and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a living wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage. In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty, and to encourage people to move from welfare to work. This expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people. We should not do that. I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children. That's one of the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement. I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans. That is something we should all agree on. We should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers's pension funds. I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the treasury. But I believe it is false economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again. Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the past two years, over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that. And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid -- not just to the poor, but to people in working families, including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, and senior citizens in nursing homes. In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid. America cannot become stronger if they become weaker. The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid -- these things, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 -- these things will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives. But employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing in so many of our finest companies -- working together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and so does America. Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, is clearly working. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In New York City murders are down 25 percent; in St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear. The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down. Community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models and heroes. Don't let them down. The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books. Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults. And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs should be one strike and you're out. I challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. More police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but developed in communities. I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots prevention efforts. Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem. The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes. Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America. For the last two years, one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort. Tonight I am nominating him -- a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command -- General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar. General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has a role to play on this team. Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more time. Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that endangers our health. And in too many communities, the water is not safe to drink. We still have much to do. Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them. This issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to believe some basic things. Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment? I do. Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can. That should be our commitment. We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do it. To businesses this Administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it -- as long as you do it right. To communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe. Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security. We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service, and so do the American people. All over the world, even after the Cold War, people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as the Cold War fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong. The threats we face today as Americans respect no nation's borders. Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation. If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows. Of course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything. But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist. We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's very best peacemaker. By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children. North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for America -- over 80 of them -- we have opened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs. We stood with those taking risks for peace: In Northern Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must never return. In the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources, and even dreams. And we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now, our troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold. As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing, but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out. Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American people. But make no mistake about it:important challenges remain. The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it -- now. We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty -- this year. As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention -- this year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing -- now. We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace. My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight: to reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them. Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it. Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we can limit spending and open the airwaves to all candidates. I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the American people. Our Administration is working hard to give the American people a government that works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decision-making out of Washington, back to states and local communities. As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy, but with more opportunities. Through our successful Empowerment Zones and Community Development Banks, we are helping people to find jobs, to start businesses. And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need them. But there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this Administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws. I want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal government. Today our federal government is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President. Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't know that. And there is a good reason: The remaining federal work force is composed of Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before, to make sure the quality of our services does not decline. I'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49 year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism. But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again. On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States -- to honor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years; to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word. I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, and even more from America. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge. I say again, the era of big government is over. But we can't go back to the era of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us -- the division, the discrimination, the rancor -- we have to reach across it to find common ground. We have got to work together if we want America to work. I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy. She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community. Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer -- not because they are star athletes, but because they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges. They are our real champions. Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives. None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny together -- one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another. There have always been things we could do together -- dreams we could make real -- which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have forged our identity, our very union, from every point of view and every point on the planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us -- by our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common ground. America has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here? Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans? Our country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best is yet to come, if we all do our part. Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\",\n",
       " \"After this reception, I think you all are ready for the rest of this convention, which has already been so positive and good. I know and you know that Chicago is my kind of town. And Chicago is my kind of village. I have so many friends here, people who have been important to me all my life. And it seems like every single one of them has given me advice on this speech. One friend suggested that I appear here tonight withBinti, the child saving gorilla from theBrookfield Zoo. You know, as this friend explained, Binti is a typical Chicagoan, tough on the outside but with a heart of gold underneath. Another friend advised me that I should cut my hair and color it orange and then change my name to HillaryRodmanClinton. But, after considering these and countless other suggestions, I decided to do tonight what I've been doing for more than 25 years. I want to talk about what matters most in our lives and in our nation, children and families. I wish we could be sitting around a kitchen table, just us, talking about our hopes and fears about our children's futures. For Bill and me, family has been the center of our lives. But we also know that our family like your family is part of a larger community that can help or hurt our best efforts to raise our child. Right now in our biggest cities and our smallest towns there are boys and girls being tucked gently into bed, and there are boys and girls who have no one to call mom or dad and no place to call home. Right now there are mothers and fathers just finishing a long days work and there are mothers and fathers just going to work, some to their second or third jobs of day. Right now there are parents worrying, what if the babysitter is sick tomorrow or how can we pay for college this fall. And right now there are parents despairing about gang members and drug pushers on the corners in their neighborhoods. Right now there are parents questioning a popular culture that glamorizes sex and violence, smoking and drinking and teaches children that the logos on their clothes are more valued than the generosity in their hearts. But also, right now, there are dedicated teachers preparing their lessons for the new school year. There are volunteers tutoring and coaching children. There are doctors and nurses caring for sick children, police officers working to help kids stay out of trouble and off drugs. Of course, parents first and foremost are responsible for their children. But we are all responsible for ensuring that children are raised in a nation that doesn't just talk about family values, but acts in ways that values families. Just think -- asChristopher Reeve so eloquently reminded us last night, we are all part of one family, the American family, and each one of us has value. Each child who comes into this world should feel special -- every body and every girl. Our daughter Chelsea will graduate from college in 2001 at the dawn of the next century. Though that's not so far away, it is hard for any of us to know what the world will look like then, much less when Chelsea is my age in the year 2028. But one thing we know for sure is that change is certain. Progress is not. Progress depends on the choices we make today for tomorrow and on whether we meet our challenges and protect our values. We can start by doing more to support parents and the job they have to do. Issues affecting children and families are some of the hardest we face as parents, as citizens, as a nation. In October, Bill and I will celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. Bill was with me when Chelsea was born in the delivery room, in my hospital room and when we brought our baby daughter home. Not only did I have lots of help, I was able to stay in the hospital as long as my doctor thought I needed to be there. But today, too many new mothers are asked to get up and get out after 24 hours, and that is just not enough time for many new mothers and babies. That's why the President is right to support a bill that would prohibit the practice of forcing mothers and babies to leave the hospital in less than 48 hours. That's also why more hospitals ought to install 24-hour hotlines to answer questions once new mothers and fathers get home. That's why home nurses can make such a difference to parents who may not have grandparents or aunts and uncles around to help. We have to do whatever it takes to help parents meet their responsibilities at home and at work. The very first piece of legislation that my husband signed into law had been vetoed twice -- the Family and Medical Leave Law. That law allows parents time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for family emergencies without fear of losing their jobs. Already it has helped 12 million families, and it hasn't hurt the economy one bit. You know, Bill and I are fortunate that our jobs have allowed us to take breaks from work, not only when Chelsea was born, but to attend her school events and take her to the doctor. But millions of other parents can't get time off. That's why my husband wants to expand theFamily and Medical Leave Lawso that parents can take time off for children's doctors appointments and parent-teacher conferences at school. We all know that raising kids is a full-time job, and since most parents work, they are, -- we are -- stretched thin. Just think about what many parents are responsible for on any given day -- packing lunches; dropping the kids off at school; going to work; checking to make sure that the kids get home from school safely; shopping for groceries; making dinner; doing the laundry; helping with homework; paying the bills. And I didn't even mention taking the dog to the vet. That's why my husband wants to pass a flex-time law that will give parents the option to take overtime pay either in extra income or in extra time off, depending upon which is ever best for your family. Our family has been lucky to have been blessed with a child with good health. Chelsea has spent only one night in the hospital after she had her tonsils out. But Bill and I couldn't sleep at all that night. But our experience was nothing like the emotional strain on parents when their children are seriously ill. They often worry about where they will get the money to pay the medical bills. That is why my husband has always felt that all American families should have affordable health insurance. Just last week the President signed a bill sponsored by Senators Kennedy andKassebaum, a Democrat and a Republican that will enable 25 million Americans to keep their health insurance even when they switch jobs or lose a job or a have a family member who's been sick. This bill contains some of the key provisions from the President's proposal for health care reform. It was an important step achieved only after both parties agreed to build, not block progress on making health care available to all Americans. Now the country must take the next step of helping unemployed Americans and their children keep health insurance for six months after losing their jobs. If you loose your job it's bad enough. But your daughter shouldn't have to loose her doctor too. And our nation still must find a way to offer affordable health care coverage to the working poor and the ten million children who lack health insurance today. The President also hasn't forgotten that there are thousands of children languishing in foster care who can't be returned home. That's why he signed legislation last week that provides for a 5,000 dollar tax credit for parents who adopt a child. It also abolishes the barriers to cross-racial adoptions. Never again will a racial barrier stand in the way of a family's love. My husband also understands that parents are their child's first teachers. Not only do we need to read to our children and talk to them in way that encourage learning, we must support our teachers and our schools in deeds as well as words. The President announced today an important initiative, called America Reads. This initiative is aimed at making sure all children can read well by the third grade. It will require volunteers, but I know there are thousands and thousands of Americans will volunteer to help every child read well. For Bill and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding and more humbling than raising our daughter. And we have learned that to raise a happy, healthy, and hopeful child, it takes a family. It takes teachers. It takes clergy. It takes business people. It takes community leaders. It takes those who protect our health and safety. It takes all of us. Yes,it takes a village. And it takes a President. It takes a President who believes not only in the potential of his own child, but of all children, who believes not only in the strength of his own family, but of the American family who believes not only in the promise of each of us as individuals, but in our promise together as a nation. It takes a President who not only holds these beliefs, but acts on them. It takes Bill Clinton. Sometimes late at night, when I see Chelsea doing her homework or watching TV or talking to a friend on the phone, I think to myself her life and the lives of millions of boys and girls will be better because of what all of us are doing together. They will face fewer obstacles and more possibilities. That is something we should all be proud of. And that is what this election is all about. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " 'President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Governor \\r\\nKeating, Mrs. Keating, Mayor Nordick, and our visiting Governor from the great \\r\\nstate of Texas, Governor and Mrs. Bush, and so many people that have come here \\r\\nfrom all over the country to join in this prayer service. And for all that has been said, I don\\'t know \\r\\nwhat I\\'m going to say because we\\'ve had several messages brought here. One from \\r\\nthe President, which could be a sermon from a pulpit anywhere -- and maybe \\r\\nthat\\'s what he\\'ll do someday, 10 or 20 years from now. But most important of \\r\\nall, all of those people that have been named from the Fire Department, the \\r\\nPolice Department -- those people that went in the building, those people that \\r\\nhave lost loved ones, those that have been injured in the bombing, our tears \\r\\nmingle with yours as we walked through the room a moment ago and shook hands \\r\\nwith so many of you and had a little prayer with several of you. And you\\'re from the various agencies, like the \\r\\nfire, the medical, the police, the hundreds of volunteers who we\\'ve already \\r\\nheard about -- no matter how hard we try, words simply cannot express the horror \\r\\nand the shock and the revulsion we all feel over\\r\\nwhat took place in this city last Wednesday. That terrible and senseless \\r\\ntragedy runs against the grain of every standard, every belief, and every custom \\r\\nwe hold as a civilized society in the United States. And the images of \\r\\ndevastation and human suffering we have seen here will be indelibly imprinted on \\r\\neach one of our minds and hearts as long as we live. That blast was like a \\r\\nviolent explosion ripping at the very heart of America. And long after the \\r\\nrubble is cleared and the rebuilding begins, the scars of this senseless and \\r\\nevil outrage will remain. But we come together here today not only to \\r\\npray and forgive and love, but to say to those who masterminded this cruel plot, \\r\\nand to those who carried it out, that the spirit of this city and this nation \\r\\nwill not be defeated. Someday the wounds will heal and someday those \\r\\nwho thought they could sew chaos and discord will be brought to justice, as \\r\\nPresident Clinton has so eloquently promised. The wounds of this tragedy are \\r\\ndeep. But the courage and faith and determination of the people of Oklahoma City \\r\\nare even deeper. A part -- A part of my family lives in \\r\\nOklahoma. My father had a brother, an older brother, a giant of a man, and he \\r\\ncame to Oklahoma and he founded a business in Tahlequah, in Muskogee. I came to \\r\\nOklahoma City and held two or three crusades. The first one was here in these \\r\\nfairgrounds many, many years ago. Some of you might have been little children at \\r\\nthat time. But I\\'ve known something of the strength and \\r\\nthe courage and the character of people that live in Oklahoma. And the Bible \\r\\nsays -- the Bible says in Psalm 147:3: He heals the broken-hearted; he binds up \\r\\nthe wounds.And so with this service today, \\r\\nwe stand together to say: \"Let the healing begin!\" But since I have been here, I have been asked \\r\\nthe question several times, many times, \"Why does God allow it?\" Why does a God \\r\\nof love and mercy that we read about and hear about allow such a terrible thing \\r\\nto happen? Over 3000 years ago, there was named Job -- struggled with the same \\r\\nquestion. He asked \"why\" because he was a good man. And yet, disaster struck him \\r\\nsuddenly and swiftly. He lost seven sons, three daughters. He lost all his \\r\\npossessions. He even lost his health. Even his wife and his friends turned \\r\\nagainst him. His wife said, \"Curse God and die!\"¹And in the midst of his suffering he asked this question, \"Why?\" Job didn\\'t \\r\\nknow. \"Why did I not perish at birth?\" he cried. Perhaps this is the way you feel. And I want to \\r\\nassure you that God understands those feelings. The Bible says in Isaiah 43:2: When \\r\\nyou pass through the waters I will be with you; and when you walk through the \\r\\nfire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you ablaze. And \\r\\nyet, Job found there were lessons to be learned from his suffering, even if he \\r\\ndidn\\'t fully understand it. And that is true for all of us as well. What \\r\\nare some of the lessons that we can learn from what has happened? First, there\\'s \\r\\na mystery to it. I\\'ve been asked why God allows it. I don\\'t know. I can\\'t give a \\r\\ndirect answer. I have to confess that I never fully understand -- even for my \\r\\nown satisfaction. I have to accept by faith that God is a God of love and mercy \\r\\nand compassion -- even in the midst of suffering. I can remember many years ago \\r\\nlying a dirt floor in a field hospital in Korea and looking up into the face of \\r\\na soldier, suspended in a frame, who was horribly wounded. And the doctor said \\r\\nhe\\'ll never walk again. And I asked myself, \"Why?\" I can recall standing at the \\r\\nbedside of children who were dying, and I\\'ve asked myself, \"Lord, why?\" I recall walking through the devastation left \\r\\nby hurricanes in Florida and South Carolina, and typhoons in India, and \\r\\nearthquakes in Guatemala and California, and I\\'ve asked myself, \"Why?\" The Bible \\r\\nsays God is not the author of evil. And it speaks of evil in 1 Thessalonians as \\r\\na mystery. There\\'s something about evil we will never fully understand this side \\r\\nof eternity. But the Bible says two other things that we \\r\\nsometimes are tempted to forget. It tells us that there is a devil, that Satan is \\r\\nvery real and he has great power. It also tells us that evil is real and that \\r\\nthe human heart is capable of almost limitless evil when it is cut off from God \\r\\nand from the moral law. The prophet Jeremiah said, \"The \\r\\nheart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?\"² That\\'s your heart and my heart without God. And that\\'s one reason we each \\r\\nneed God in our lives. For only He can change our hearts and give us the desire \\r\\nand the power to do what is right and keep us from doing wrong. Times like this will do one of two things: It \\r\\nwill either make us hard and bitter and angry at God, or they will make us \\r\\ntender and open and help us to reach out in faith. And I think that\\'s what the \\r\\npeople of Oklahoma are doing that I\\'ve met since I\\'ve been here these past few \\r\\ndays. I pray that you will not let bitterness and poison creep into your soul, \\r\\nbut that you will turn in faith and trust in God, even if we cannot understand. \\r\\nIt is better to face something like this with God than without him. But the lesson of this event has not only been \\r\\nabout mystery, but we\\'ve already heard it\\'s a lesson of a community coming \\r\\ntogether. What an -- What an example: Oklahoma City and the people of Oklahoma \\r\\nhave given to the world, because the television has been carrying it as much as \\r\\nany event I can ever remember like this. And the cooperation between officials \\r\\nof every level of government and the community, no matter what religious group \\r\\nwe belong to and what political views we may have. None of us will ever forget some of those \\r\\npictures on television that have already been mentioned here today; or the \\r\\npicture of people standing in line to give blood; the work of the Red Cross, the \\r\\nSalvation Army, and a host of other humanitarian organizations, as well as the \\r\\nemergency workers. And the doctors and nurses have inspired us and humbled us. A tragedy like this could have torn this city \\r\\napart, but instead it has united you in a way that you\\'ve never been united \\r\\nbefore. Hundreds, if not thousands, of prayer groups around the world have been \\r\\npraying for you. And I\\'m sure -- as I\\'ve been told -- that you sense their \\r\\nprayers and their support. The forces of hate and violence must not be allowed \\r\\nto gain their victory -- not just in our society, but in our hearts. Nor must \\r\\nrespond to hate with more hate. This is a time of coming together and we\\'ve seen \\r\\nthat already. This tragedy also gives us a lesson in comfort \\r\\nand compassion. We\\'ve seen an outpouring of sympathy and help, not only in \\r\\nOklahoma City and Oklahoma, but throughout the United States and throughout the \\r\\nworld. We\\'ve been reminded that a cruel event like this which so vividly \\r\\ndemonstrates the depths of human evil also brings out the best of us, brings out \\r\\nthe best of the human spirit -- the human compassion and sympathy and sacrifice. \\r\\nBut this can also teach us about God\\'s comfort and compassion. Some of you today are going through heartache \\r\\nand grief so intense that you wonder if it will ever go away. I\\'ve had the \\r\\nprivilege of meeting some of you and talking to you. But I want to tell you that \\r\\nour God cares for you and for your family and for your city. The Bible says that \\r\\nthe God of all comfort who comforts us in our troubles. Jesus said, \"Blessed are \\r\\nthey that mourn for they shall be comforted.\" I pray that every one of you will \\r\\nexperience God\\'s comfort during these days as you turn to him, for God loves you \\r\\nand He shares in your suffering. Difficult as it may be for you to see right \\r\\nnow, this event gives us, as we\\'ve heard from the Archbishop, a message of hope. \\r\\nYes, there is hope. There\\'s hope for the present because I believe the stage is \\r\\nalready been set for the restoration and renewal of the spirit of this city. \\r\\nYou\\'re a city that will always survive, and you\\'ll never give up. Today, it\\'s my \\r\\nprayer that all Americans will rededicate ourselves to a new spirit of \\r\\nbrotherhood and compassion, working together to solve the problems and barriers \\r\\nthat would tear us apart. But there\\'s also hope for the future because of \\r\\nGod\\'s promises. As a Christian, I have hope not just for this life but for the \\r\\nlife to come. Someday, there will be a glorious reunion with those who have died \\r\\nand gone to heaven before us. And that includes all those innocent children that \\r\\nare lost. They\\'re not lost from God because any child that young is \\r\\nautomatically in heaven and in God\\'s arms. But this -- this event also reminds us of the \\r\\nbrevity and uncertainty of life. It reminds us that we never know when we\\'re \\r\\ngoing to be taken. I doubt if even one of those who went to that building to \\r\\nwork, or to go to the children\\'s place, ever dreamed that that was their last \\r\\nday on earth. That is why we each need to face our own spiritual need and commit \\r\\nourselves to God. It\\'s ironic that this terrible event took place \\r\\njust three days after the churches of this city were filled with people \\r\\ncelebrating Easter. Just one week ago today. And throughout the world, the \\r\\nEastern Orthodox churches celebrate Easter on this day. And Easter always brings \\r\\nhope to all of us. For the Christian, the Cross tells us that God understands our \\r\\nsuffering, for He took upon Himself at the Cross all of our sins and all of our \\r\\nfailures and all of our sufferings. And our Lord on that Cross asked the \\r\\nquestion: \"Why?\" \"My God, my God why hast thou forsaken \\r\\nme?\"³And He received his answer. He knew: To redeem the world. To save \\r\\nyou and me from our sins. To give us assurance that if we died we\\'re going to \\r\\nheaven. He was saying from the Cross, \"I love you!\" And I know the heartaches \\r\\nand the sorrows and the pain that you feel. Easter points us beyond the tragedy of the \\r\\nCross to the hope of the empty tomb. It tells us that there\\'s hope for eternal \\r\\nlife, that Christ has conquered death. And it also tells us that God has \\r\\ntriumphed over evil and death and hell. This is our hope, and it can be your \\r\\nhope as well. I was deeply moved Friday night, while watching \\r\\nLarry King talk to Edye Smith, who lost her two little boys in that explosion. \\r\\nHer brother, a 28 year old police officer, was dispatched to the crime scene to \\r\\nhelp. And in searching the rubble, he found one of his nephews. The boy\\'s \\r\\ngrandfather is a Christian evangelist who said that conducting their funeral was \\r\\nthe hardest thing he ever faced, and that his faith had been crucial in helping \\r\\nhim through the tragedy. He quoted Romans 8:28: And we know that in all things \\r\\nGod works for the good of those who love Him-- \\r\\nand [the boy\\'s grandfather] said if that were the only verse he had in the whole \\r\\nBible, it would work through all of his problems, if we only believe it. President and Mrs. Kennedy -- Mrs. Clinton will \\r\\nremember at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington earlier this year \\r\\nAmbassador Andrew Young, who\\'d gone through the terrible agony of losing his \\r\\nbeloved wife whom he loved so much to cancer -- he closed his talk at your \\r\\nprayer breakfast with a quote from an old hymn: \"How firm our [a] foundation.\"\\r\\nThe 4th verse of that hymn says: \"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for \\r\\n\\t\\treposeI will not, I will not, desert to its [his] foes;That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,I\\'ll never, no never, no never, forsake!\"4 My prayer for you today is that you will feel \\r\\nthe loving arms of God wrapped around you and will know in your heart that he \\r\\nwill never forsake you, as you trust Him. God bless Oklahoma.',\n",
       " \"Good \\r\\n\\t\\tafternoon: Today, as of noon, almost half of the federal government \\r\\n\\t\\temployees are idle. The government is partially shutting down because \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress has failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare \\r\\n\\t\\tpremiums and deep cuts in education and the environment. It is particularly \\r\\n\\t\\tunfortunate that the Republican Congress has brought us to this juncture \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause, after all, we share a central goal -- balancing the federal \\r\\n\\t\\tbudget. We must lift the burden of debt that threatens the future of our \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren and grandchildren, and we must free-up money so that the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivate sector can invest, create jobs, and our economy can continue its \\r\\n\\t\\thealthy growth. Since I took office, we have \\r\\n\\t\\tcut the federal deficit nearly in half. It is important that the people \\r\\n\\t\\tof the United States know that the United States now has proportionately \\r\\n\\t\\tthe lowest government budget deficit of any large industrial nation. We \\r\\n\\t\\thave eliminated 200,000 positions from the federal bureaucracy since I \\r\\n\\t\\ttook office. Our federal government is now the smallest percentage of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe civilian work force it has been since 1933, before the New Deal. We \\r\\n\\t\\thave made enormous progress, and now we must finish the job. Let me be clear -- we must \\r\\n\\t\\tbalance the budget. I proposed to Congress a balanced budget, but \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress refused to enact it. Congress has even refused to give me the \\r\\n\\t\\tline-item veto to help me achieve further deficit reduction. But we must \\r\\n\\t\\tbalance this budget without resorting to their priorities, without their \\r\\n\\t\\tunwise cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, in education and the environment. Five months ago I proposed \\r\\n\\t\\tmy balanced budget plan. It balances the budget in the right way. It \\r\\n\\t\\tcuts hundreds of wasteful and outdated programs, but it upholds our \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental values -- to provide opportunity, to respect our obligations \\r\\n\\t\\tto our parents and our children, to strengthen families and to \\r\\n\\t\\tstrengthen America -- because it preserves Medicare and Medicaid, it \\r\\n\\t\\tinvests in education and technology, it protects the environment, and it \\r\\n\\t\\tgives the tax cuts to working families for child rearing and for \\r\\n\\t\\teducation. Unfortunately, Republican leaders in Washington have put \\r\\n\\t\\tideology ahead of common sense and shared values in their pursuit of a \\r\\n\\t\\tbudget plan. We can balance the budget \\r\\n\\t\\twithout doing what they seek to do. We can balance the budget without \\r\\n\\t\\tthe deep cuts in education, without the deep cuts in the environment, \\r\\n\\t\\twithout letting Medicare wither on the vine, without imposing tax \\r\\n\\t\\tincreases on the hardest-pressed working families in America. I am \\r\\n\\t\\tfighting for a balanced budget that is good for America and consistent \\r\\n\\t\\twith our values. If they'll give me the tools, I'll balance the budget. I vetoed the spending bill \\r\\n\\t\\tsent to me by Congress last night because America can never accept under \\r\\n\\t\\tpressure what it would not accept in free and open debate. I strongly \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve their budget plan is bad for America. I believe it will \\r\\n\\t\\tundermine opportunity, make it harder for families to do the work that \\r\\n\\t\\tthey have to do, weaken our obligations to our parents and our children, \\r\\n\\t\\tand make our country more divided. So I will continue to fight for the \\r\\n\\t\\tright kind of balanced budget. Remember, the Republicans \\r\\n\\t\\tare following a very explicit strategy announced last April by Speaker \\r\\n\\t\\tGingrich, to use the threat of a government shutdown to force America to \\r\\n\\t\\taccept their cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, to accept their cuts in \\r\\n\\t\\teducation and technology and the environment. Yesterday they sent me \\r\\n\\t\\tlegislation that said -- we will only keep the government going, and we \\r\\n\\t\\twill only let it pay its debts if and only if we accept their cuts in \\r\\n\\t\\tMedicare, their cuts in education, their cuts in the environment, and \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir repeal of 25 years of bipartisan commitments to protect the \\r\\n\\t\\tenvironment and public health. On behalf of the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople, I said no. If America has to close down access to education, to \\r\\n\\t\\ta clean environment, to affordable health care, to keep our government \\r\\n\\t\\topen, then the price is too high. My message to Congress is \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple -- you say you want to balance the budget, so let's say yes to \\r\\n\\t\\tbalancing the budget, but let us together say no to these deep and \\r\\n\\t\\tunwise cuts in education, technology, the environment, Medicare and \\r\\n\\t\\tMedicaid. Let's say no to raising taxes on the hardest- pressed working \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies in America. These things are not necessary to balancing the \\r\\n\\t\\tbudget. Yes to balancing the budget, no to the cuts. I know the loss of \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment service will cause disruption in the lives of millions of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans. We will do our very best to minimize this hardship. But there \\r\\n\\t\\tis, after all, a simple solution to the problem. All Congress has to do \\r\\n\\t\\tis to pass a straightforward bill to let government perform its duties \\r\\n\\t\\tand pay its debts. Then we can get back to work and resolve our \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferences over the budget in an open, honest, and straightforward \\r\\n\\t\\tmanner. Before I conclude, I'd like \\r\\n\\t\\tto say a word to the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who will \\r\\n\\t\\tbe affected by this partial shutdown. I know, as your fellow \\r\\n\\t\\tcitizens know, that the people who are affected by this shutdown are \\r\\n\\t\\tpublic servants. They're the people who process our Social Security \\r\\n\\t\\tapplications, help our veterans apply for benefits, care for the \\r\\n\\t\\tnational parks that are our natural heritage. They conduct the medical \\r\\n\\t\\tresearch that saves people's lives. They are important to America, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthey deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I will do \\r\\n\\t\\teverything I can to see that they receive back pay and that their \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies do not suffer because of this. But it is my solemn \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibility to stand against a budget plan that is bad for America \\r\\n\\t\\tand to stand up for a balanced budget that is good for America. And that \\r\\n\\t\\tis exactly what I intend to do. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator \\r\\nLeahy and members of the committee. Let me begin by thanking Senators Lugar and \\r\\nWarner and Bayh for their warm and generous introductions. And let me reiterate \\r\\nmy thanks to the President for nominating me. I\\'m humbled by his confidence and \\r\\nif confirmed I will do everything I can to be worthy of the high trust he has \\r\\nplaced in me. Let me also thank you, Mr. Chairman and the \\r\\nmembers of the committee, for the many courtesies you have extended to me and my \\r\\nfamily over the past eight weeks. I\\'m particularly grateful that members have \\r\\nbeen so accommodating in meeting with me personally. I have found those meetings \\r\\nvery useful in better understanding the concerns of the committee as the \\r\\ncommittee undertakes its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. I know that I would not be here today were it not \\r\\nfor the sacrifices and help over the years of my family, who you met earlier \\r\\ntoday, friends, mentors, teachers and colleagues, many of whom are here today. Last week one of those mentors and friends, Chief \\r\\nJustice William Rehnquist, was laid to rest. I talked last week with the nurses \\r\\nwho helped care for him over the past year. And I was glad to hear from them \\r\\nthat he was not a particularly good patient. He -- He chafed at the limitations they \\r\\ntried to impose. His dedication to duty over the past year was an inspiration to \\r\\nme and I know to many others. I -- I will miss him. My personal appreciation that I owe a great debt \\r\\nto others reinforces my view that a certain humility should characterize the \\r\\njudicial role. Judges and justices are servants of the law, not the other way \\r\\naround. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don\\'t make the \\r\\nrules; they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make \\r\\nsure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to \\r\\na ballgame to see the umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize \\r\\nthat they operate within a system of precedent shaped by other judges equally \\r\\nstriving to live up to the judicial oath. And judges have to have the modesty to \\r\\nbe open in the decisional process to the considered views of their colleagues on the bench. Mr. Chairman, when I worked in the Department of \\r\\nJustice in the office of the solicitor general, it was my job to argue cases for \\r\\nthe United States before the Supreme Court. I always found it very moving to \\r\\nstand before the justices and say, \"I speak for my country.\" But it was after I left the department and began \\r\\narguing cases against the United States that I fully appreciated the importance \\r\\nof the Supreme Court and our constitutional system. Here was the United States, \\r\\nthe most powerful entity in the world, aligned against my client. And yet all I \\r\\nhad to do was convince the Court that I was right on the law and the government \\r\\nwas wrong and all that power and might would recede in deference to the rule \\r\\nof law. That is a remarkable thing. It is what we mean \\r\\nwhen we say that we are a government of laws and not of men. It is that rule of \\r\\nlaw that protects the rights and liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of \\r\\nthe world, because without the rule of law any rights are meaningless. President Ronald Reagan used to speak of the \\r\\nSoviet Constitution. And he noted that it purported to grant wonderful rights of \\r\\nall sorts to people. But those rights were empty promises because that system \\r\\ndid not have an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law and enforce \\r\\nthose rights. We do, because of the wisdom of our founders and \\r\\nthe sacrifices of our heroes over the generations to make their vision a \\r\\nreality. Mr. Chairman, I come before the committee with no \\r\\nagenda. I have no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do \\r\\ncertain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda but I do have a commitment. If I \\r\\nam confirmed, I will confront every case with an open mind. I will fully and \\r\\nfairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented. I will be open to the \\r\\nconsidered views of my colleagues on the bench. And I will decide every case \\r\\nbased on the record, according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the \\r\\nbest of my ability. And I will remember that it\\'s my job to call balls \\r\\nand strikes and not pitch or bat. Senators Lugar and Bayh talked of my boyhood back \\r\\nhome in Indiana. I think all of us retain from the days of our youth certain enduring \\r\\nimages. For me those images are of the endless fields of Indiana stretching to \\r\\nthe horizon, punctuated only by an isolated silo or a barn. And as I grew older, those endless fields came to \\r\\nrepresent for me the limitless possibilities of our great land. Growing up I \\r\\nnever imagined that I would be here in this historic room nominated to be the \\r\\nChief Justice. But now that I am here I recall those endless fields with their \\r\\npromise of infinite possibilities. And that memory inspires in me a very profound \\r\\ncommitment. If I am confirmed I will be vigilant to protect the independence and \\r\\nintegrity of the Supreme Court. And I will work to ensure that it upholds the \\r\\nrule of law and safeguards those liberties that make this land one of endless \\r\\npossibilities for all Americans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of \\r\\nthe committee. I look forward to your questions.',\n",
       " 'Thank you all very much and good afternoon. It is a pleasure, once again, to be back on the campus of the George Washington University, a place that I have spent quite a bit of time in all different settings over the last now nearly 20 years. I\\x92d like especially to thank President Knapp and Provost Lerman, because this is a great opportunity for me to address such a significant issue, and one which deserves the attention of citizens, governments, and I know is drawing that attention. And perhaps today in my remarks, we can begin a much more vigorous debate that will respond to the needs that we have been watching in real time on our television sets. A few minutes after midnight on January 28th, the internet went dark across Egypt. During the previous four days, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians had marched to demand a new government. And the world, on TVs, laptops, cell phones, and smart phones, had followed every single step. Pictures and videos from Egypt flooded the web. On Facebook and Twitter, journalists posted on-the-spot reports. Protestors coordinated their next moves. And citizens of all stripes shared their hopes and fears about this pivotal moment in the history of their country. Millions worldwide answered in real time, \\x93You are not alone and we are with you.\\x94 Then the government pulled the plug. Cell phone service was cut off, TV satellite signals were jammed, and internet access was blocked for nearly the entire population. The government did not want the people to communicate with each other and it did not want the press to communicate with the public. It certainly did not want the world to watch. The events in Egypt recalled another protest movement 18 months earlier in Iran, when thousands marched after disputed elections. Their protestors also used websites to organize. A video taken by cell phone showed a young woman named Neda killed by a member of the paramilitary forces, and within hours, that video was being watched by people everywhere. The Iranian authorities used technology as well. The Revolutionary Guard stalked members of the Green Movement by tracking their online profiles. And like Egypt, for a time, the government shut down the internet and mobile networks altogether. After the authorities raided homes, attacked university dorms, made mass arrests, tortured and fired shots into crowds, the protests ended. In Egypt, however, the story ended differently. The protests continued despite the internet shutdown. People organized marches through flyers and word of mouth and used dial-up modems and fax machines to communicate with the world. After five days, the government relented and Egypt came back online. The authorities then sought to use the internet to control the protests by ordering mobile companies to send out pro-government text messages, and by arresting bloggers and those who organized the protests online. But 18 days after the protests began, the government failed and the president resigned. What happened in Egypt and what happened in Iran, which this week is once again using violence against protestors seeking basic freedoms, was about a great deal more than the internet. In each case, people protested because of deep frustrations with the political and economic conditions of their lives. They stood and marched and chanted and the authorities tracked and blocked and arrested them. The internet did not do any of those things; people did. In both of these countries, the ways that citizens and the authorities used the internet reflected the power of connection technologies on the one hand as an accelerant of political, social, and economic change, and on the other hand as a means to stifle or extinguish that change. There is a debate currently underway in some circles about whether the internet is a force for liberation or repression. But I think that debate is largely beside the point. Egypt isn\\x92t inspiring people because they communicated using Twitter. It is inspiring because people came together and persisted in demanding a better future. Iran isn\\x92t awful because the authorities used Facebook to shadow and capture members of the opposition. Iran is awful because it is a government that routinely violates the rights of its people. So it is our values that cause these actions to inspire or outrage us, our sense of human dignity, the rights that flow from it, and the principles that ground it. And it is these values that ought to drive us to think about the road ahead. Two billion people are now online, nearly a third of humankind. We hail from every corner of the world, live under every form of government, and subscribe to every system of beliefs. And increasingly, we are turning to the internet to conduct important aspects of our lives. The internet has become the public space of the 21st century \\x96 the world\\x92s town square, classroom, marketplace, coffeehouse, and nightclub. We all shape and are shaped by what happens there, all 2 billion of us and counting. And that presents a challenge. To maintain an internet that delivers the greatest possible benefits to the world, we need to have a serious conversation about the principles that will guide us, what rules exist and should not exist and why, what behaviors should be encouraged or discouraged and how. The goal is not to tell people how to use the internet any more than we ought to tell people how to use any public square, whether it\\x92s Tahrir Square or Times Square. The value of these spaces derives from the variety of activities people can pursue in them, from holding a rally to selling their vegetables, to having a private conversation. These spaces provide an open platform, and so does the internet. It does not serve any particular agenda, and it never should. But if people around the world are going come together every day online and have a safe and productive experience, we need a shared vision to guide us. One year ago, I offered a starting point for that vision by calling for a global commitment to internet freedom, to protect human rights online as we do offline. The rights of individuals to express their views freely, petition their leaders, worship according to their beliefs \\x96 these rights are universal, whether they are exercised in a public square or on an individual blog. The freedoms to assemble and associate also apply in cyberspace. In our time, people are as likely to come together to pursue common interests online as in a church or a labor hall. Together, the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association online comprise what I\\x92ve called the freedom to connect. The United States supports this freedom for people everywhere, and we have called on other nations to do the same. Because we want people to have the chance to exercise this freedom. We also support expanding the number of people who have access to the internet. And because the internet must work evenly and reliably for it to have value, we support the multi-stakeholder system that governs the internet today, which has consistently kept it up and running through all manner of interruptions across networks, borders, and regions. In the year since my speech, people worldwide have continued to use the internet to solve shared problems and expose public corruption, from the people in Russia who tracked wildfires online and organized a volunteer firefighting squad, to the children in Syria who used Facebook to reveal abuse by their teachers, to the internet campaign in China that helps parents find their missing children. At the same time, the internet continues to be restrained in a myriad of ways. In China, the government censors content and redirects search requests to error pages. In Burma, independent news sites have been taken down with distributed denial of service attacks. In Cuba, the government is trying to create a national intranet, while not allowing their citizens to access the global internet. In Vietnam, bloggers who criticize the government are arrested and abused. In Iran, the authorities block opposition and media websites, target social media, and steal identifying information about their own people in order to hunt them down. These actions reflect a landscape that is complex and combustible, and sure to become more so in the coming years as billions of more people connect to the internet. The choices we make today will determine what the internet looks like in the future. Businesses have to choose whether and how to enter markets where internet freedom is limited. People have to choose how to act online, what information to share and with whom, which ideas to voice and how to voice them. Governments have to choose to live up to their commitments to protect free expression, assembly, and association. For the United States, the choice is clear. On the spectrum of internet freedom, we place ourselves on the side of openness. Now, we recognize that an open internet comes with challenges. It calls for ground rules to protect against wrongdoing and harm. And internet freedom raises tensions, like all freedoms do. But we believe the benefits far exceed the costs. And today, I\\x92d like to discuss several of the challenges we must confront as we seek to protect and defend a free and open internet. Now, I\\x92m the first to say that neither I nor the United States Government has all the answers. We\\x92re not sure we have all the questions. But we are committed to asking the questions, to helping lead a conversation, and to defending not just universal principles but the interests of our people and our partners. The first challenge is achieving both liberty and security. Liberty and security are often presented as equal and opposite; the more you have of one, the less you have of the other. In fact, I believe they make it each other possible. Without security, liberty is fragile. Without liberty, security is oppressive. The challenge is finding the proper measure: enough security to enable our freedoms, but not so much or so little as to endanger them. Finding this proper measure for the internet is critical because the qualities that make the internet a force for unprecedented progress \\x96 its openness, its leveling effect, its reach and speed \\x96 also enable wrongdoing on an unprecedented scale. Terrorists and extremist groups use the internet to recruit members, and plot and carry out attacks. Human traffickers use the internet to find and lure new victims into modern-day slavery. Child pornographers use the internet to exploit children. Hackers break into financial institutions, cell phone networks, and personal email accounts. So we need successful strategies for combating these threats and more without constricting the openness that is the internet\\x92s greatest attribute. The United States is aggressively tracking and deterring criminals and terrorists online. We are investing in our nation\\x92s cyber-security, both to prevent cyber-incidents and to lessen their impact. We are cooperating with other countries to fight transnational crime in cyber-space. The United States Government invests in helping other nations build their own law enforcement capacity. We have also ratified the Budapest Cybercrime Convention, which sets out the steps countries must take to ensure that the internet is not misused by criminals and terrorists while still protecting the liberties of our own citizens. In our vigorous effort to prevent attacks or apprehend criminals, we retain a commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United States is determined to stop terrorism and criminal activity online and offline, and in both spheres we are committed to pursuing these goals in accordance with our laws and values. Now, others have taken a different approach. Security is often invoked as a justification for harsh crackdowns on freedom. Now, this tactic is not new to the digital age, but it has new resonance as the internet has given governments new capacities for tracking and punishing human rights advocates and political dissidents. Governments that arrest bloggers, pry into the peaceful activities of their citizens, and limit their access to the internet may claim to be seeking security. In fact, they may even mean it as they define it. But they are taking the wrong path. Those who clamp down on internet freedom may be able to hold back the full expression of their people\\x92s yearnings for a while, but not forever. The second challenge is protecting both transparency and confidentiality. The internet\\x92s strong culture of transparency derives from its power to make information of all kinds available instantly. But in addition to being a public space, the internet is also a channel for private communications. And for that to continue, there must be protection for confidential communication online. Think of all the ways in which people and organizations rely on confidential communications to do their jobs. Businesses hold confidential conversations when they\\x92re developing new products to stay ahead of their competitors. Journalists keep the details of some sources confidential to protect them from exposure or retribution. And governments also rely on confidential communication online as well as offline. The existence of connection technologies may make it harder to maintain confidentiality, but it does not alter the need for it. Now, I know that government confidentiality has been a topic of debate during the past few months because of WikiLeaks, but it\\x92s been a false debate in many ways. Fundamentally, the WikiLeaks incident began with an act of theft. Government documents were stolen, just the same as if they had been smuggled out in a briefcase. Some have suggested that this theft was justified because governments have a responsibility to conduct all of our work out in the open in the full view of our citizens. I respectfully disagree. The United States could neither provide for our citizens\\x92 security nor promote the cause of human rights and democracy around the world if we had to make public every step of our efforts. Confidential communication gives our government the opportunity to do work that could not be done otherwise. Consider our work with former Soviet states to secure loose nuclear material. By keeping the details confidential, we make it less likely that terrorists or criminals will find the nuclear material and steal it for their own purposes. Or consider the content of the documents that WikiLeaks made public. Without commenting on the authenticity of any particular documents, we can observe that many of the cables released by WikiLeaks relate to human rights work carried on around the world. Our diplomats closely collaborate with activists, journalists, and citizens to challenge the misdeeds of oppressive governments. It is dangerous work. By publishing diplomatic cables, WikiLeaks exposed people to even greater risk. For operations like these, confidentiality is essential, especially in the internet age when dangerous information can be sent around the world with the click of a keystroke. But of course, governments also have a duty to be transparent. We govern with the consent of the people, and that consent must be informed to be meaningful. So we must be judicious about when we close off our work to the public, and we must review our standards frequently to make sure they are rigorous. In the United States, we have laws designed to ensure that the government makes its work open to the people, and the Obama Administration has also launched an unprecedented initiative to put government data online, to encourage citizen participation, and to generally increase the openness of government. The U.S. Government\\x92s ability to protect America, to secure the liberties of our people, and to support the rights and freedoms of others around the world depends on maintaining a balance between what\\x92s public and what should and must remain out of the public domain. The scale should and will always be tipped in favor of openness, but tipping the scale over completely serves no one\\x92s interests. Let me be clear. I said that the WikiLeaks incident began with a theft, just as if it had been executed by smuggling papers in a briefcase. The fact that WikiLeaks used the internet is not the reason we criticized its actions. WikiLeaks does not challenge our commitment to internet freedom. And one final word on this matter: There were reports in the days following these leaks that the United States Government intervened to coerce private companies to deny service to WikiLeaks. That is not the case. Now, some politicians and pundits publicly called for companies to disassociate from WikiLeaks, while others criticized them for doing so. Public officials are part of our country\\x92s public debates, but there is a line between expressing views and coercing conduct. Business decisions that private companies may have taken to enforce their own values or policies regarding WikiLeaks were not at the direction of the Obama Administration. A third challenge is protecting free expression while fostering tolerance and civility. I don\\x92t need to tell this audience that the internet is home to every kind of speech \\x96 false, offensive, incendiary, innovative, truthful, and beautiful. The multitude of opinions and ideas that crowd the internet is both a result of its openness and a reflection of our human diversity. Online, everyone has a voice. And the Universal Declaration of Human Rights protects the freedom of expression for all. But what we say has consequences. Hateful or defamatory words can inflame hostilities, deepen divisions, and provoke violence. On the internet, this power is heightened. Intolerant speech is often amplified and impossible to retract. Of course, the internet also provides a unique space for people to bridge their differences and build trust and understanding. Some take the view that, to encourage tolerance, some hateful ideas must be silenced by governments. We believe that efforts to curb the content of speech rarely succeed and often become an excuse to violate freedom of expression. Instead, as it has historically been proven time and time again, the better answer to offensive speech is more speech. People can and should speak out against intolerance and hatred. By exposing ideas to debate, those with merit tend to be strengthened, while weak and false ideas tend to fade away; perhaps not instantly, but eventually. Now, this approach does not immediately discredit every hateful idea or convince every bigot to reverse his thinking. But we have determined as a society that it is far more effective than any other alternative approach. Deleting writing, blocking content, arresting speakers \\x96 these actions suppress words, but they do not touch the underlying ideas. They simply drive people with those ideas to the fringes, where their convictions can deepen, unchallenged. Last summer, Hannah Rosenthal, the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, made a trip to Dachau and Auschwitz with a delegation of American imams and Muslim leaders. Many of them had previously denied the Holocaust, and none of them had ever denounced Holocaust denial. But by visiting the concentration camps, they displayed a willingness to consider a different view. And the trip had a real impact. They prayed together, and they signed messages of peace, and many of those messages in the visitors books were written in Arabic. At the end of the trip, they read a statement that they wrote and signed together condemning without reservation Holocaust denial and all other forms of anti-Semitism. The marketplace of ideas worked. Now, these leaders had not been arrested for their previous stance or ordered to remain silent. Their mosques were not shut down. The state did not compel them with force. Others appealed to them with facts. And their speech was dealt with through the speech of others. The United States does restrict certain kinds of speech in accordance with the rule of law and our international obligations. We have rules about libel and slander, defamation, and speech that incites imminent violence. But we enforce these rules transparently, and citizens have the right to appeal how they are applied. And we don\\x92t restrict speech even if the majority of people find it offensive. History, after all, is full of examples of ideas that were banned for reasons that we now see as wrong. People were punished for denying the divine right of kings, or suggesting that people should be treated equally regardless of race, gender, or religion. These restrictions might have reflected the dominant view at the time, and variations on these restrictions are still in force in places around the world. But when it comes to online speech, the United States has chosen not to depart from our time-tested principles. We urge our people to speak with civility, to recognize the power and reach that their words can have online. We\\x92ve seen in our own country tragic examples of how online bullying can have terrible consequences. Those of us in government should lead by example, in the tone we set and the ideas we champion. But leadership also means empowering people to make their own choices, rather than intervening and taking those choices away. We protect free speech with the force of law, and we appeal to the force of reason to win out over hate. Now, these three large principles are not always easy to advance at once. They raise tensions, and they pose challenges. But we do not have to choose among them. Liberty and security, transparency and confidentiality, freedom of expression and tolerance \\x96 these all make up the foundation of a free, open, and secure society as well as a free, open, and secure internet where universal human rights are respected, and which provides a space for greater progress and prosperity over the long run. Now, some countries are trying a different approach, abridging rights online and working to erect permanent walls between different activities \\x96 economic exchanges, political discussions, religious expressions, and social interactions. They want to keep what they like and suppress what they don\\x92t. But this is no easy task. Search engines connect businesses to new customers, and they also attract users because they deliver and organize news and information. Social networking sites aren\\x92t only places where friends share photos; they also share political views and build support for social causes or reach out to professional contacts to collaborate on new business opportunities. Walls that divide the internet, that block political content, or ban broad categories of expression, or allow certain forms of peaceful assembly but prohibit others, or intimidate people from expressing their ideas are far easier to erect than to maintain. Not just because people using human ingenuity find ways around them and through them but because there isn\\x92t an economic internet and a social internet and a political internet; there\\x92s just the internet. And maintaining barriers that attempt to change this reality entails a variety of costs \\x96 moral, political, and economic. Countries may be able to absorb these costs for a time, but we believe they are unsustainable in the long run. There are opportunity costs for trying to be open for business but closed for free expression \\x96 costs to a nation\\x92s education system, its political stability, its social mobility, and its economic potential. When countries curtail internet freedom, they place limits on their economic future. Their young people don\\x92t have full access to the conversations and debates happening in the world or exposure to the kind of free inquiry that spurs people to question old ways of doing and invent new ones. And barring criticism of officials makes governments more susceptible to corruption, which create economic distortions with long-term effects. Freedom of thought and the level playing field made possible by the rule of law are part of what fuels innovation economies. So it\\x92s not surprising that the European-American Business Council, a group of more than 70 companies, made a strong public support statement last week for internet freedom. If you invest in countries with aggressive censorship and surveillance policies, your website could be shut down without warning, your servers hacked by the government, your designs stolen, or your staff threatened with arrest or expulsion for failing to comply with a politically motivated order. The risks to your bottom line and to your integrity will at some point outweigh the potential rewards, especially if there are market opportunities elsewhere. Now, some have pointed to a few countries, particularly China, that appears to stand out as an exception, a place where internet censorship is high and economic growth is strong. Clearly, many businesses are willing to endure restrictive internet policies to gain access to those markets, and in the short term, even perhaps in the medium term, those governments may succeed in maintaining a segmented internet. But those restrictions will have long-term costs that threaten one day to become a noose that restrains growth and development. There are political costs as well. Consider Tunisia, where online economic activity was an important part of the country\\x92s ties with Europe while online censorship was on par with China and Iran, the effort to divide the economic internet from the \\x93everything else\\x94 internet in Tunisia could not be sustained. People, especially young people, found ways to use connection technologies to organize and share grievances, which, as we know, helped fuel a movement that led to revolutionary change. In Syria, too, the government is trying to negotiate a non-negotiable contradiction. Just last week, it lifted a ban on Facebook and YouTube for the first time in three years, and yesterday they convicted a teenage girl of espionage and sentenced her to five years in prison for the political opinions she expressed on her blog. This, too, is unsustainable. The demand for access to platforms of expression cannot be satisfied when using them lands you in prison. We believe that governments who have erected barriers to internet freedom, whether they\\x92re technical filters or censorship regimes or attacks on those who exercise their rights to expression and assembly online, will eventually find themselves boxed in. They will face a dictator\\x92s dilemma and will have to choose between letting the walls fall or paying the price to keep them standing, which means both doubling down on a losing hand by resorting to greater oppression and enduring the escalating opportunity cost of missing out on the ideas that have been blocked and people who have been disappeared. I urge countries everywhere instead to join us in the bet we have made, a bet that an open internet will lead to stronger, more prosperous countries. At its core, it\\x92s an extension of the bet that the United States has been making for more than 200 years, that open societies give rise to the most lasting progress, that the rule of law is the firmest foundation for justice and peace, and that innovation thrives where ideas of all kinds are aired and explored. This is not a bet on computers or mobile phones. It\\x92s a bet on people. We\\x92re confident that together with those partners in government and people around the world who are making the same bet by hewing to universal rights that underpin open societies, we\\x92ll preserve the internet as an open space for all. And that will pay long-term gains for our shared progress and prosperity. The United States will continue to promote an internet where people\\x92s rights are protected and that it is open to innovation, interoperable all over the world, secure enough to hold people\\x92s trust, and reliable enough to support their work. In the past year, we have welcomed the emergence of a global coalition of countries, businesses, civil society groups, and digital activists seeking to advance these goals. We have found strong partners in several governments worldwide, and we\\x92ve been encouraged by the work of the Global Network Initiative, which brings together companies, academics, and NGOs to work together to solve the challenges we are facing, like how to handle government requests for censorship or how to decide whether to sell technologies that could be used to violate rights or how to handle privacy issues in the context of cloud computing. We need strong corporate partners that have made principled, meaningful commitments to internet freedom as we work together to advance this common cause. We realize that in order to be meaningful, online freedoms must carry over into real-world activism. That\\x92s why we are working through our Civil Society 2.0 initiative to connect NGOs and advocates with technology and training that will magnify their impact. We are also committed to continuing our conversation with people everywhere around the world. Last week, you may have heard, we launched Twitter feeds in Arabic and Farsi, adding to the ones we already have in French and Spanish. We\\x92ll start similar ones in Chinese, Russian, and Hindi. This is enabling us to have real-time, two-way conversations with people wherever there is a connection that governments do not block. Our commitment to internet freedom is a commitment to the rights of people, and we are matching that with our actions. Monitoring and responding to threats to internet freedom has become part of the daily work of our diplomats and development experts. They are working to advance internet freedom on the ground at our embassies and missions around the world. The United States continues to help people in oppressive internet environments get around filters, stay one step ahead of the censors, the hackers, and the thugs who beat them up or imprison them for what they say online. While the rights we seek to protect and support are clear, the various ways that these rights are violated are increasingly complex. I know some have criticized us for not pouring funding into a single technology, but we believe there is no silver bullet in the struggle against internet repression. There\\x92s no app for that. (Laughter.) Start working, those of you out there. (Laughter.) And accordingly, we are taking a comprehensive and innovative approach, one that matches our diplomacy with technology, secure distribution networks for tools, and direct support for those on the front lines. In the last three years, we have awarded more than $20 million in competitive grants through an open process, including interagency evaluation by technical and policy experts to support a burgeoning group of technologists and activists working at the cutting edge of the fight against internet repression. This year, we will award more than $25 million in additional funding. We are taking a venture capital-style approach, supporting a portfolio of technologies, tools, and training, and adapting as more users shift to mobile devices. We have our ear to the ground, talking to digital activists about where they need help, and our diversified approach means we\\x92re able to adapt the range of threats that they face. We support multiple tools, so if repressive governments figure out how to target one, others are available. And we invest in the cutting edge because we know that repressive governments are constantly innovating their methods of oppression and we intend to stay ahead of them. Likewise, we are leading the push to strengthen cyber security and online innovation, building capacity in developing countries, championing open and interoperable standards and enhancing international cooperation to respond to cyber threats. Deputy Secretary of Defense Lynn gave a speech on this issue just yesterday. All these efforts build on a decade of work to sustain an internet that is open, secure, and reliable. And in the coming year, the Administration will complete an international strategy for cyberspace, charting the course to continue this work into the future. This is a foreign policy priority for us, one that will only increase in importance in the coming years. That\\x92s why I\\x92ve created the Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, to enhance our work on cyber security and other issues and facilitate cooperation across the State Department and with other government agencies. I\\x92ve named Christopher Painter, formerly senior director for cyber security at the National Security Council and a leader in the field for 20 years, to head this new office. The dramatic increase in internet users during the past 10 years has been remarkable to witness. But that was just the opening act. In the next 20 years, nearly 5 billion people will join the network. It is those users who will decide the future. So we are playing for the long game. Unlike much of what happens online, progress on this front will be measured in years, not seconds. The course we chart today will determine whether those who follow us will get the chance to experience the freedom, security, and prosperity of an open internet. As we look ahead, let us remember that internet freedom isn\\x92t about any one particular activity online. It\\x92s about ensuring that the internet remains a space where activities of all kinds can take place, from grand, ground-breaking, historic campaigns to the small, ordinary acts that people engage in every day. We want to keep the internet open for the protestor using social media to organize a march in Egypt; the college student emailing her family photos of her semester abroad; the lawyer in Vietnam blogging to expose corruption; the teenager in the United States who is bullied and finds words of support online; for the small business owner in Kenya using mobile banking to manage her profits; the philosopher in China reading academic journals for her dissertation; the scientist in Brazil sharing data in real time with colleagues overseas; and the billions and billions of interactions with the internet every single day as people communicate with loved ones, follow the news, do their jobs, and participate in the debates shaping their world. Internet freedom is about defending the space in which all these things occur so that it remains not just for the students here today, but your successors and all who come after you. This is one of the grand challenges of our time. We are engaged in a vigorous effort against those who we have always stood against, who wish to stifle and repress, to come forward with their version of reality and to accept none other. We enlist your help on behalf of this struggle. It\\x92s a struggle for human rights, it\\x92s a struggle for human freedom, and it\\x92s a struggle for human dignity. Thank you all very much.',\n",

He\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tbetting that the perils of today\\'s world will blind us to its unlimited \\r\\n\\t\\tpromise.\\xa0He\\'s taken the Republican Party a long way\\xa0from \"Morning in \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica\" to \\xa0\"Midnight in America.\"\\xa0He wants us to fear the future and \\r\\n\\t\\tfear each other.\\xa0Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano \\r\\n\\t\\tRoosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago, during a much more perilous time. \\xa0\\x93The only thing we have to \\r\\n\\t\\tfear is fear itself.\\x94 Now we \\r\\n\\t\\tare clear-eyed about what our country is up against.\\xa0But we are not \\r\\n\\t\\tafraid.\\xa0We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have.\\xa0We will \\r\\n\\t\\tnot build a wall.\\xa0Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who \\r\\n\\t\\twants a good paying job can get one. And we\\'ll \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already \\r\\n\\t\\tcontributing to our\\xa0economy.\\xa0We will not ban a religion.\\xa0We will work \\r\\n\\t\\twith all Americans and our allies to fight terrorism.\\xa0There\\'s a lot of \\r\\n\\t\\twork to do.\\xa0Too many people haven\\'t had a pay raise since \\r\\n\\t\\tthe\\xa0crash.\\xa0There\\'s too much inequality.\\xa0Too little social mobility. Too \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad. But just \\r\\n\\t\\tlook at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges.\\xa0We have the \\r\\n\\t\\tmost dynamic and diverse people in the world.\\xa0We have the most tolerant \\r\\n\\t\\tand generous young people we\\'ve ever had. We have the most powerful \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values. Freedom \\r\\n\\t\\tand equality, justice and opportunity.\\xa0We should be so proud that these \\r\\n\\t\\twords are associated with us. \\xa0That when people\\xa0hear them -- they hear\\x85 \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica.\\xa0So don\\'t let anyone tell you that our country is weak.\\xa0We\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tnot.\\xa0Don\\'t let anyone tell you we don\\'t have what it takes.\\xa0We do.\\xa0And \\r\\n\\t\\tmost of all, don\\'t believe anyone who says: \\x93I alone can fix it.\\x94\\xa0Those \\r\\n\\t\\twere actually Donald Trump\\'s words in Cleveland.\\xa0And they should set off \\r\\n\\t\\talarm bells for all of us. Really? \\r\\n\\t\\t\\'I alone can fix it?\\' Isn\\'t he \\r\\n\\t\\tforgetting?\\xa0Troops on the front lines.\\xa0Police officers and fire fighters \\r\\n\\t\\twho run toward danger.\\xa0Doctors and nurses who care for us.\\xa0Teachers who \\r\\n\\t\\tchange lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every \\r\\n\\t\\tproblem.\\xa0Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a \\r\\n\\t\\tmovement to keep other kids safe. He\\'s forgetting every last one of \\r\\n\\t\\tus.\\xa0Americans don\\'t say: \\xa0\\x93I alone can fix it.\\x94 \\xa0We say: \\x93We\\'ll fix it \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether.\\x94\\xa0Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe power. Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in \\r\\n\\t\\teach other. Look at \\r\\n\\t\\twhat happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police \\r\\n\\t\\tofficers. Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, \\r\\n\\t\\tmaybe even join them.\\xa0And you know how the community responded?\\xa0\\xa0Nearly \\r\\n\\t\\t500 people applied in just 12 days.\\xa0That\\'s how Americans answer when the \\r\\n\\t\\tcall for help goes out. \\xa020 years ago,\\xa0I wrote a book called \\x93It Takes a \\r\\n\\t\\tVillage.\\x94 A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck \\r\\n\\t\\tdo you mean by that? \\xa0This is what I mean:\\xa0None of us can raise a \\r\\n\\t\\tfamily, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally \\r\\n\\t\\talone. America \\r\\n\\t\\tneeds every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking our nation better and stronger. \\xa0I believe that with all my \\r\\n\\t\\theart.\\xa0That\\'s why \\x93Stronger Together\\x94 is not just a lesson from our \\r\\n\\t\\thistory.\\xa0It\\'s not just a slogan for our campaign. \\xa0It\\'s a guiding \\r\\n\\t\\tprinciple for the country we\\'ve always been and the future we\\'re going \\r\\n\\t\\tto build. A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those \\r\\n\\t\\tat the top.\\xa0Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good \\r\\n\\t\\tschool, no matter what zip code you live in.\\xa0A country where all our \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren can dream, and those dreams are within reach.\\xa0Where families \\r\\n\\t\\tare strong,\\xa0communities are safe,\\xa0and yes -- love trumps hate.\\xa0That\\'s the \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry we\\'re fighting for.\\xa0That\\'s the future we\\'re working toward. And so it \\r\\n\\t\\tis with humility,\\xa0determination, and boundless confidence in America\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tpromise,\\xa0that I accept your nomination for President of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited\\xa0States. Now, \\r\\n\\t\\tsometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As \\r\\n\\t\\tyou know, I\\'m not one of those people.\\xa0I\\'ve been your First Lady,\\xa0served \\r\\n\\t\\t8 years as a Senator from the great State of New York,\\xa0\\xa0I ran for \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident and lost.\\xa0Then I represented all of you as Secretary of \\r\\n\\t\\tState.\\xa0But my job titles only tell you what I\\'ve done.\\xa0They don\\'t tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou why. \\xa0The truth is, through all these years of public service, the \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93service\\x94 part has always come easier to me than the \\x93public\\x94 part. I get it \\r\\n\\t\\tthat some people just don\\'t know what to make of me. \\xa0So let me tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou.\\xa0The family I\\'m from, well, no one had their name on \\r\\n\\t\\tbig\\xa0buildings.\\xa0My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had -- \\r\\n\\t\\twhatever God gave them -- and whatever life in America provided -- and \\r\\n\\t\\tbuilt better lives and better futures for their kids. My grandfather \\r\\n\\t\\tworked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years, because he believed \\r\\n\\t\\tthat if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life \\r\\n\\t\\tthan he did. And he was right. My dad, \\r\\n\\t\\tHugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted \\r\\n\\t\\tin the Navy after Pearl Harbor. \\xa0When the war was over he started his \\r\\n\\t\\town small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching \\r\\n\\t\\thim stand for hours over silk screens. He wanted to give my brothers and \\r\\n\\t\\tme\\xa0opportunities he never had. And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was \\r\\n\\t\\tabandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, \\r\\n\\t\\tworking as a house maid.\\xa0She was saved by the kindness of others.\\xa0Her \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought \\r\\n\\t\\textra food to share. The \\r\\n\\t\\tlesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me:\\xa0No one gets \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each \\r\\n\\t\\tother up. She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith:\\xa0\\x93Do \\r\\n\\t\\tall the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan, as long as ever you can.\\x94\\xa0I went to work for the Children\\'s Defense \\r\\n\\t\\tFund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren with disabilities who were denied the chance\\xa0to go to school.\\xa0I \\r\\n\\t\\tremember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of \\r\\n\\t\\ther house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school -- it just \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t seem possible.\\xa0And I couldn\\'t stop thinking of my mother and what \\r\\n\\t\\tshe went through as a child.\\xa0It became clear to me that simply caring is \\r\\n\\t\\tnot enough.\\xa0To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws.\\xa0You need both understanding and action.\\xa0So we gathered facts. We built \\r\\n\\t\\ta coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to \\r\\n\\t\\teducation for all students with disabilities. It\\'s a \\r\\n\\t\\tbig idea, isn\\'t it? \\xa0Every kid with a disability has the right to go to \\r\\n\\t\\tschool. \\xa0\\xa0But how do you make an idea like that real? \\xa0You do it \\r\\n\\t\\tstep-by-step, year-by-year\\x85 sometimes even door-by-door. \\xa0And my heart \\r\\n\\t\\tjust swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing \\r\\n\\t\\tmillions of young people who -- because of those changes to our laws -- \\r\\n\\t\\tare able to get an education. \\xa0It\\'s true... I sweat the details of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicy -- whether we\\'re talking about the exact level of lead in the \\r\\n\\t\\tdrinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health \\r\\n\\t\\tfacilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs. Because it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tnot just a detail if it\\'s your kid - if it\\'s your family. \\xa0It\\'s a big \\r\\n\\t\\tdeal. And it should be a big deal to your President. Over the \\r\\n\\t\\tlast three days, you\\'ve seen some of the people who\\'ve inspired \\r\\n\\t\\tme.\\xa0People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine. People \\r\\n\\t\\tlike Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning.\\xa0They told their stories Tuesday \\r\\n\\t\\tnight.\\xa0I first met Ryan as a seven-year old. \\xa0\\xa0He was wearing a full \\r\\n\\t\\tbody brace that must have weighed forty pounds. Children like Ryan kept \\r\\n\\t\\tme going when our plan for universal health care failed\\xa0and kept me \\r\\n\\t\\tworking with leaders of both parties to help create the Children\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tHealth Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year. Lauren \\r\\n\\t\\twas gravely injured on 9/11.\\xa0It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies, and our first responders who got sick from their time at \\r\\n\\t\\tGround Zero.\\xa0I was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others \\r\\n\\t\\tten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tmade the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to \\r\\n\\t\\tjustice. In this \\r\\n\\t\\tcampaign, I\\'ve met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for \\r\\n\\t\\tchange.\\xa0And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories \\r\\n\\t\\twith me to the White House.\\xa0I will be a President for Democrats, \\r\\n\\t\\tRepublicans, and Independents.\\xa0For the struggling, the striving and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsuccessful.\\xa0\\xa0For those who vote for me and those who don\\'t. For all \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans. Tonight, \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'ve reached a milestone in our nation\\'s march toward a more perfect \\r\\n\\t\\tunion:\\xa0\\xa0the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident. Standing here as my mother\\'s daughter, and my daughter\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tmother, I\\'m so happy this day has come.\\xa0Happy for grandmothers and \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle girls and everyone in between.\\xa0Happy for boys and men, too \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way \\r\\n\\t\\tfor everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky\\'s the limit.\\xa0So let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica has the opportunity she deserves.\\xa0Because even more important \\r\\n\\t\\tthan the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together \\r\\n\\t\\tin the years ahead.\\xa0Let\\'s begin with what we\\'re going to do to help \\r\\n\\t\\tworking people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.\\xa0Now, I don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tthink President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our \\r\\n\\t\\teconomy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with \\r\\n\\t\\thealth insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s real progress. But none \\r\\n\\t\\tof us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot. We\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tstill facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the \\r\\n\\t\\trecession and have stayed with us through the\\xa0recovery. \\xa0\\xa0I\\'ve gone \\r\\n\\t\\taround our country talking to working families. And I\\'ve heard from so \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of you who feel like the economy just isn\\'t working.\\xa0Some of you \\r\\n\\t\\tare frustrated -- even furious.\\xa0And you know what? You\\'re right.\\xa0It\\'s not \\r\\n\\t\\tyet working the way it should.\\xa0Americans are willing to work -- and work \\r\\n\\t\\thard. \\xa0\\xa0But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and \\r\\n\\t\\tless respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period. \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrats are the party of working people,\\xa0but we haven\\'t done a good \\r\\n\\t\\tenough job showing that we get what you\\'re going through,\\xa0and that we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to do something about it. So I want \\r\\n\\t\\tto tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives. My \\r\\n\\t\\tprimary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more \\r\\n\\t\\tgood jobs with rising wages right here in the United States,\\xa0from my \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst day in office to my last.\\xa0Especially in places that for too long \\r\\n\\t\\thave been left out and left behind.\\xa0From our inner cities to our small \\r\\n\\t\\ttowns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by \\r\\n\\t\\taddiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures. And \\r\\n\\t\\there\\'s what I believe.\\xa0I believe America thrives when the middle class \\r\\n\\t\\tthrives.\\xa0\\xa0I believe that our economy isn\\'t working the way it should \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause our democracy isn\\'t working the way it should. That\\'s why we \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And we\\'ll pass a \\r\\n\\t\\tconstitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!\\xa0I believe American \\r\\n\\t\\tcorporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as \\r\\n\\t\\tpatriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren\\'t.\\xa0It\\'s wrong \\r\\n\\t\\tto take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main \\r\\n\\t\\tStreet again.\\xa0I believe in science. I believe that climate change is \\r\\n\\t\\treal and that we can save our planet while creating millions of \\r\\n\\t\\tgood-paying clean energy jobs.\\xa0I believe that when we have millions of \\r\\n\\t\\thardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be \\r\\n\\t\\tself-defeating and inhumane to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration \\r\\n\\t\\treform will grow our economy and keep families together - and it\\'s the \\r\\n\\t\\tright thing to do. Whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no \\r\\n\\t\\tparty at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign. If you \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad \\r\\n\\t\\texecutive bonuses, join us. If you \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve the minimum wage should be a living wage,\\xa0and no one working \\r\\n\\t\\tfull time should have to raise their children in poverty\\x85 join us.\\xa0If \\r\\n\\t\\tyou believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to \\r\\n\\t\\taffordable health care\\x85 join us.\\xa0If you believe that we should say \\x93no\\x94 \\r\\n\\t\\tto unfair trade deals... that we should stand up to China,\\xa0that we \\r\\n\\t\\tshould support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown \\r\\n\\t\\tmanufacturers\\x85join us. If you \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve we should expand Social Security and protect a woman\\'s right to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake her own health care decisions\\x85 join us.\\xa0And yes, if you believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthat your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay\\x85 \\r\\n\\t\\tjoin us. Let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tmake sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the \\r\\n\\t\\ttop.\\xa0\\xa0Now, you didn\\'t hear any of this from Donald Trump at his \\r\\n\\t\\tconvention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes -- and I do mean odd. And he \\r\\n\\t\\toffered zero solutions. \\xa0But we already know he doesn\\'t believe these \\r\\n\\t\\tthings.\\xa0No wonder he doesn\\'t like talking about his plans.\\xa0You might \\r\\n\\t\\thave noticed, I love talking about mine.\\xa0\\xa0In my first 100 days, we will \\r\\n\\t\\twork with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, \\r\\n\\t\\tgood-paying jobs since World War II. \\xa0Jobs in manufacturing, clean \\r\\n\\t\\tenergy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure. \\r\\n\\t\\tIf we invest in infrastructure now, we\\'ll not only create jobs today, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will transform \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way we prepare our young people for those jobs. Bernie Sanders and I \\r\\n\\t\\twill work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and \\r\\n\\t\\tdebt-free for all. We will \\r\\n\\t\\talso liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It\\'s just \\r\\n\\t\\tnot right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies can\\'t refinance theirs.\\xa0And here\\'s something we don\\'t say often \\r\\n\\t\\tenough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the \\r\\n\\t\\tonly path to a good job.\\xa0We\\'re going to help more people learn a skill \\r\\n\\t\\tor practice a trade and make a good living doing it.\\xa0We\\'re going to give \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too \\r\\n\\t\\tmany dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can \\r\\n\\t\\tdream it, you should be able to build it.\\xa0\\xa0We\\'re going to help you \\r\\n\\t\\tbalance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable \\r\\n\\t\\tchild care and paid family leave is playing the \\x93woman card,\\x94 then Deal \\r\\n\\t\\tMe In!\\xa0(Oh, you\\'ve heard that one?)\\xa0Now, here\\'s the thing, we\\'re not \\r\\n\\t\\tonly going to make all these investments, we\\'re going to pay for every \\r\\n\\t\\tsingle one of them.\\xa0And here\\'s how: Wall Street, corporations, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsuper-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. Not \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we resent success. Because when more than 90% of the gains have \\r\\n\\t\\tgone to the top 1%, that\\'s where the money is.\\xa0And if companies take tax \\r\\n\\t\\tbreaks and then ship jobs overseas, we\\'ll make them\\xa0pay us back. \\xa0And \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'ll put that money to work where it belongs \\x85 creating jobs here at \\r\\n\\t\\thome!\\xa0Now I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all \\r\\n\\t\\tsounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are \\r\\n\\t\\tyou going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Look at my \\r\\n\\t\\trecord. \\xa0I\\x92ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to \\r\\n\\t\\tlaunch new programs that help millions of people. \\xa0And if you give me \\r\\n\\t\\tthe chance, that\\x92s what I\\x92ll do as President.\\xa0But Trump, he\\'s a \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinessman. \\xa0He must know something about the economy. \\xa0\\xa0Well, let\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\ttake a closer look.\\xa0\\xa0In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you\\'ll find \\r\\n\\t\\tcontractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald \\r\\n\\t\\tTrump refused to pay his bills. People \\r\\n\\t\\twho did the work and needed the money, and didn\\'t get it -- not because \\r\\n\\t\\the couldn\\'t pay them, but because he wouldn\\'t pay them. That \\r\\n\\t\\tsales pitch he\\'s making to be your President? \\xa0Put your faith in him \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tand you\\'ll win big? \\xa0That\\'s the same sales pitch he made to all those \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people \\r\\n\\t\\tholding the bag. \\xa0\\xa0He also talks a big game about putting America First. \\r\\n\\t\\tPlease explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump \\r\\n\\t\\tties in China, not Colorado. \\xa0Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump \\r\\n\\t\\tfurniture in Turkey, not Ohio. \\xa0Trump picture frames in India, not \\r\\n\\t\\tWisconsin.\\xa0Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\twell, he could start\\xa0by actually making things in America again. The \\r\\n\\t\\tchoice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From \\r\\n\\t\\tBaghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and \\r\\n\\t\\tOrlando, we\\'re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.\\xa0No \\r\\n\\t\\twonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for \\r\\n\\t\\tsteady leadership. You want a leader who understands we are stronger \\r\\n\\t\\twhen we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans \\r\\n\\t\\there at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it \\r\\n\\t\\twill be my highest priority. I\\'m proud that we put a lid on Iran\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tnuclear program without firing a single shot -- now we have to enforce \\r\\n\\t\\tit, and keep supporting Israel\\'s security. I\\'m proud \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we shaped a global climate agreement -- now we have to hold every \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry accountable to their commitments, including ourselves. I\\'m proud \\r\\n\\t\\tto stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom Russia.\\xa0I\\'ve laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will \\r\\n\\t\\tstrike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking \\r\\n\\t\\tthem out on the ground.\\xa0We will surge our intelligence so that we detect \\r\\n\\t\\tand prevent attacks before they happen.\\xa0We will disrupt their efforts \\r\\n\\t\\tonline to reach and radicalize young people in our country.\\xa0It won\\'t be \\r\\n\\t\\teasy or quick, but make no mistake -- we will prevail. Now \\r\\n\\t\\tDonald Trump says, and this is a quote, \\x93I know more about ISIS than the \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerals do\\x85.\\x94 No, \\r\\n\\t\\tDonald, you don\\'t. He thinks that he knows more than our military \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause he claimed our armed forces are \\x93a disaster.\\x94 Well, \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0for many years, including as a Senator on the Armed Services Committee. \\r\\n\\t\\tI know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.\\xa0We entrust \\r\\n\\t\\tour commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation \\r\\n\\t\\tfaces.\\xa0Decisions about war and peace. Life and death. A \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve \\r\\n\\t\\tour country -- including the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both \\r\\n\\t\\tMarines. Ask \\r\\n\\t\\tyourself: \\xa0Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be \\r\\n\\t\\tCommander-in-Chief? Donald Trump can\\'t even handle the rough-and-tumble \\r\\n\\t\\tof a Presidential campaign.\\xa0He loses his cool at the slightest \\r\\n\\t\\tprovocation. When he\\'s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When \\r\\n\\t\\the\\'s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a \\r\\n\\t\\trally.\\xa0Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\\xa0I \\r\\n\\t\\tcan\\'t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile \\r\\n\\t\\tCrisis.\\xa0She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very \\r\\n\\t\\tdangerous time was that a war might be started -- not by big men with \\r\\n\\t\\tself-control and restraint, but by little men -- the ones moved by fear \\r\\n\\t\\tand pride. America\\'s strength doesn\\'t come from lashing out.\\xa0Strength \\r\\n\\t\\trelies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic \\r\\n\\t\\tapplication of power. That\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tthe kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be. And if \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'re serious about keeping our country safe, we also can\\'t afford to \\r\\n\\t\\thave a President who\\'s in the pocket of the gun lobby. \\xa0I\\'m not here to \\r\\n\\t\\trepeal the 2nd Amendment.\\xa0I\\'m not here to take away your guns.\\xa0I just \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn\\'t have a gun in the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst place.\\xa0We should be working with responsible gun owners to pass \\r\\n\\t\\tcommon-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, \\r\\n\\t\\tterrorists and all others who would do us harm. For \\r\\n\\t\\tdecades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics were too hot to touch. But I ask you: how can we just stand by \\r\\n\\t\\tand do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by \\r\\n\\t\\tgun violence.\\xa0You heard, you saw, family members of police officers \\r\\n\\t\\tkilled in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.\\xa0I \\r\\n\\t\\trefuse to believe we can\\'t find common ground here. We have \\r\\n\\t\\tto heal the divides in our country.\\xa0Not just on guns, but on race, \\r\\n\\t\\timmigration,\\xa0and more.\\xa0\\xa0That starts with listening to each other. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tshoes.\\xa0So let\\'s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men \\r\\n\\t\\tand women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel \\r\\n\\t\\tlike their lives are disposable. Let\\'s put ourselves in the shoes of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolice officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and \\r\\n\\t\\theading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will \\r\\n\\t\\treform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust \\r\\n\\t\\tbetween law enforcement and the communities they serve.\\xa0We will defend \\r\\n\\t\\tall our rights -- civil rights, human rights and voting rights,\\xa0women\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\trights, and workers\\' rights,\\xa0LGBT rights and the rights of people with \\r\\n\\t\\tdisabilities.\\xa0And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric \\r\\n\\t\\twherever it comes from. For the \\r\\n\\t\\tpast year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tcomments -- excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. \\xa0They \\r\\n\\t\\tthink he couldn\\'t possibly mean all the horrible things he says -- like \\r\\n\\t\\twhen he called women \\x93pigs.\\x94 Or said that an American judge couldn\\'t be \\r\\n\\t\\tfair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a \\r\\n\\t\\treporter with a disability.\\xa0Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain \\r\\n\\t\\t--a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect. \\xa0At first, I admit, I \\r\\n\\t\\tcouldn\\'t believe he meant it either. It was \\r\\n\\t\\tjust too hard to fathom -- that someone who wants to lead our nation \\r\\n\\t\\tcould say those things. Could be like that. But \\r\\n\\t\\there\\'s the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump...This is it.And in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn\\'t get: that America is \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat -- because America is good. \\xa0So enough with the bigotry and \\r\\n\\t\\tbombast. Donald Trump\\'s not offering real change.\\xa0\\xa0He\\'s offering empty \\r\\n\\t\\tpromises. \\xa0What are we offering? \\xa0A bold agenda to improve the lives of \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople across our country - to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and \\r\\n\\t\\tto give your kids the opportunities they deserve.\\xa0\\xa0The choice is clear. Every \\r\\n\\t\\tgeneration of Americans has come together to make our country freer, \\r\\n\\t\\tfairer, and stronger. None of us can do it alone. I\\xa0know \\r\\n\\t\\tthat at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard \\r\\n\\t\\tto imagine how we\\'ll ever pull together again.\\xa0But I\\'m here to tell you \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight -- progress is possible. \\xa0I know because I\\'ve seen it in the \\r\\n\\t\\tlives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back \\r\\n\\t\\tup.\\xa0\\xa0And I know it from my own life. \\xa0More than a few times, I\\'ve had to \\r\\n\\t\\tpick myself up and get back in the game.\\xa0Like so much else, I got this \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom my mother. \\xa0She never let me back down from any challenge. When I \\r\\n\\t\\ttried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93Go back out there,\\x94 she said.\\xa0And she was right. You have to stand up \\r\\n\\t\\tto bullies. You have \\r\\n\\t\\tto keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe opposition is fierce.\\xa0We lost my mother a few years ago. I miss her \\r\\n\\t\\tevery day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep \\r\\n\\t\\tfighting for right, no matter what.\\xa0That\\'s what we need to do together \\r\\n\\t\\tas a nation.\\xa0Though \"we may not live to see the glory,\" as the song from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe musical Hamilton goes, \"let us gladly join the fight.\" Let our \\r\\n\\t\\tlegacy be about \"planting seeds in a garden you never get to \\r\\n\\t\\tsee.\"\\xa0That\\'s why we\\'re here...not just in this hall, but on this \\r\\n\\t\\tEarth.\\xa0The Founders showed us that.\\xa0And so have many others since.They \\r\\n\\t\\twere drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild something better for all who follow.\\xa0That is the story of America. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd we begin a new chapter tonight.\\xa0Yes, the world is watching what we \\r\\n\\t\\tdo.\\xa0Yes, America\\'s destiny is ours to choose.\\xa0So let\\'s be stronger \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether.\\xa0Looking to the future with courage and confidence.\\xa0Building a \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.\\xa0When \\r\\n\\t\\twe do, America will be greater than ever. Thank you \\r\\n\\t\\tand may God bless the United States of America!',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much. \\r\\nThank you very much, General. I know that \\r\\nseated in the front of this hall are VMI cadets who have served in Iraq. I\\'m \\r\\ngrateful for your service, honored by your presence, and mindful that I speak to \\r\\nan audience that can discern truth from falsehood in a politician\\'s appraisal of \\r\\nthe war. You know, better than most, whether our cause is just, necessary, and \\r\\nwinnable. You have risked much to make it so. Thank you. I\\'d also like to salute \\r\\na few old comrades of mine, Orson Swindle, Jim Berger and Paul Galanti, whose \\r\\nexamples of steadfast courage helped to sustain me in a difficult time. This institution is \\r\\nsteeped in the ideals of service and sacrifice exemplified by the veterans here \\r\\ntoday. VMI has helped to form the character of many fine patriots, none greater \\r\\nthan George Marshall, whose long, selfless service to our country was of \\r\\ninestimable value in some of the most consequential moments of the last century. \\r\\nAs we celebrate this year the 60th anniversary of theMarshall Plan, VMI\\'s Corps \\r\\nof Cadets should take renewed pride from their association with his good name \\r\\n-- in knowing the lesson of his character and patriotism has been a part of \\r\\nyour education. I just returned from \\r\\nmy fifth visit to Iraq. Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more \\r\\nthreatening -- nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps. And my only mission was to inform my \\r\\nopinions with facts. We still face many difficult challenges in Iraq. That is \\r\\nundeniable. But we\\'ve also made, in recent weeks, memorable progress and measurable progress in \\r\\nestablishing security in Baghdad and fighting al Qaeda in Anbar province. To \\r\\ndeny the difficulties and uncertainties ahead is an egregious disservice to the \\r\\npublic. But as General Petraeus implements his plan to correct the flawed \\r\\nstrategy we followed in the past, and attempts to spare the United States and \\r\\nthe world the catastrophe of an American defeat, it is an equal disservice to \\r\\ndismiss early signs of progress. And now we confront a choice as historically \\r\\nimportant as any we have faced in a long while. Will this nation\\'s elected \\r\\nleaders make the politically hard but strategically vital decision to give \\r\\nGeneral Petraeus our full support and do what is necessary to succeed in Iraq? \\r\\nOr will we decide to take advantage of the public\\'s frustration, accept defeat, \\r\\nand hope that whatever the cost to our security the politics of defeat will work \\r\\nout better for us than our opponents? For my part, for my part, I would rather lose a \\r\\ncampaign than a war. However it ends, the \\r\\nwar in Iraq will have a profound influence on the future of the Middle East, \\r\\nglobal stability, and the security of the United States, which will remain, for \\r\\nthe foreseeable future, directly affected by events in that dangerous part of \\r\\nthe world. The war is part of a broader struggle in the Arab and Muslim world, \\r\\nthe struggle between violent extremists and the force of modernity and \\r\\nmoderation. In the early days after \\r\\n9/11, our country was united in a single purpose: to find the terrorists bent on \\r\\nour destruction and eliminate the threat they posed to us. In the intervening \\r\\nyears, we\\'ve learned the complexity of the struggle against radical Islamic \\r\\nideology. The extremists -- a tiny percentage of the hundreds of millions of \\r\\npeaceful Muslims -- are flexible, intelligent, determined and unconstrained by \\r\\ninternational borders. They wish to return the world to the 7th century, and \\r\\nthey will use any means, no matter how -- how inhumane, to eliminate anyone who stands \\r\\nin their way. But the vast majority of Muslims are trying to modernize their \\r\\nsocieties to meet the challenges of the 21st century. While al Qaeda seeks to \\r\\ndestroy, millions of Muslims attempt to build the same elements of a good life \\r\\nthat all of us want -- security, opportunity, peace, and hope. The war on terror, the \\r\\nwar for the future of the Middle East, and the struggle for the soul of Islam -- \\r\\nof which the war in Iraq constitutes a key element -- are bound together. \\r\\nProgress in -- in one requires progress in all. The many complex challenges we face \\r\\nrequire more than a military response. This is a context of ideas and values as \\r\\nmuch as it is one of bullets and bombs. We must gain the active support of \\r\\nmodernizers across the Muslim world, who want to share in the benefits of the \\r\\nglobal system and its economic success, and who aspire to the political freedom \\r\\nthat is, I truly believe, the natural desire of the human heart. No matter how \\r\\nmuch attention their ruthless tactics receive, terrorists are not the true face \\r\\nof Islam. Devout Muslims in Lebanon, Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, Morocco, \\r\\nBahrain, and in Iraq, aspire to progress for their societies in which basic \\r\\nhuman needs are met for more than the privileged few and basic human rights are \\r\\nrespected. The United States \\r\\nneeds stronger alliances, coalitions, and partnerships worldwide to engage this \\r\\nlong and multidimensional struggle. We need to pay careful attention to \\r\\nAmerica\\'s image and moral credibility. And in this broad effort, the outcome of \\r\\nthe war in Iraq will play a pivotal role. On my trip, I traveled \\r\\nto Baghdad, Ramadi, and Tikrit, and met with Iraqi cabinet officers, our top \\r\\nmilitary leadership, including Generals Petraeus and Odierno, and with embassy \\r\\nofficials, including our new ambassador, Ryan Crocker. I also had the privilege \\r\\nof spending time with our soldiers, from generals to privates. Their courage and \\r\\nresolve in this frustrating war is an inspiration, and serves as a reminder of \\r\\nour obligations to avoid the expediency of easy, but empty answers or the allure \\r\\nof political advantage to choose the path in Iraq that best honors their \\r\\nsacrifices. We\\'re going to need \\r\\ntheir courage more than ever. The divisions in Iraqi society are deep, and the \\r\\nneed for greater security critical. Innocent Iraqis are still being murdered, \\r\\nand our soldiers are braving dangers no less threatening than in the past. Every \\r\\nday we read about or watch on television the latest car bombing, IED explosion \\r\\nor sniper attack. But something else is happening, too. There are the first \\r\\nglimmers of progress under General Petraeus\\' political-military strategy. While \\r\\nthese glimmers are no guarantee of success, and though they come early in the \\r\\nimplementation of the new strategy, I believe they are cause for cautious \\r\\noptimism. For the first time in \\r\\nmy visits to Iraq, our delegation was able to drive -- not fly by helicopter -- \\r\\nfrom the airport to downtown Baghdad. For the first time we met with a Sunni \\r\\ntribal leader in Anbar province, who is working with American and Iraqi forces \\r\\nto fight al Qaeda. Sixteen of the twenty-four Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar are \\r\\nnow working with us. We visited Iraqi and American forces deployed together in \\r\\nBaghdad -- an integral part of the new security plan -- where they maintain a \\r\\npresence in a neighborhood cleared of militias and terrorists, and hold the \\r\\nground they have retaken rather than return to base, after which the enemy \\r\\nreturns to impose its will again on a defenseless population. The government of \\r\\nPrime Minister Maliki is delivering on its promise to deploy Iraqi brigades to \\r\\nBaghdad. A plan to share oil revenues equitably -- equitably among all Iraqis has been \\r\\napproved by Iraqi ministers and is pending approval by the parliament. After an \\r\\nimportant visit by Prime Minister Maliki to Ramadi in Sunni dominated Anbar, he \\r\\npromised a new policy to allay Sunni fears that they will be excluded from \\r\\nsharing in the political future of the country. An important result of the new \\r\\nsecurity plan is the cooperation we are receiving from the Iraqi people, who are \\r\\nbeginning to provide us with actionable intelligence about the whereabouts and \\r\\nplans of the enemy. These welcome developments have occurred even though only \\r\\nthree of the five additional brigades have arrived. These and other \\r\\nindicators of progress are encouraging, but they are not determinative. I \\r\\nunderstand, and you understand, the damage false optimism does to public patience and support. I \\r\\nlearned long ago to be skeptical of official reports that are long on wishful \\r\\nthinking and short on substance. As we make progress in some areas, the enemy \\r\\nstrikes where we do not have as great a presence. But security in the capital is \\r\\nindispensable to a greater level of security throughout the country so that \\r\\npolitical and economic progress can occur. And in Baghdad, we are making \\r\\nprogress. We have a long way to go, but for the first time in four years, we \\r\\nhave a strategy that deals with how things really are in Iraq and not how we \\r\\nwish them to be. After my first visit \\r\\nto Iraq in 2003, I argued for more troops. I took issue with the statements \\r\\ncharacterizing the insurgency as a few \"dead-enders\" or being in its \"last \\r\\nthroes.\" I criticized the search and destroy strategy and argued for a \\r\\ncounter-insurgency approach that separated the reconcilable population from the \\r\\nirreconcilable. That is the course now followed by General Petraeus and the \\r\\nbrave Americans and coalitional troops he has the honor to command. It is the right \\r\\nstrategy. General Petraeus literally wrote the book on counter insurgency. He is \\r\\na determined, resourceful, and bold commander. Our troops, many of whom have \\r\\nserved multiple tours in Iraq, are performing with great skill and bravery. But \\r\\nthe hour is late and, despite the developments I just described, we should have \\r\\nno illusion that success is certain. But having been a critic of the way this \\r\\nwar was fought and a proponent of the very strategy now being followed, it\\'s my \\r\\nobligation to encourage Americans to give it a chance to succeed. To do \\r\\notherwise would be contrary to the interests of my country and dishonorable. Many in Washington \\r\\nhave called for an end to our involvement in Iraq. Yet they offer no opinion \\r\\nabout the consequences of this course of action beyond a vague assurance that \\r\\nall will be well if the Iraqis are left to work out their differences \\r\\nthemselves. It is obviously true that no military solution is capable of doing \\r\\nwhat the Iraqis won\\'t do politically. But, my friends, no political solution has \\r\\na chance to succeed when al Qaeda is free to foment civil war and Iraqis remain \\r\\ndependent on sectarian militias to protect their children from being murdered. America -- America has a vital \\r\\ninterest in preventing the emergence of Iraq as a Wild West for terrorists, \\r\\nsimilar to Afghanistan before 9/11. By leaving Iraq before there is a stable \\r\\nIraqi governing authority we risk precisely this, and the potential consequence \\r\\nof allowing terrorists sanctuary in Iraq is another 9/11 or worse. In Iraq \\r\\ntoday, terrorists have resorted to levels of barbarism that shock the world, and \\r\\nwe should not be so naive as to believe their intentions are limited solely to \\r\\nthe borders of that country. We Americans are their primary enemy, and we \\r\\nAmericans are their ultimate target. A power vacuum in Iraq \\r\\nwould invite further interference from Iran at a time when Tehran already \\r\\nfalsely emboldened -- feels \\r\\nemboldened enough to develop nuclear weapons, threaten Israel and America, and \\r\\nkidnap British sailors. If the government collapses in Iraq, which it surely \\r\\nwill if we leave prematurely, Iraq\\'s neighbors, from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, \\r\\nSyria, Turkey, and Egypt, will feel pressure to intervene on the side of their \\r\\nfavored factions. This uncertain swirl of events could cause the region to \\r\\nexplode and foreclose the opportunity for millions of Muslims and their children \\r\\nto achieve freedom. We could face a terrible choice, a terrible choice: watch the region burn, the \\r\\nprice of oil escalate dramatically and our economy decline, watch the terrorists \\r\\nestablish new base camps or send American troops back to Iraq, with the odds \\r\\nagainst our success much worse than they are today. To enumerate the \\r\\nstrategic interests at stake in Iraq does not address our moral obligation to a \\r\\npeople we liberated from Saddam Hussein\\'s tyranny. I suspect many in this \\r\\naudience, and most members of Congress, look back at America\\'s failure to act to \\r\\nprevent genocide in Rwanda with shame. I know I do. But I fear the potential \\r\\nfor genocide and ethnic cleansing in Iraq is even worse. The sectarian violence, \\r\\nthe social divisions, the armaments, the weakened security apparatus of the \\r\\nstate -- all the ingredients are there. Unless we fight to prevent it, our \\r\\nwithdrawal will be coupled with a genocide in which we are complicit. Given our \\r\\nsecurity interests and our moral investment in Iraq, so long as we have a chance \\r\\nto prevail we must try to prevail. As General Petraeus has repeatedly stated, it \\r\\nwill be several months or more before we know with any confidence whether we can \\r\\nturn this war around. Elements in the new civil-military strategy are still \\r\\nbeing drafted, almost half the additional troops have yet to arrive, and many \\r\\nof the new civilians have yet to take up their posts. We are off to a good \\r\\nstart, but significant results will take time. What struck me upon my \\r\\nreturn from Baghdad is the enormous gulf between the harsh but hopeful realities \\r\\nin Iraq, where politics is for many a matter of life and death, and the fanciful \\r\\nand self-interested debates about Iraq that substitutes for statesmanship in \\r\\nWashington. In Iraq, American and Iraqi soldiers risk everything to hold the \\r\\ncountry together, to prevent it from becoming a terrorist sanctuary and the \\r\\nregion from descending into the dangerous chaos of a widening war. In \\r\\nWashington, where political calculation seems to trump all other considerations, \\r\\nDemocrats in Congress and their leading candidates for President, heedless of \\r\\nthe terrible consequences of our failure, unanimously confirmed our new \\r\\ncommander, and then insisted he be prevented from taking the action he believes \\r\\nnecessary to safeguard our country\\'s interests. In Iraq, hope is a fragile \\r\\nthing, but all the more admirable for the courage and sacrifice necessary to \\r\\nnurture it. In Washington, cynicism appears to be the quality most prized by \\r\\nthose who accept defeat but not the responsibility for its consequences. Before I left for \\r\\nIraq, I watched with regret as the House of Representatives voted to deny our \\r\\ntroops the support necessary to carry out their new mission. Democratic leaders \\r\\nsmiled and cheered as the last votes were counted. What were they celebrating? \\r\\nDefeat? Surrender? In Iraq, only our enemies were cheering. A defeat for the \\r\\nUnited States is a cause for mourning not celebrating. And determining how the \\r\\nUnited States can avert such a disaster should encourage the most sober, \\r\\npublic-spirited reasoning among our elected leaders -- not the giddy anticipation \\r\\nof the next election. Democrats who voted to authorize this war, and criticized \\r\\nthe failed strategy that has led us to this perilous moment, have the same \\r\\nresponsibility I do: to offer support when that failure is recognized and the \\r\\nright strategy is proposed and the right commanders take the field to implement \\r\\nit or, at the least, to offer an alternative strategy that has some relationship \\r\\nto reality. Democrats argue we \\r\\nshould redirect American resources to the \"real\" war on terror, of which Iraq is \\r\\njust a sideshow. But whether or not al Qaeda terrorists were a present danger in \\r\\nIraq before the war, there is no disputing they are there now, and their leaders \\r\\nrecognize Iraq as the main battleground in the war on terror. Today, al Qaeda \\r\\nterrorists are the ones preparing the car bombs, firing the Katyusha rockets, \\r\\nplanting the IEDs. They maneuver in the midst of Iraq\\'s sectarian conflict, \\r\\nsparking and fueling the horrendous violence, destroying efforts at political \\r\\nreconciliation, killing innocents on both sides in the hope of creating a \\r\\nconflagration that will cause Americans to lose heart and leave, so they can \\r\\nreturn to their primary mission: planning and executing attacks on the United \\r\\nStates, and destabilizing America\\'s allies. It is impossible to \\r\\nseparate sectarian violence from the war against al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is following \\r\\nan explicit strategy to foment civil war in Iraq. The only way to reduce and \\r\\nfinally end sectarian violence is to provide greater security to the population \\r\\nthan we have in the past, as we are doing now in Baghdad; to encourage Iraqis to \\r\\nabandon their reliance on local militias, and to destroy al Qaeda and other \\r\\ntruly irreconcilable enemies of the United States and the Iraqi people. Our defeat in Iraq \\r\\nwould constitute a defeat in the war against terror and extremism that would make \\r\\nthe world a much more dangerous place. The enemies we face there harbor the same \\r\\ndepraved indifference to human life as those who killed three thousand innocent \\r\\nAmericans on a September morning in 2001. A couple of days before I arrived in \\r\\nBaghdad, a suicide car bomb destroyed a large, busy marketplace. It was a bit \\r\\nunusual, because now -- new U.S. and Iraqi security measures in Baghdad have reduced \\r\\nthe number of car bomb attacks. But this time the terrorists had a new tactic: \\r\\nthey drove their car to a security checkpoint and were waved through because \\r\\nthere were two small children in the back seat. The terrorists then walked away \\r\\nfrom the car, leaving the children inside it, and triggered the explosion. If \\r\\nthe terrorists are willing to do this terrible thing to Iraqi children, what are \\r\\nthey willing to do to our children? Some argue the war in \\r\\nIraq no longer has anything to do with us; that it is a hopelessly complicated \\r\\nmess of tribal warfare and sectarian conflict. The situation is complex, and \\r\\nvery difficult. Yet from one perspective it is quite simple. We are engaged in a \\r\\nbasic struggle, a struggle between humanity and inhumanity, between builders and \\r\\ndestroyers. If fighting these people and preventing the export of their brand of \\r\\nradicalism and terror is not intrinsic to the national security and most \\r\\ncherished values of the United States, I don\\'t know what is. Consider our other \\r\\nstrategic challenges in the region: preventing Iran from going nuclear; \\r\\nstabilizing Afghanistan against a resurgent Taliban; the battle for the future \\r\\nof Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others; protecting Israel\\'s security; the \\r\\nstruggle for Lebanon\\'s independence. Does any honest observer believe those \\r\\nchallenges will be easier to confront and at lesser cost in American blood and \\r\\ntreasure if the United States accepts defeat in Iraq? We all agree a \\r\\nmilitary solution alone will not solve the problems of Iraq. There must be a \\r\\npolitical agreement among Iraqis that allows all groups to participate in the \\r\\nbuilding of their nation, to share in its resources and to live in peace with \\r\\none aother. But without greater security imposed by the United States military \\r\\nand the Iraqi Army, there can be no political solution. As Americans and Iraqis \\r\\nsacrifice to provide that security, Iraq\\'s leaders must do the hard work of \\r\\npolitical reconciliation. We can help them get there, but we cannot assume their \\r\\nresponsibilities. Unless they accept their own obligations to all Iraqis, we \\r\\nwill all fail, and America, Iraq, and the world will have to live with the \\r\\nterrible consequences. We are giving Iraq\\'s leaders and people the chance to \\r\\nhave a better future, but they must seize it. In the many mistakes \\r\\nwe have made in this war, a few lessons have become clear. America should never \\r\\nundertake a war unless we are prepared to do everything necessary to succeed, \\r\\nand unless we have a realistic and comprehensive plan for success. We did not \\r\\nmeet this responsibility initially. We\\'re trying to do so now. Responsible \\r\\npolitical leaders, statesmen, do not add to the burdens our troops carry. That \\r\\nis what Democrats, intentionally or not, have done by failing to provide them \\r\\nwith the resources necessary to succeed in their mission. Every day that passes \\r\\nwithout the necessary funds appropriated to sustain our troops, our chances of \\r\\nsuccess in Iraq dwindle and our military readiness declines further. We have \\r\\nsent the best Americans among us to fight in Iraq, and at least, at least we must give \\r\\nthem the tools they need to do their job. When the President vetoes, as he \\r\\nshould, the bill that refuses to support General Petraeus\\'s new plan, I hope \\r\\nDemocrats in Congress will heed the advice of one of their leading candidates \\r\\nfor President, Senator Obama, and immediately pass a new bill to provide support \\r\\nto our troops in Iraq without -- without substituting their partisan interests for those of \\r\\nour troops and our country. I know the pain war \\r\\ncauses. I understand the frustration caused by our mistakes in this war. I \\r\\nsympathize with the fatigue of the American people. And I regret sincerely the \\r\\nadditional sacrifices imposed on the brave Americans who defend us. But I also \\r\\nknow the toll a lost war takes on an army and a country. We, who are willing to \\r\\nsupport this new strategy, and give General Petraeus the time and support he \\r\\nneeds, have chosen a hard road. But it is the right road. It is necessary and \\r\\njust. Democrats, who deny our soldiers the means to prevent an American defeat, \\r\\nhave chosen another road. It may appear to be the easier course of action, but \\r\\nit is a much more reckless one, and it does them no credit even if it gives them \\r\\nan advantage in the next election. This is an historic choice, with \\r\\nthe ramifications for Americans not even born yet. Let\\'s put aside for a moment the \\r\\nsmall politics of the day. The judgment of history should be the approval we \\r\\nseek, not the temporary favor of the latest public opinion poll. We all respect the \\r\\nsacrifices made by our soldiers. We all mourn the losses they have suffered in \\r\\nthis war. But let us honor them by doing all we can to ensure their sacrifices \\r\\nwere not made in vain. Let us show an appropriate humility by recognizing that \\r\\nso little is asked of us compared to the burdens we imposed on them, and let us \\r\\nshow just a small, but significant measure of their courage, resolve and \\r\\npatriotism by putting our country\\'s interests before every personal or political \\r\\nconsideration. In closing, I\\'d like \\r\\nto bring to your attention the gallantry and patriotism of one American who \\r\\nserved with distinction in Iraq, aNavy SEAL, who refuses to quit his mission \\r\\nand let the country he loves so well suffer the terrible harm our defeat would \\r\\nentail. Just a few days ago, Petty Officer First Class Mark Robbins\\' unit was \\r\\nambushed outside Baghdad. During the ensuing firefight, he spotted an insurgent \\r\\nwith an RPG, and immediately stepped out from cover and exposed himself to enemy \\r\\nfire to take out the terrorists before he could fire. He saved the lives of his \\r\\ncomrades, but was gravely wounded as he did so. He was shot in the eye by \\r\\nanother insurgent with an AK-47. The bullet exited the back of his head about \\r\\nthree inches behind his ear. He was initially knocked unconscious but came to, \\r\\ncontinued to fight and then, despite the severity of his wound, walked to the \\r\\nevacuation helicopter. He was eventually taken to Landstuhl military hospital in \\r\\nGermany. As is the custom of Navy SEALs, he was accompanied by one of his \\r\\ncomrades, Petty Officer Second class McLean Swink. On our way home from \\r\\nIraq, our delegation stopped in Germany for refueling and crew rest, and I had \\r\\nthe privilege of visiting some of our wounded at Landstuhl. I briefly stopped in \\r\\nMark Robbins\\' room, but he was sedated and unable then to communicate. I spent a \\r\\nfew moments there, and talked to his buddy, before I went to visit other wounded \\r\\nsoldiers. Not too long after I had left Mark\\'s room, Petty Officer Swink found \\r\\nme and told me Mark was awake and had asked to see me. So I returned. When I \\r\\nentered his room and approached his bedside, he struggled with great difficulty \\r\\nto sit up, stiffened his body as if he were trying to stand at attention, \\r\\ngrasped my hand tightly and wouldn\\'t let go. And then he whispered to me not to \\r\\nworry, \"We can win this fight. We can win this fight.\" Mark, as another person \\r\\nobserved, looks like the \"toughest kid on the high school football team.\" He\\'s \\r\\ntough and brave and very young. But more than that, he\\'s an inspiration to \\r\\nthose who are only called upon to subordinate a temporary political advantage to \\r\\nthe security of our good and great nation. Petty Officer Mark Robbins, an \\r\\nAmerican hero, believes we can still win this fight. I\\'ll take his word for it, \\r\\nand accept my responsibility to help the cause he sacrificed so much to defend. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'When Franklin Roosevelt died in 1945, theNew \\r\\nYork Timeswrote, \"Men will thank God \\r\\n[in their knees] a hundred years from now that Franklin D. \\r\\nRoosevelt was in the White House.\" It will not take \\r\\na hundred years \\r\\nto thank God for Ronald Reagan. But why? Why was he so admired? Why was he so \\r\\nbeloved? He was beloved, first, \\r\\nbecause of what he was. Politics can be cruel, uncivil. Our friend was strong \\r\\nand gentle. Once he calledAmerica \"hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent and fair.\" That was America and, \\r\\nyes, our friend. And next, Ronald Reagan was \\r\\nbeloved because what he believed. He believed in America, so he made it his \\r\\nshining city on a hill. He believed in freedom, so he acted on behalf of its \\r\\nvalues and ideals. He believed in tomorrow, so The Great Communicator became The \\r\\nGreat Liberator.  He talked of winning one \\r\\n\"for the Gipper\" and as \\r\\nPresident, through his relationship withMikhail \\r\\nGorbachev, with us today, the Gipper and, yes, Mikhail Gorbachevwon one for \\r\\npeace around the world. If Ronald Reagan created a \\r\\nbetter world for many millions it was because of the world someone else created \\r\\nfor him. Nancy was there for him \\r\\nalways. Her love for him provided much of his strength, and their love together \\r\\ntransformed all of us as we\\'ve seen -- renewed seeing again here in the last few \\r\\ndays. And one of the many \\r\\nmemories we all have of both of them is the comfort they provided during our \\r\\nnational tragedies. Whether it was the families \\r\\nof the crew of theChallenger shuttle, or theUSS Stark, or theMarines killed in \\r\\nBeirut, we will never forget those images of the President and First \\r\\nLady \\r\\nembracing them and embracing us during times of sorrow. So, Nancy, I want to say \\r\\nthis to you: Today, America embraces you. We open up our arms. We seek to \\r\\ncomfort you, to tell you of our admiration for your courage and your selfless \\r\\ncaring. And to the Reagan kids \\r\\n-- \\r\\nit\\'s okay for me to say that at 80 --Michael,Ron,Patti, today all of our \\r\\nsympathy, all of our condolences to you all. And remember, too, your sisterMaureen, home safe now with her father. As his Vice President for \\r\\neight years, I learned more from Ronald Reagan than from anyone I encountered in \\r\\nall my years of public life. I learned kindness; we all did. I also learned \\r\\ncourage; the nation did. Who can forget the horrible \\r\\nday inMarch 1981, he looked at the doctors in the emergency room and said, \"I \\r\\nhope you\\'re all Republicans.\"1  And then I learned decency; \\r\\nthe whole world did. Days after being shot, weak from wounds, he spilled water \\r\\nfrom a sink, and entering the hospital -- hospital room, aides saw him on his hands and knees \\r\\nwiping water from the floor. He worried that his nurse would get in trouble. The \\r\\nbook -- Good Book says, \"humility \\r\\ngoes before honor.\"2And our friend had both, and who could not cherish such a \\r\\nman? And perhaps as important as \\r\\nanything, I learned about -- a lot about humor, a lot about laughter. And, oh, how \\r\\nPresident Reagan loved a good story. When asked, \"How did your \\r\\nvisit go with Bishop Tutu?,\" he replied, \"So-so.\" It was typical. It was \\r\\nwonderful. And in leaving \\r\\n-- in leaving the White \\r\\nHouse, the very last day, he left in the yard outside the Oval Office door a \\r\\nlittle sign for the squirrels. He loved to feed those squirrels. And he left \\r\\nthis sign that said, \"Beware of the dog,\" and to no avail, because our dogMilliecame in and beat the heck out of the squirrels. But anyway, he also left me \\r\\na note, at the top of which said, \"Don\\'t let the turkeys get you down.\" Well, he certainly never \\r\\nlet [them] get him down. And he fought hard for his beliefs. But he led from \\r\\nconviction, but never made an adversary into an enemy. He was never \\r\\nmean-spirited. Reverend Billy Graham, who \\r\\nI refer to as the nation\\'s pastor, is now hospitalized and regrets that he can\\'t \\r\\nbe here today. And I asked him for a Bible passage that might be appropriate. \\r\\nAnd he suggested this from Psalm 37: \"The Lord delights in the way of the man \\r\\nwhose steps he has made firm. Though he stumble, he will not fall for the Lord \\r\\nupholds him with his hand.\" And then this, too, from \\r\\n[Psalm] 37: \"There is a future for the man of peace.\" God bless you, Ronald \\r\\nWilson Reagan and the nation you loved and led so well.

       " 'I can just hear Muhammad saying now, \"Well, I \\tthought I should be eulogized by at least one President. And by \\tmaking you last in a long, long, long, long line I guaranteed \\tyou a standing ovation.\" I\\'m trying to think of what has been left \\tunsaid. First, Lonnie, I thank you and the members of \\tthe family for telling me that he actually -- as Bryant [Gumbel] said -- \\tpicked us all to speak and giving me a chance to come here.\\xa0 \\tI thank you for what you did to make the second half of his life \\tgreater than the first. I think you for theMuhammad \\tAli Centerand what it has come to represent to so many people. Here\\'s what I\\'d like to say.\\xa0 I\\'ve spent a \\tlot of time now, as I get older and older and older, trying to \\tfigure out what makes people tick. How do they turn out the way \\tthey are? How do some people refuse to become victims and rise \\tfrom every defeat.  We\\'ve all seen the beautiful pictures of the \\thome Muhammad Ali was a boy in, and people visiting and driving \\tby. I think he decided something I hope every young \\tperson here will decide. I think he decided very young to write \\this own life story. I think he decided before he could \\tpossibly have worked it all out, and before fate and time could \\twork their will on him, he decided that he would not be ever \\tdisempowered. He decided that not his race, nor his place, \\tnot the expectations of others -- positive, negative, or \\totherwise -- would strip from him the power to write his own \\tstory. He decided first to use these stunning gifts \\t-- his \\tstrength and speed in the ring, his wit and way with words in \\tmanaging the public, and his mind and heart -- to figure out at a \\tfairly young age who he was, what he believed, and how to live \\twith the consequences of acting on what he believed. A lot of \\tpeople make it two steps one and two and still just can\\'t quite \\tmanage living with the consequences of what he believes. For the \\tlongest time, in spite of all the wonderful things that have been \\tsaid here, I remember thinking when I was a kid -- this guy is so \\tsmart. And he never got credit for being as smart as he was. And \\tthen, I don\\'t think he ever got the credit for being, until later, \\tas wise as he was. In the end, besides being a lot of fun to be \\taround and basically a universal soldier for our common humanity, I \\twill always think of Muhammad as a truly free man of faith; and \\tbeing a man of faith, he realized he would never be in full \\tcontrol of his life. Something like Parkinson\\'s could come along, \\tbut being free he realized that life still was open to \\tchoices. It is the choices that Muhammad Ali made that have \\tbrought us all here today in honor and love. And the only \\tother thing I\\'d like to say I think we all need to really, really \\tthink about. The first part of his life was dominated \\tby the triumph of his truly unique gifts. We should never forget \\tthem. We should never stop looking at the movies [of/about him]. We should thank \\tWill Smith for makinghis movie. We should all be thrilled \\t-- it was a thing of beauty. But the second part of his life was more \\timportant because he refused to be imprisoned by a disease that \\tkept him hamstrung longer than Nelson Mandela was kept in prison in \\tSouth Africa. That is, in the second half of his life, \\the perfected gifts that we all have. Every single \\tsolitary one of us have [sic] gifts of mind and heart. It\\'s just that he \\tfound a way to release them -- in ways large and small. I\\'ll never forget, I asked Lonnie \\tif she remembered a time when they were still living in Michigan \\tand I gave a speech in Southwest Michigan. There\\'san \\teconomic club thereand it\\'s sort of a ritual when a President \\tleaves office -- you have to get reacclimated; nobody playsa songwhen you walk \\tin a room anymore; you don\\x92t really know what you\\x92re supposed to \\tdo. And this club, there, it\\x92s called the Economic Club, I think. \\tThey\\x92re used to acting like you still deserve to be listened to \\tand you got to get reacclimated. So they came to \\tdinner and they sat with me at this dinner. And he knew, somehow \\the knew that I was a little off my feet that night. I was trying \\tto imagine how to make this new life, and so he told me a really \\tbad joke. And he told it so well and he laughed so hard that I \\ttotally got over it and had a great time. He had that feel \\t-- you know there\\x92s no textbook for that, knowing where \\tsomebody else is in their head, picking up the body language. Then, Lonnie and Muhammad got me to come here when we had \\tthe dedication of the Muhammad Ali Center, and I was trying to be \\tincredibly old, gray haired, elderly statesman, dignified. I\\'ve got to elevate \\tthis guy -- so I\\x92m saying all this stuff in very high toned \\tlanguage and Muhammad sneaks up behind me and puts his fingers up \\t[behind my head.] Finally, after all the years that \\twe\\'d been friends, my enduring image of him is like a little \\treel in three shots: [1] the boxer I thrilled to as a boy; [2] the man I \\twatched take the last steps to light the Olympic Flame when I \\twas President. And I\\x92ll never forget it. I was sitting there in \\tAtlanta. By then we knew each other. By then I felt I had \\tsome sense of what he was living with. And I was still weeping \\tlike a baby, seeing his hands shake and his legs shake and \\tknowing by God he was going to make those last few steps. No matter \\twhat it took, the flame would be lit; the fight would be won; the \\tspirit would be affirmed. I knew it would happen. And then this [3]: the children whose lives he touched; \\tthe young people he \\tinspired. It\\x92s the most important thing of all. So I ask you to remember that. We \\tall have an Ali story. It\\x92s the gifts we all have that should be \\tmost honored today, because he released them to the world, never \\twasting a day -- that the rest of us could see anyway -- feeling \\tsorry for himself that he had Parkinson\\'s. Knowing that more \\tthan three decades of his life would be circumscribed in ways \\tthat would be chilling to the naked eye, but with a free \\tspirit, it made his life bigger not smaller; because other \\tpeople, all of us unlettered, unschooled, in the unleashing said, \\t\"Well would you look at that look at that. Look at that. [He] may not be able to run \\tacross the ring anymore, may not be able to dodge everybody and \\texhaust everybody anymore, and he\\'s bigger than ever, because \\the is a free man of faith, sharing the gifts we all have. We \\tshould honor him by letting our gifts go among the world as he \\tdid. God bless you, my friend. Go in \\tpeace.',\n",
       " \"Out of the agony and travail of economic America the Committee for\\r\\nIndustrial Organization was born. To millions of Americans exploited without stint by\\r\\ncorporate industry and socially debased beyond the understanding of the fortunate, its\\r\\ncoming was as welcomed as the dawn to the night watcher. To a lesser group of Americans,\\r\\ninfinitely more fortunately situated, blessed with larger quantities of the world\\x92s\\r\\ngoods and insolent in their assumption of privilege, its coming was heralded as a\\r\\nharbinger of ill, sinister of purpose, of unclean methods and non-virtuous objectives. But\\r\\nthe Committee for Industrial Organizations is here. It is now henceforth a definite\\r\\ninstrumentality, destined greatly to influence the lives of our people and the internal\\r\\nand external course of the republic. This is true only because the purposes and objectives of the\\r\\nCommittee for Industrial Organization find economic, social, political and moral\\r\\njustification in the hearts of the millions who are its members and the millions more who\\r\\nsupport it. The organization and constant onward sweep of this movement exemplifies the\\r\\nresentment of the many toward the selfishness, greed and the neglect of the few. The workers of the nation were tired of waiting for corporate\\r\\nindustry to right their economic wrongs, to alleviate their social agony and to grant them\\r\\ntheir political rights. Despairing of fair treatment, they resolved to do something for\\r\\nthemselves. They, therefore, have organized a new labor movement, conceived within the\\r\\nprinciples of the national bill of rights and committed to the proposition that the\\r\\nworkers are free to assemble in their own forums, voice their own grievances, declare\\r\\ntheir own hopes and contract on even terms with modern industry for the sale of their only\\r\\nmaterial possession -- their labor. The Committee for Industrial Organization has a numerical enrollment\\r\\nof 3,718,000 members. It has 32 affiliated national and international unions. Of this\\r\\nnumber 11 unions account for 2,765,000 members. This group is organized in the textile,\\r\\nauto, garment, lumber, rubber, electrical manufacturing, power, steel, coal and transport\\r\\nindustries. The remaining membership exists in the maritime, oil production and refining,\\r\\nship building, leather, chemical, retail, meat packing, vegetable canning, metalliferous\\r\\nmining, miscellaneous manufacturing, agricultural labor, and service and miscellaneous\\r\\nindustries. Some 200,000 workers are organized into 507 chartered local unions not yet\\r\\nattached to a national industrial union. This record bespeaks progress. It is a development without precedent\\r\\nin our own country. Some of this work was accomplished with the enlightened cooperation or\\r\\nthe tolerant acquiescence of employers who recognized that a new labor movement was being\\r\\nforged and who were not disposed, in any event, to flout the law of the land. On the other\\r\\nhand, much of this progress was made in the face of violent and deadly opposition which\\r\\nreached its climax in the slaughter of workers paralleling the massacres of Ludlow and\\r\\nHomestead. In the steel industry the corporations generally have accepted\\r\\ncollective bargaining and negotiated wage agreements with the Committee for Industrial\\r\\nOrganization. Eighty-five per cent of the industry is thus under contract and a peaceful\\r\\nrelationship exits between the management and the workers. Written wage contracts have\\r\\nbeen negotiated with 399 steel companies covering 510,000 men. One thousand thirty-one\\r\\nlocal lodges in 700 communities have been organized. Five of the corporations in the steel industry elected to resist\\r\\ncollective bargaining and undertook to destroy the steel workers' union. These companies\\r\\nfilled their plants with industrial spies, assembled depots of guns and gas bombs,\\r\\nestablished barricades, controlled their communities with armed thugs, leased the police\\r\\npower of cities and mobilized the military power of a state to guard them against the\\r\\nintrusion of collective bargaining within their plants. During this strike 18 steel workers were either shot to death or had\\r\\ntheir brains clubbed out by police, or armed thugs in the pay of the steel companies. In\\r\\nChicago, Mayor Kelly's police force was successful in killing ten strikers before they\\r\\ncould escape the fury of the police, shooting eight of them in the back. One hundred sixty\\r\\nstrikers were maimed and injured by police clubs, riot guns and gas bombs and were\\r\\nhospitalized. Hundreds of strikers were arrested, jailed, treated with brutality\\r\\nwhile incarcerated and harassed by succeeding litigation. None but strikers were murdered,\\r\\ngassed, injured, jailed or maltreated. No one had to die except the workers who were\\r\\nstanding for the right guaranteed them by the Congress and written in the law. The infamous Governor Davey, of Ohio, successful in the last\\r\\nelection because of his reiterated promises of fair treatment to labor, used the military\\r\\npower of the Commonwealth on the side of the Republican Steel Company and the Youngstown\\r\\nSheet and Tube Company. Nearly half of the staggering military expenditure incident to the\\r\\ncrushing of this strike in Ohio was borne by the federal government through the allocation\\r\\nof financial aid to the military establishment of the state. The steel workers have now buried their dead, while the widows weep\\r\\nand watch their orphaned children become objects of public charity. The murder of these\\r\\nunarmed men has never been publicly rebuked by any authoritative officer of the state or\\r\\nfederal government. Some of them, in extenuation, plead lack of jurisdiction, but murder\\r\\nas a crime against the moral code can always be rebuked without regard to the niceties of\\r\\nlegalistic jurisdiction by those who profess to be the keepers of the public conscience. Shortly after Kelly's police force in Chicago had indulged in their\\r\\nbloody orgy, Kelly came to Washington looking for political patronage. That patronage was\\r\\nforthcoming and Kelly must believe that the killing of the strikers is no liability in\\r\\npartisan politics. Meanwhile, the steel puppet Davey is still Governor of Ohio, but not\\r\\nfor long I think - not for long. The people of Ohio may be relied upon to mete our\\r\\npolitical justice to one who has betrayed his state, outraged the public conscience and\\r\\nbesmirched the public honor. While the men of the steel industry were going through blood and gas\\r\\nin defense of their rights and their homes and their families, elsewhere on the far-flung\\r\\nC.I.O. front the hosts of labor were advancing and intelligent and permanent progress was\\r\\nbeing made. In scores of industries plant after plant and company after company were\\r\\nnegotiating sensible working agreements. The men in the steel industry who sacrificed their all were nor\\r\\nmerely aiding their fellows at home but were adding strength to the cause of their\\r\\ncomrades in all industry. Labor was marching toward the goal of industrial democracy and\\r\\ncontributing constructively toward a more rational arrangement of our domestic economy. Labor does not see industrial strife. It wants peace, but a peace\\r\\nwith justice. In the long struggle for labor\\x92s rights it has been patient and\\r\\nforbearing. Sabotage and destruction syndicalism have had no part in the American labor\\r\\nmovement. Workers have kept faith in American institutions. Most of the conflicts, which\\r\\nhave occurred have been when labor\\x92s right to live has been challenged and denied. If there is to be peace in our industrial life let the employer\\r\\nrecognize his obligation to his employees -- at least to the degree set forth in existing\\r\\nstatutes. Ordinary problems affecting wages, hours, and working conditions, in most\\r\\ninstances, will quickly respond to negotiation in the council room. The United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of\\r\\nManufacturers, and similar groups representing industry and financial interests, are\\r\\nrendering a disservice to the American people in their attempts to frustrate the\\r\\norganization of labor and in their refusal to accept collective bargaining as one of our\\r\\neconomic institutions. These groups are encouraging a systematic organization of vigilante\\r\\ngroups to fight unionization under the sham pretext of local interests. They equip these\\r\\nvigilantes with tin hats, wooden clubs, gas masks and lethal weapons and train them in the\\r\\narts of brutality and oppression. They bring in snoops, finks, hatchet gangs and\\r\\nChowderhead Cohens to infest their plants and disturb the communities. Fascist organizations have been launched and financed under the\\r\\nshabby pretext that the C.I.O. movement is communistic. The real breeders of discontent\\r\\nand alien doctrines of government and philosophies subversive of good citizenship are such\\r\\nas these who take the law into their own hands. No tin-hat brigade of goose-stepping vigilantes or bibble-babbling\\r\\nmob of blackguarding and corporation paid scoundrels will prevent the onward march of\\r\\nlabor, or divert its purpose to play its natural and rational part in the development of\\r\\nthe economic, political and social life of our nation. Unionization, as opposed to communism, presupposes the relation of\\r\\nemployment; it is based upon the wage system and it recognizes fully and unreservedly the\\r\\ninstitution of private property and the right to investment profit. It is upon the fuller\\r\\ndevelopment of collective bargaining, the wider expansion of the labor movement, the\\r\\nincreased influence of labor in our national councils, that the perpetuity of our\\r\\ndemocratic institutions must largely depend. The organized workers of America, free in their industrial life,\\r\\nconscious partners in production, secure in their homes and enjoying a decent standard of\\r\\nliving, will prove the finest bulwark against the intrusion of alien doctrines of\\r\\ngovernment. Do those who have hatched this foolish cry of communism in the\\r\\nC.I.O. fear the increased influence of labor in our democracy? Do they fear its influence\\r\\nwill be cast on the side of shorter hours, a better system of distributed employment,\\r\\nbetter homes for the under-privileged, social security for the aged, a fairer distribution\\r\\nof the national income? Certainly the workers that are being organized want a voice in the\\r\\ndetermination of these objectives of social justice. Certainly labor wants a fairer share\\r\\nin the national income. Assuredly labor wants a larger participation in increased\\r\\nproductive efficiency. Obviously the population is entitled to participate in the fruits\\r\\nof the genius of our men of achievement in the field of the material sciences. Labor has suffered just as our farm population has suffered from a\\r\\nviciously unequal distribution of the national income. In the exploitation of both classes\\r\\nof workers has been the source of panic and depression, and upon the economic welfare of\\r\\nboth rests the best assurance of a sound and permanent prosperity. In this connection let me call attention to the propaganda which\\r\\nsome of our industrialists are carrying on among the farmers. By pamphlets in the milk\\r\\ncans or attached to machinery and in countless other ways of direct and indirect approach,\\r\\nthe farmers of the nation are being told that the increased price of farm machinery and\\r\\nfarm supplies is due to the rising wage level brought about by the Committee for\\r\\nIndustrial Organization. And yet it is the industrial millions of this country who\\r\\nconstitute the substantial market for all agricultural products. The interest of the two groups are mutually dependent. It is when\\r\\nthe pay roll goes down that the farmer's realization is diminished, so that his loans\\r\\nbecome overdue at the bank and the arrival of the tax collector is awaited with fear. On\\r\\nthe other hand it is the prosperity of the farmer that quickness the tempo of\\r\\nmanufacturing activities and brings buying power to the millions of urban and industrial\\r\\nworkers. As we view the years that have passed this has always been true and\\r\\nit becomes increasingly imperative that the farm population and the millions of workers in\\r\\nindustry must learn to combine their strength for the attainment of mutual and desirable\\r\\nobjectives and at the same time learn to guard themselves against the sinister propaganda\\r\\nof those who would divide and exploit them. Under the banner of the Committee for Industrial Organization\\r\\nAmerican labor is on the march. Its objectives today are those it had in the beginning: to\\r\\nstrive for the unionization of our unorganized millions of workers and for the acceptance\\r\\nof collective bargaining as a recognized American institution. It seeks peace with the industrial world. It seeks cooperation and\\r\\nmutuality of effort with the agricultural population. It would avoid strikes. It would\\r\\nhave its rights determined under the law by the peaceful negotiations and contract\\r\\nrelationships that are supposed to characterize American commercial life. Until an aroused public opinion demands that employers accept that\\r\\nrule, labor has no recourse but to surrender its rights or struggle for their realization\\r\\nwith its own economic power. The objectives of this movement are not political in a partisan\\r\\nsense. Yet it is true that a political party which seeks the support of labor and makes\\r\\npledges of good faith to labor must, in equity and good conscience, keep that faith and\\r\\nredeem those pledges. The spectacle of august and dignified members of Congress, servants\\r\\nof the people and agents of the republic, skulking in hallways and closets, hiding their\\r\\nfaces in a party caucus to prevent a quorum from acting upon a labor measure, is one that\\r\\nemphasizes the perfidy of politicians and blasts the confidence of labor's millions in\\r\\npolitician's promises and statesmen's vows. Labor next year cannot avoid the necessity of a political assay of\\r\\nthe work and. deeds of its so-called friends and its political beneficiaries. It must\\r\\ndetermine who are its friends in the arena of politics as elsewhere. It feels that its\\r\\ncause is just and that its friends should not view its struggle with neutral detachment or\\r\\nintone constant criticism of its activities. Those who chant their praises of democracy but who lose no chance to\\r\\ndrive their knives into labor's defenseless back must feel the weight of labor's woe even\\r\\nas its open adversaries must ever feel the thrust of labor's power. Labor, like Israel, has many sorrows. Its women weep for their\\r\\nfallen and they lament for the future of the children of the race. It ill behooves one who\\r\\nhas supped at labor's table and who has been sheltered in labor's house to curse with\\r\\nequal fervor and fine impartiality both labor and its adversaries when they become locked\\r\\nin deadly embrace. I repeat that labor seeks peace and guarantees its own loyalty, but\\r\\nthe voice of labor, insistent upon its rights, should not be annoying to the ears of\\r\\njustice or offensive to the conscience of the American people.\",\n",
       " \"Hello, everyone, and welcome to the White House. I'm thrilled to be here with \\r\\n\\t\\tall of you as we celebrateNational Mentoring Month. Mentors have played \\r\\n\\t\\tan incredibly important role in my life and in the President's life. That's why last November, the women, we started a leadership and \\r\\n\\t\\tmentoring program here at the White House for some of the most promising \\r\\n\\t\\tstudents in Washington, D.C. And that's why today we're so happy to \\r\\n\\t\\twelcome a new group of mentors and mentees here with us today, and I \\r\\n\\t\\thope you're as excited about this program as we are.\\xa0Are you?\\xa0Can I \\r\\n\\t\\thear a little excitement? That's it. I want to start by thanking \\r\\n\\t\\teveryone for joining us today from all across the country, both the old \\r\\n\\t\\tfolks and the young folks.\\xa0And some of the young people here have been \\r\\n\\t\\twith their mentors for a while now, I understand.\\xa0And some of you are \\r\\n\\t\\tmeeting your mentors for the first time today. For those of you starting \\r\\n\\t\\tout today, we are honored to be able to pair you with some incredibly \\r\\n\\t\\ttalented people who help run our government and help the President do \\r\\n\\t\\this job each and every day.\\xa0All of your mentors are taking time out of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir busy schedules -- and they are busy these days -- because they \\r\\n\\t\\twant to hear from you. This is sincere. People are doing this because \\r\\n\\t\\tthey want to be a part of your lives, they want to hear about your hopes \\r\\n\\t\\tand dreams and your passions and your struggles. They are here because \\r\\n\\t\\tthey believe in your potential and they want to share some of the \\r\\n\\t\\tlessons that they've learned along the way, because even though they \\r\\n\\t\\tmight look a little old -- remember that these men were standing in your \\r\\n\\t\\tshoes not too long ago. These are the kind of \\r\\n\\t\\trelationships we've been building with our young women over the past few \\r\\n\\t\\tmonths, and the leadership mentoring program is one of the most exciting \\r\\n\\t\\tprograms, and I'm so proud of the work that we've done. And with our \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung girls over this -- these past few months, we've studied the history and \\r\\n\\t\\tprotocol that go into hosting a state dinner. They were with us during \\r\\n\\t\\tthe first state dinner. We've gotten a behind-the-scenes look at events \\r\\n\\t\\there at the White House and around D.C. Many of them have accompanied \\r\\n\\t\\tme in my motorcade and they've spent time with me at events. We've done our own share of \\r\\n\\t\\tservice.\\xa0We packed bags of food for folks in need. And we've learned a \\r\\n\\t\\tlot about the dos and don'ts of applying for a job and starting a \\r\\n\\t\\tcareer, because we want this experience to be very practical for the \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung girls as well. And we've had a lot of fun \\r\\n\\t\\tso far, and we've gotten to do much more than we thought. It's been \\r\\n\\t\\tjust a terrific time. But the biggest lesson our \\r\\n\\t\\tgirls have learned and the one I hope you all learn as you embark on \\r\\n\\t\\tthis program is that each of us has the ability to move beyond the \\r\\n\\t\\tcircumstances that we were born into. That's really the story of both \\r\\n\\t\\tme and the President, that through hard work and perseverance, that you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan actually choose the life that you want to live -- it's your choice. So I hope that each of you \\r\\n\\t\\twill take full advantage of this opportunity, and by taking full \\r\\n\\t\\tadvantage that means once you get over the initial shock of being here \\r\\n\\t\\t-- that you ask questions, that you really take time to get to know your \\r\\n\\t\\tmentors; don't wait for them to ask you -- find out every single thing \\r\\n\\t\\tabout them -- their families, their education, their challenges, their \\r\\n\\t\\tstruggles. Get to know them, and also in the process realize your own \\r\\n\\t\\tpotential. The only thing that we ask \\r\\n\\t\\tin return, and we said this to the girls, is that when this is all over, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat you give back, that you do the same for someone else. That's the \\r\\n\\t\\tonly thing we ask of you -- because the beauty of being a mentor is that \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone can do it at any age. So that means if there's a sibling in your \\r\\n\\t\\tlife, a friend, a cousin, another person down the road, you can thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyour own mentor for turning around and helping pull someone else up. You \\r\\n\\t\\tcan do that by doing the same. Think about that right now. Not just today but in every aspect of your life, that's a commitment \\r\\n\\t\\tthat both the President and I have made, that no matter how far we climb \\r\\n\\t\\twe're always looking back to figure out who we can pull up along the \\r\\n\\t\\tway. And it's never too soon for each of you. So thank you all so much for \\r\\n\\t\\tcoming. We are proud of all of you, not just the mentees but the \\r\\n\\t\\tmentors, for the work that you're doing. And now I have one final \\r\\n\\t\\thonor, and that is to introduce one of our star mentees: the Little \\r\\n\\t\\tBrother of the Year,Anthony Saldaña. Let's give him a warm [welcome]. AnthonySaldaña  Being \\r\\n\\t\\ta part ofBig Brothers Big Sistershas been one of the best experiences \\r\\n\\t\\tof my life. This program means that in addition to my grandma and \\r\\n\\t\\tgrandpa, I get to spend time with a wonderful guy like Ben [De Leon], who is on \\r\\n\\t\\tstage here today. I'm so glad that President Obama supports mentoring \\r\\n\\t\\tprograms so that more kids like me can have a mentor. So I'm honored to \\r\\n\\t\\tintroduce the President of the United States, Barack Obama, a strong \\r\\n\\t\\tsupporter of mentoring and a role model for lots of young people like \\r\\n\\t\\tme.\",\n",
       " 'First of all let me say good after...good late afternoon. Because of the -- theHIV virusthat \\r\\nI have attained, I will have to retire from the Lakers. Today. I just want to make clear, first of \\r\\nall, thatI do not have the AIDS disease-- \\'cause I know a lot of you are -- \\r\\nwant to know that -- but the HIV virus. My wife is fine. She\\'s negative, so \\r\\nthere\\'s no problem with her. I plan on going on, living for a \\r\\nlong time, bugging you guys, like I\\'ve [sic] always have. So, you\\'ll see me \\r\\naround. I plan on being with the Lakers and the league -- Hopefully, David \\r\\n[Stern] will have me for awhile -- and going on with my life. And I guess now I get to enjoy some \\r\\nof the other sides of living...that because of the season, the long practices \\r\\nand so on. I just want to say that I\\'m going to miss playing. And I will now \\r\\nbecome a spokesman for the HIV virus because I want people -- young people to \\r\\nrealize that they can practice safe sex. And you know sometimes you\\'re a little \\r\\nnaive about it and you think it could never happen to you. You only thought it \\r\\ncould happen to, you know, other people and so on and all. And it has happened, \\r\\nbut I\\'m going to deal with it and my life will go on. And I will be here, \\r\\nenjoying the Laker games, and all the other NBA games around the country. So, \\r\\nlife is going to go on for me, and I\\'m going to be a happy man. Now, medical questions that you \\r\\nhave, you have to direct them to Dr.[Michael] Mellmanand he can answer all \\r\\nthose questions for you. Anything concerning the Lakers and so on, we haveJerry \\r\\nWesthere, I\\'m sure. Of course the league -- our commissioner who I \\r\\nwant to thank. I want to thank everybody up here, as well as my teammates, \\r\\nbecause they\\'ve been behind me all the way. I want to thankKareem [Abdul Jabbar]for coming \\r\\nout, him and \"Coop\" [Michael \\r\\nCooper] who -- who stood side by side and won a lot of battles.Larry \\r\\nDrew, another good friend of mine who I played with. But the Commissioner, David Stern, \\r\\nhas been great in supporting me. And I will go on and hopefully work with the \\r\\nleague and help in any way that I can. I want to thank also Jerry West for all \\r\\nhe\\'s done. Dr. Kerr [phonetic]. Dr. Mellman -- he will tell you who my \\r\\nother doctors are that have helped me through this -- as well as, like I said, \\r\\nmy father, in a sense,Dr. Jerry Buss,for just drafting me and me being here. Now, of course, I will miss the \\r\\nbattles and the wars, and I will miss you guys [the reporters]. But life goes \\r\\non. Now, any other questions \\r\\nmedical-wise, you can ask, like I said, Dr. Mellman; anything with the \\r\\nLakers, Jerry West -- or anything with the league. I\\'ll take a few questions \\r\\nabout myself and my plans. [Audio Q&A not transcribed]',\n",
       " ' Before I explain why this speech was so disappointing to millions of \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraelis, I want to say that Israel is deeply grateful to the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates of America, to successive American administrations, to the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican Congress, to the American people. We\\x92re grateful for the \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport Israel has received over many, many decades. Our alliance is \\r\\n\\t\\tbased on shared values, shared interests, a sense of shared destiny, and \\r\\n\\t\\ta partnership that has endured differences of opinions between our two \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments over the best way to advance peace and stability in the \\r\\n\\t\\tMiddle East. I have no doubt that our alliance will endure the profound \\r\\n\\t\\tdisagreement we have had with the Obama Administration and will become \\r\\n\\t\\teven stronger in the future. But now I must express my deep disappointment with the speech today of \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn Kerry -- a speech that was almost as unbalanced as theanti-Israel \\r\\n\\t\\tresolution passed at the UNlast week. In a speech ostensibly about \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace between Israelis and Palestinians, Secretary Kerry paid lip \\r\\n\\t\\tservice to the unremitting campaign of terrorism that has been waged by \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Palestinians against the Jewish state for nearly a century.\\r\\n\\t\\tWhat he did was to spend most of his speech blaming Israel for the lack \\r\\n\\t\\tof peace by passionately condemning a policy of enabling Jews to live in \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir historic homeland and in their eternal capital, Jerusalem. Hundreds of suicide bombings, thousands, tens of thousands of rockets, \\r\\n\\t\\tmillions of Israelis in bomb shelters are not throwaway lines in a \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech. They\\x92re the realities that the people of Israel had to endure \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause of mistaken policies, policies that at the time won the \\r\\n\\t\\tthunderous applause of the world. I don\\x92t seek applause; I seek the \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity, and peace, and prosperity, and the future of the Jewish state.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe Jewish people have sought their place under the sun for 3,000 years, \\r\\n\\t\\tand we\\x92re not about to be swayed by mistaken policies that have caused \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat, great damage. Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by \\r\\n\\t\\tforeign leaders. Israel\\x92s hand has been extended in peace to its \\r\\n\\t\\tneighbors from day one, from its very first day. We\\x92ve prayed for peace; \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92ve worked for it every day since then. And thousands of Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our country and \\r\\n\\t\\tadvance peace.\\r\\n\\t\\tMy family has been one of them; there are many, many others. No one wants peace more than the people of Israel. Israel remains \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitted to resolving the outstanding differences between us and the \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians through direct negotiations. This is how we made peace with \\r\\n\\t\\tEgypt; this is how we made peace with Jordan; it\\x92s the only way we\\x92ll \\r\\n\\t\\tmake peace with the Palestinians. That has always been Israel\\x92s policy; \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has always been America\\x92s policy. Here\\x92s whatPresident Obama himself said at the UN in 2011. He said: Peace is hard work. Peace will not come through statements and \\r\\n\\t\\tresolutions at the United Nations -- if it were that easy, it would have \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen accomplished by now. That\\x92s what President Obama said, and he was right. John Kerry\\'s Two-State Solution Speech And until last week, \\r\\n\\t\\tthis was repeated over and over again as American policy. Secretary \\r\\n\\t\\tKerry said that the United States cannot vote against its own policy. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut that\\x92s exactly what it did at the UN, and that\\x92s why Israel opposed \\r\\n\\t\\tlast week\\x92s Security Council resolution, because it effectively calls \\r\\n\\t\\ttheWestern Wall\"occupied Palestinian Territory,\" because it encourages \\r\\n\\t\\tboycotts and sanctions against Israel. That\\x92s what it effectively does. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd because it reflects a radical shift in U.S. policy towards the \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians on final status issues, those issues that we always \\r\\n\\t\\tagreed, the U.S. and Israel, have to be negotiated directly, face-to-face \\r\\n\\t\\twithout preconditions. That shift happened despite the Palestinians walking away from peace and \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom peace offers time and time again, despite their refusal to even \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiate peace for the past eight years, and despite thePalestinian \\r\\n\\t\\tAuthorityinculcating a culture of hatred towards Israel in an entire \\r\\n\\t\\tgeneration of young Palestinians. Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to mitigate the \\r\\n\\t\\tdamage that this resolution has done, and ultimately to repeal it. Israel hopes that the outgoing Obama Administration will prevent any \\r\\n\\t\\tmore damage being done to Israel at the UN in its waning days. I wish I \\r\\n\\t\\tcould be comforted by the promise that the U.S. says we will not bring any \\r\\n\\t\\tmore resolutions to the UN. That\\x92s what they said about the previous \\r\\n\\t\\tresolution. We have it on absolutely incontestable evidence that the United States \\r\\n\\t\\torganized, advanced, and brought this resolution to the United Nations \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council. We\\x92ll share that information with the incoming \\r\\n\\t\\tAdministration. Some of it is sensitive; it\\x92s all true. You saw some of \\r\\n\\t\\tit in the protocol released in an Egyptian paper. There\\x92s plenty more; \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s the tip of the iceberg. So they say, \"but we didn\\x92t bring it.\" And they could take John Kerry\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech with the six points. It could be raised in the French \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational conference a few days from now and then brought to the UN. \\r\\n\\t\\tSo France will bring it, or Sweden -- not a noted friend of Israel -- \\r\\n\\t\\tcould bring it. And the United States could say, \"Well, we can\\x92t vote \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst our own policy -- we\\x92ve just enunciated it.\" I think the United States, if it\\x92s true to its word, or at least if it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tnow true to its word, should now come out and say, \"We will not allow any \\r\\n\\t\\tresolutions, any more resolutions in the Security Council on Israel. \\r\\n\\t\\tPeriod.\" Not, \"We will bring\" or \"not bring\" -- \"We will not allow any \\r\\n\\t\\t[further resolutions....]\", and stop this game, the charades. I think that the decisions that are vital to Israel\\x92s interests and the \\r\\n\\t\\tfuture of its children, they won\\x92t be made through speeches in \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington or votes in the United Nations or conferences in Paris. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey\\x92ll be made by the Government of Israel around the negotiating \\r\\n\\t\\ttable, making them on behalf of the one and only Jewish state -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tsovereign nation that is the master of its own fate. And one final thought. I personally know the pain, the loss, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsuffering of war. That\\x92s why I\\x92m so committed to peace. Because for \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone who\\x92s experienced it, as I have, war and terror are horrible. I \\r\\n\\t\\twant young Palestinian children to be educated like our children, for \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace. But they\\x92re not educated for peace. The Palestinian Authority \\r\\n\\t\\teducates them to lionize terrorists and to murder Israelis. My vision is that Israelis and Palestinians both have a future of mutual \\r\\n\\t\\trecognition, of dignity, mutual respect, co-existence. But the \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian Authority tells them that they will never accept, and should \\r\\n\\t\\tnever accept, the existence of a Jewish state. So I ask you: How can you make peace with someone who rejects your very \\r\\n\\t\\texistence?\\r\\n\\t\\tSee, this conflict is not about houses, or communities in the West Bank, \\r\\n\\t\\tJudea, Samaria, the Gaza district, or anywhere else. This conflict is, \\r\\n\\t\\tand has always been, about Israel\\x92s very right to exist. That\\x92s why my \\r\\n\\t\\thundreds of calls to sit withPresident Abbasfor peace talks have gone \\r\\n\\t\\tunanswered.  That\\x92s whymy invitation to him to come to the Knesset1was \\r\\n\\t\\tnever answered. That\\x92s why the Palestinian government continues to pay \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone who murders Israelis a monthly salary.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize a Jewish state remains \\r\\n\\t\\tthe core of the conflict; and its removal is the key to peace. Palestinian rejection of Israel and support for terror are what the \\r\\n\\t\\tnations of the world should focus on if they truly want to advance \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace. And I can only express my regret and say that it\\x92s a shame that \\r\\n\\t\\tSecretary Kerry does not see this simple truth. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much, Alberto, for not only that kind introduction but your and your colleagues\\x92 leadership of this important institution. It\\x92s a pleasure to be here at the Newseum. TheNewseumis a monument to some of our most precious freedoms, and I\\x92m grateful for this opportunity to discuss how those freedoms apply to the challenges of the 21st century.Although I can\\x92t see all of you because in settings like this, the lights are in my eyes and you are in the dark, I know that there are many friends and former colleagues. I wish to acknowledge Charles Overby, the CEO of Freedom Forum here at the Newseum; Senator Edward Kaufman and Senator Joe Lieberman, my former colleagues in the Senate, both of whom worked for passage of the Voice Act, which speaks to Congress\\x92s and the American people\\x92s commitment to internet freedom, a commitment that crosses party lines and branches of government.Also, I\\x92m told here as well are Senator Sam Brownback, Senator Ted Kaufman, Representative Loretta Sanchez, many representatives of the Diplomatic Corps, ambassadors, chargés, participants in our International Visitor Leadership Program on internet freedom from China, Colombia, Iran, and Lebanon, and Moldova. And I also want to acknowledge Walter Isaacson, president of the Aspen Institute, recently named to our Broadcasting Board of Governors and, of course, instrumental in supporting the work on internet freedom that the Aspen Institute has been doing.This is an important speech on a very important subject. But before I begin, I want to just speak briefly about Haiti, because during the last eight days, the people of Haiti and the people of the world have joined together to deal with a tragedy of staggering proportions. Our hemisphere has seen its share of hardship, but there are few precedents for the situation we\\x92re facing in Port-au-Prince. Communication networks have played a critical role in our response. They were, of course, decimated and in many places totally destroyed. And in the hours after the quake, we worked with partners in the private sector; first, to set up the text \\x93HAITI\\x94 campaign so that mobile phone users in the United States could donate to relief efforts via text messages. That initiative has been a showcase for the generosity of the American people, and thus far, it\\x92s raised over $25 million for recovery efforts.Information networks have also played a critical role on the ground. When I was with President Preval in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, one of his top priorities was to try to get communication up and going. The government couldn\\x92t talk to each other, what was left of it, and NGOs, our civilian leadership, our military leadership were severely impacted. The technology community has set up interactive maps to help us identify needs and target resources. And on Monday, a seven-year-old girl and two women were pulled from the rubble of a collapsed supermarket by an American search-and-rescue team after they sent a text message calling for help. Now, these examples are manifestations of a much broader phenomenon.The spread of information networks is forming a new nervous system for our planet. When something happens in Haiti or Hunan, the rest of us learn about it in real time \\x96 from real people. And we can respond in real time as well. Americans eager to help in the aftermath of a disaster and the girl trapped in the supermarket are connected in ways that were not even imagined a year ago, even a generation ago. That same principle applies to almost all of humanity today. As we sit here, any of you \\x96 or maybe more likely, any of our children \\x96 can take out the tools that many carry every day and transmit this discussion to billions across the world.Now, in many respects, information has never been so free. There are more ways to spread more ideas to more people than at any moment in history. And even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable.During his visit to China in November, for example, President Obama held a town hall meeting with an online component to highlight the importance of the internet. In response to a question that was sent in over the internet, he defended the right of people to freely access information, and said that the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become. He spoke about how access to information helps citizens hold their own governments accountable, generates new ideas, encourages creativity and entrepreneurship. The United States belief in that ground truth is what brings me here today.Because amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent and deny human rights.In the last year, we\\x92ve seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained. One member of this group, Bassem Samir, who is thankfully no longer in prison, is with us today. So while it is clear that the spread of these technologies is transforming our world, it is still unclear how that transformation will affect the human rights and the human welfare of the world\\x92s population.On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United States does. We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. And we recognize that the world\\x92s information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it. Now, this challenge may be new, but our responsibility to help ensure the free exchange of ideas goes back to the birth of our republic. The words of the First Amendment to our Constitution are carved in 50 tons of Tennessee marble on the front of this building. And every generation of Americans has worked to protect the values etched in that stone.Franklin Roosevelt built on these ideas when he delivered his Four Freedoms speech in 1941. Now, at the time, Americans faced a cavalcade of crises and a crisis of confidence. But the vision of a world in which all people enjoyed freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear transcended the troubles of his day. And years later, one of my heroes, Eleanor Roosevelt, worked to have these principles adopted as a cornerstone of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They have provided a lodestar to every succeeding generation, guiding us, galvanizing us, and enabling us to move forward in the face of uncertainty.So as technology hurtles forward, we must think back to that legacy. We need to synchronize our technological progress with our principles. In accepting the Nobel Prize, President Obama spoke about the need to build a world in which peace rests on the inherent rights and dignities of every individual. And in my speech on human rights at Georgetown a few days later, I talked about how we must find ways to make human rights a reality. Today, we find an urgent need to protect these freedoms on the digital frontiers of the 21st century.There are many other networks in the world. Some aid in the movement of people or resources, and some facilitate exchanges between individuals with the same work or interests. But the internet is a network that magnifies the power and potential of all others. And that\\x92s why we believe it\\x92s critical that its users are assured certain basic freedoms. Freedom of expression is first among them. This freedom is no longer defined solely by whether citizens can go into the town square and criticize their government without fear of retribution. Blogs, emails, social networks, and text messages have opened up new forums for exchanging ideas, and created new targets for censorship.As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics. Two months ago, I was in Germany to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The leaders gathered at that ceremony paid tribute to the courageous men and women on the far side of that barrier who made the case against oppression by circulating small pamphlets called samizdat. Now, these leaflets questioned the claims and intentions of dictatorships in the Eastern Bloc and many people paid dearly for distributing them. But their words helped pierce the concrete and concertina wire of the Iron Curtain.The Berlin Wall symbolized a world divided and it defined an entire era. Today, remnants of that wall sit inside this museum where they belong, and the new iconic infrastructure of our age is the internet. Instead of division, it stands for connection. But even as networks spread to nations around the globe, virtual walls are cropping up in place of visible walls. Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their people from accessing portions of the world\\x92s networks. They\\x92ve expunged words, names, and phrases from search engine results. They have violated the privacy of citizens who engage in non-violent political speech. These actions contravene the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which tells us that all people have the right \\x93to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\\x94 With the spread of these restrictive practices, a new information curtain is descending across much of the world. And beyond this partition, viral videos and blog posts are becoming the samizdat of our day.As in the dictatorships of the past, governments are targeting independent thinkers who use these tools. In the demonstrations that followed Iran\\x92s presidential elections, grainy cell phone footage of a young woman\\x92s bloody murder provided a digital indictment of the government\\x92s brutality. We\\x92ve seen reports that when Iranians living overseas posted online criticism of their nation\\x92s leaders, their family members in Iran were singled out for retribution. And despite an intense campaign of government intimidation, brave citizen journalists in Iran continue using technology to show the world and their fellow citizens what is happening inside their country. In speaking out on behalf of their own human rights, the Iranian people have inspired the world. And their courage is redefining how technology is used to spread truth and expose injustice.Now, all societies recognize that free expression has its limits. We do not tolerate those who incite others to violence, such as the agents of al-Qaida who are, at this moment, using the internet to promote the mass murder of innocent people across the world. And hate speech that targets individuals on the basis of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation is reprehensible. It is an unfortunate fact that these issues are both growing challenges that the international community must confront together. And we must also grapple with the issue of anonymous speech. Those who use the internet to recruit terrorists or distribute stolen intellectual property cannot divorce their online actions from their real world identities. But these challenges must not become an excuse for governments to systematically violate the rights and privacy of those who use the internet for peaceful political purposes.The freedom of expression may be the most obvious freedom to face challenges with the spread of new technologies, but it is not the only one. The freedom of worship usually involves the rights of individuals to commune or not commune with their Creator. And that\\x92s one channel of communication that does not rely on technology. But the freedom of worship also speaks to the universal right to come together with those who share your values and vision for humanity. In our history, those gatherings often took place in churches, synagogues, mosques and temples. Today, they may also take place on line.The internet can help bridge divides between people of different faiths. As the President said in Cairo, freedom of religion is central to the ability of people to live together. And as we look for ways to expand dialogue, the internet holds out such tremendous promise. We\\x92ve already begun connecting students in the United States with young people in Muslim communities around the world to discuss global challenges. And we will continue using this tool to foster discussion between individuals from different religious communities.Some nations, however, have co-opted the internet as a tool to target and silence people of faith. Last year, for example, in Saudi Arabia, a man spent months in prison for blogging about Christianity. And a Harvard study found that the Saudi Government blocked many web pages about Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and even Islam. Countries including Vietnam and China employed similar tactics to restrict access to religious information.Now, just as these technologies must not be used to punish peaceful political speech, they must also not be used to persecute or silence religious minorities. Now, prayers will always travel on higher networks. But connection technologies like the internet and social networking sites should enhance individuals\\x92 ability to worship as they see fit, come together with people of their own faith, and learn more about the beliefs of others. We must work to advance the freedom of worship online just as we do in other areas of life.There are, of course, hundreds of millions of people living without the benefits of these technologies. In our world, as I\\x92ve said many times, talent may be distributed universally, but opportunity is not. And we know from long experience that promoting social and economic development in countries where people lack access to knowledge, markets, capital, and opportunity can be frustrating and sometimes futile work. In this context, the internet can serve as a great equalizer. By providing people with access to knowledge and potential markets, networks can create opportunities where none exist.Over the last year, I\\x92ve seen this firsthand in Kenya, where farmers have seen their income grow by as much as 30 percent since they started using mobile banking technology; in Bangladesh, where more than 300,000 people have signed up to learn English on their mobile phones; and in Sub-Saharan Africa, where women entrepreneurs use the internet to get access to microcredit loans and connect themselves to global markets.Now, these examples of progress can be replicated in the lives of the billion people at the bottom of the world\\x92s economic ladder. In many cases, the internet, mobile phones, and other connection technologies can do for economic growth what the Green Revolution did for agriculture. You can now generate significant yields from very modest inputs. And one World Bank study found that in a typical developing country, a 10 percent increase in the penetration rate for mobile phones led to an almost 1 percent increase in per capita GDP. To just put this into context, for India, that would translate into almost $10 billion a year.A connection to global information networks is like an on-ramp to modernity. In the early years of these technologies, many believed that they would divide the world between haves and have-nots. But that hasn\\x92t happened. There are 4 billion cell phones in use today. Many of them are in the hands of market vendors, rickshaw drivers, and others who\\x92ve historically lacked access to education and opportunity. Information networks have become a great leveler, and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want. Now, we have every reason to be hopeful about what people can accomplish when they leverage communication networks and connection technologies to achieve progress. But make no mistake \\x96 some are and will continue to use global information networks for darker purposes. Violent extremists, criminal cartels, sexual predators, and authoritarian governments all seek to exploit these global networks. Just as terrorists have taken advantage of the openness of our societies to carry out their plots, violent extremists use the internet to radicalize and intimidate. As we work to advance freedoms, we must also work against those who use communication networks as tools of disruption and fear.Governments and citizens must have confidence that the networks at the core of their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. Now this is about more than petty hackers who deface websites. Our ability to bank online, use electronic commerce, and safeguard billions of dollars in intellectual property are all at stake if we cannot rely on the security of our information networks.Disruptions in these systems demand a coordinated response by all governments, the private sector, and the international community. We need more tools to help law enforcement agencies cooperate across jurisdictions when criminal hackers and organized crime syndicates attack networks for financial gain. The same is true when social ills such as child pornography and the exploitation of trafficked women and girls online is there for the world to see and for those who exploit these people to make a profit. We applaud efforts such as the Council on Europe\\x92s Convention on Cybercrime that facilitate international cooperation in prosecuting such offenses. And we wish to redouble our efforts.We have taken steps as a government, and as a Department, to find diplomatic solutions to strengthen global cyber security. We have a lot of people in the State Department working on this. They\\x92ve joined together, and we created two years ago an office to coordinate foreign policy in cyberspace. We\\x92ve worked to address this challenge at the UN and in other multilateral forums and to put cyber security on the world\\x92s agenda. And President Obama has just appointed a new national cyberspace policy coordinator who will help us work even more closely to ensure that everyone\\x92s networks stay free, secure, and reliable.States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks. Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation. In an internet-connected world, an attack on one nation\\x92s networks can be an attack on all. And by reinforcing that message, we can create norms of behavior among states and encourage respect for the global networked commons. The final freedom, one that was probably inherent in what both President and Mrs. Roosevelt thought about and wrote about all those years ago, is one that flows from the four I\\x92ve already mentioned: the freedom to connect \\x96 the idea that governments should not prevent people from connecting to the internet, to websites, or to each other. The freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly, only in cyberspace. It allows individuals to get online, come together, and hopefully cooperate. Once you\\x92re on the internet, you don\\x92t need to be a tycoon or a rock star to have a huge impact on society. The largest public response to the terrorist attacks in Mumbai was launched by a 13-year-old boy. He used social networks to organize blood drives and a massive interfaith book of condolence. In Colombia, an unemployed engineer brought together more than 12 million people in 190 cities around the world to demonstrate against the FARC terrorist movement. The protests were the largest antiterrorist demonstrations in history. And in the weeks that followed, the FARC saw more demobilizations and desertions than it had during a decade of military action. And in Mexico, a single email from a private citizen who was fed up with drug-related violence snowballed into huge demonstrations in all of the country\\x92s 32 states. In Mexico City alone, 150,000 people took to the streets in protest. So the internet can help humanity push back against those who promote violence and crime and extremism.In Iran and Moldova and other countries, online organizing has been a critical tool for advancing democracy and enabling citizens to protest suspicious election results. And even in established democracies like the United States, we\\x92ve seen the power of these tools to change history. Some of you may still remember the 2008 presidential election here. (Laughter.) The freedom to connect to these technologies can help transform societies, but it is also critically important to individuals. I was recently moved by the story of a doctor \\x96 and I won\\x92t tell you what country he was from \\x96 who was desperately trying to diagnose his daughter\\x92s rare medical condition. He consulted with two dozen specialists, but he still didn\\x92t have an answer. But he finally identified the condition, and found a cure, by using an internet search engine. That\\x92s one of the reasons why unfettered access to search engine technology is so important in individuals\\x92 lives. Now, the principles I\\x92ve outlined today will guide our approach in addressing the issue of internet freedom and the use of these technologies. And I want to speak about how we apply them in practice. The United States is committed to devoting the diplomatic, economic, and technological resources necessary to advance these freedoms. We are a nation made up of immigrants from every country and every interest that spans the globe. Our foreign policy is premised on the idea that no country more than America stands to benefit when there is cooperation among peoples and states. And no country shoulders a heavier burden when conflict and misunderstanding drive nations apart. So we are well placed to seize the opportunities that come with interconnectivity. And as the birthplace for so many of these technologies, including the internet itself, we have a responsibility to see them used for good. To do that, we need to develop our capacity for what we call, at the State Department, 21st century statecraft. Realigning our policies and our priorities will not be easy. But adjusting to new technology rarely is. When the telegraph was introduced, it was a source of great anxiety for many in the diplomatic community, where the prospect of receiving daily instructions from capitals was not entirely welcome. But just as our diplomats eventually mastered the telegraph, they are doing the same to harness the potential of these new tools as well. And I\\x92m proud that the State Department is already working in more than 40 countries to help individuals silenced by oppressive governments. We are making this issue a priority at the United Nations as well, and we\\x92re including internet freedom as a component in the first resolution we introduced after returning to the United Nations Human Rights Council.We are also supporting the development of new tools that enable citizens to exercise their rights of free expression by circumventing politically motivated censorship. We are providing funds to groups around the world to make sure that those tools get to the people who need them in local languages, and with the training they need to access the internet safely. The United States has been assisting in these efforts for some time, with a focus on implementing these programs as efficiently and effectively as possible. Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom.We want to put these tools in the hands of people who will use them to advance democracy and human rights, to fight climate change and epidemics, to build global support for President Obama\\x92s goal of a world without nuclear weapons, to encourage sustainable economic development that lifts the people at the bottom up.That\\x92s why today I\\x92m announcing that over the next year, we will work with partners in industry, academia, and nongovernmental organizations to establish a standing effort that will harness the power of connection technologies and apply them to our diplomatic goals. By relying on mobile phones, mapping applications, and other new tools, we can empower citizens and leverage our traditional diplomacy. We can address deficiencies in the current market for innovation.Let me give you one example. Let\\x92s say I want to create a mobile phone application that would allow people to rate government ministries, including ours, on their responsiveness and efficiency and also to ferret out and report corruption. The hardware required to make this idea work is already in the hands of billions of potential users. And the software involved would be relatively inexpensive to develop and deploy.If people took advantage of this tool, it would help us target our foreign assistance spending, improve lives, and encourage foreign investment in countries with responsible governments. However, right now, mobile application developers have no financial assistance to pursue that project on their own, and the State Department currently lacks a mechanism to make it happen. But this initiative should help resolve that problem and provide long-term dividends from modest investments in innovation. We\\x92re going to work with experts to find the best structure for this venture, and we\\x92ll need the talent and resources of technology companies and nonprofits in order to get the best results most quickly. So for those of you in the room who have this kind of talent, expertise, please consider yourselves invited to help us.In the meantime, there are companies, individuals, and institutions working on ideas and applications that could already advance our diplomatic and development objectives. And the State Department will be launching an innovation competition to give this work an immediate boost. We\\x92ll be asking Americans to send us their best ideas for applications and technologies that help break down language barriers, overcome illiteracy, connect people to the services and information they need. Microsoft, for example, has already developed a prototype for a digital doctor that could help provide medical care in isolated rural communities. We want to see more ideas like that. And we\\x92ll work with the winners of the competition and provide grants to help build their ideas to scale.Now, these new initiatives will supplement a great deal of important work we\\x92ve already done over this past year. In the service of our diplomatic and diplomacy objectives, I assembled a talented and experienced team to lead our 21st century statecraft efforts. This team has traveled the world helping governments and groups leverage the benefits of connection technologies. They have stood up a Civil Society 2.0 Initiative to help grassroots organizations enter the digital age. They are putting in place a program in Mexico to help combat drug-related violence by allowing people to make untracked reports to reliable sources to avoid having retribution visited against them. They brought mobile banking to Afghanistan and are now pursuing the same effort in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Pakistan, they created the first-ever social mobile network, called Our Voice, that has already produced tens of millions of messages and connected young Pakistanis who want to stand up to violent extremism.In a short span, we have taken significant strides to translate the promise of these technologies into results that make a difference. But there is still so much more to be done. And as we work together with the private sector and foreign governments to deploy the tools of 21st century statecraft, we have to remember our shared responsibility to safeguard the freedoms that I\\x92ve talked about today. We feel strongly that principles like information freedom aren\\x92t just good policy, not just somehow connected to our national values, but they are universal and they\\x92re also good for business.To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers don\\x92t have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.Now, ultimately, this issue isn\\x92t just about information freedom; it is about what kind of world we want and what kind of world we will inhabit. It\\x92s about whether we live on a planet with one internet, one global community, and a common body of knowledge that benefits and unites us all, or a fragmented planet in which access to information and opportunity is dependent on where you live and the whims of censors.Information freedom supports the peace and security that provides a foundation for global progress. Historically, asymmetrical access to information is one of the leading causes of interstate conflict. When we face serious disputes or dangerous incidents, it\\x92s critical that people on both sides of the problem have access to the same set of facts and opinions.As it stands, Americans can consider information presented by foreign governments. We do not block your attempts to communicate with the people in the United States. But citizens in societies that practice censorship lack exposure to outside views. In North Korea, for example, the government has tried to completely isolate its citizens from outside opinions. This lopsided access to information increases both the likelihood of conflict and the probability that small disagreements could escalate. So I hope that responsible governments with an interest in global stability will work with us to address such imbalances.For companies, this issue is about more than claiming the moral high ground. It really comes down to the trust between firms and their customers. Consumers everywhere want to have confidence that the internet companies they rely on will provide comprehensive search results and act as responsible stewards of their own personal information. Firms that earn that confidence of those countries and basically provide that kind of service will prosper in the global marketplace. I really believe that those who lose that confidence of their customers will eventually lose customers. No matter where you live, people want to believe that what they put into the internet is not going to be used against them.And censorship should not be in any way accepted by any company from anywhere. And in America, American companies need to make a principled stand. This needs to be part of our national brand. I\\x92m confident that consumers worldwide will reward companies that follow those principles.Now, we are reinvigorating the Global Internet Freedom Task Force as a forum for addressing threats to internet freedom around the world, and we are urging U.S. media companies to take a proactive role in challenging foreign governments\\x92 demands for censorship and surveillance. The private sector has a shared responsibility to help safeguard free expression. And when their business dealings threaten to undermine this freedom, they need to consider what\\x92s right, not simply what\\x92s a quick profit.We\\x92re also encouraged by the work that\\x92s being done through the Global Network Initiative, a voluntary effort by technology companies who are working with nongovernmental organizations, academic experts, and social investment funds to respond to government requests for censorship. The initiative goes beyond mere statements of principles and establishes mechanisms to promote real accountability and transparency. As part of our commitment to support responsible private sector engagement on information freedom, the State Department will be convening a high-level meeting next month co-chaired by Under Secretaries Robert Hormats and Maria Otero to bring together firms that provide network services for talks about internet freedom, because we want to have a partnership in addressing this 21st century challenge.Now, pursuing the freedoms I\\x92ve talked about today is, I believe, the right thing to do. But I also believe it\\x92s the smart thing to do. By advancing this agenda, we align our principles, our economic goals, and our strategic priorities. We need to work toward a world in which access to networks and information brings people closer together and expands the definition of the global community. Given the magnitude of the challenges we\\x92re facing, we need people around the world to pool their knowledge and creativity to help rebuild the global economy, to protect our environment, to defeat violent extremism, and build a future in which every human being can live up to and realize his or her God-given potential.So let me close by asking you to remember the little girl who was pulled from the rubble on Monday in Port-au-Prince. She\\x92s alive, she was reunited with her family, she will have the chance to grow up because these networks took a voice that was buried and spread it to the world. No nation, no group, no individual should stay buried in the rubble of oppression. We cannot stand by while people are separated from the human family by walls of censorship. And we cannot be silent about these issues simply because we cannot hear the cries.So let us recommit ourselves to this cause. Let us make these technologies a force for real progress the world over. And let us go forward together to champion these freedoms for our time, for our young people who deserve every opportunity we can give them.Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou, Caroline. My fellow Democrats, my \\r\\n\\t\\tfellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here. And nothing -- nothing is \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to keep me away from this special gathering tonight. I have come here tonight to \\r\\n\\t\\tstand with you to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our \\r\\n\\t\\tbest ideals, and to elect Barack Obama President of the United States. As I look ahead, I am \\r\\n\\t\\tstrengthened by family and friendship. So many of you have been with me \\r\\n\\t\\tin the happiest days and the hardest days. Together we have known \\r\\n\\t\\tsuccess and seen setbacks, victory, and defeat. But we have never lost our \\r\\n\\t\\tbelief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI pledge to you -- I pledge to you that I will be there next January on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe floor of the United States Senate when we begin the great test. Thank you very much. Thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. Thank you. For me this is a season of \\r\\n\\t\\thope -- new hope for a justice and fair prosperity for the many, and not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust for the few -- new hope. And this is the cause of my \\r\\n\\t\\tlife -- new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that \\r\\n\\t\\tevery American -- north, south, east, west, young, old -- will have \\r\\n\\t\\tdecent, quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege. We can meet these challenges \\r\\n\\t\\twith Barack Obama. Yes, we can, and finally, yes, we will. Barack Obama will close the \\r\\n\\t\\tbook on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and \\r\\n\\t\\tstraight against gay. And Barack Obama will be a \\r\\n\\t\\tCommander-in-Chief who understands that young Americans in uniform must \\r\\n\\t\\tnever be committed to a mistake, but always to a mission worthy of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir bravery. We are told that Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tObama believes too much in an America of high principle and bold \\r\\n\\t\\tendeavor, but when John Kennedy thought of going to the moon, he didn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tsay, \"It\\'s too far to get there. We shouldn\\'t even try.\" Our people answered his call \\r\\n\\t\\tand rose to the challenge, and today an American flag still marks the \\r\\n\\t\\tsurface of the moon. Yes, we are all Americans. \\r\\n\\t\\tThis is what we do. We reach the moon. We scale the heights. I know it. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve seen it. I\\'ve lived it. And we can do it again. There is a new wave of \\r\\n\\t\\tchange all around us, and if we set our compass true, we will reach our \\r\\n\\t\\tdestination -- not merely victory for our Party, but renewal for our \\r\\n\\t\\tnation. And this Novemberthe torch \\r\\n\\t\\twill be passed again to a new generation of Americans, so with Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tObama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his \\r\\n\\t\\tcause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And thedream lives \\r\\n\\t\\ton.',\n",
       " 'Good afternoon. \\r\\n\\t\\tJoining me to my far left is Jim Vanderberg from the Department of \\r\\n\\t\\tLabor, Office of Inspector General, to his right is Tom Brady head of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Postal Inspection Service here in Chicago, and to my immediate left \\r\\n\\t\\tis Rob Grant, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Chicago, and to my \\r\\n\\t\\tright is Reid Schar, Carrie Hamilton, Chris Niewoehner, Assistant U.S. \\r\\n\\t\\tAttorneys, andLucy Rodriguez[ph] from IRS Criminal Investigation Division and along the wall you \\r\\n\\t\\thaveIrene Lindau[ph] also from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Department of Labor, Silvia Carrier from the Postal Inspectors,Jay Hagstrum \\r\\n\\t\\t[ph], David Bray \\r\\n\\t\\t[ph], andDan Cain from the FBI. And I should note \\r\\n\\t\\tthatVick Aurora \\r\\n\\t\\t[ph]from the FBI -- Vick \\r\\n\\t\\tAurora [ph from IRS, Pat Murphy from the FBI, and Jeff Dupilka \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the Postal Service are not here but key participants. I just want to say \\r\\n\\t\\tthat obviously a short time ago a jury sent a loud and clear message -- \\r\\n\\t\\ta loud and clear message that Governor Blagojevich committed very \\r\\n\\t\\tserious crimes, shaking down a children\\'s hospital, trying to sell a \\r\\n\\t\\tSenate seat, and demanding cash, campaign contributions in advance \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore signing a bill. This is a bittersweet \\r\\n\\t\\tmoment.\\r\\n\\t\\tFive years agoanother jury sent another messagethat corruption in Illinois is -- is not tolerable. Governor \\r\\n\\t\\tBlagojevich did not get that message. It\\'s sad that we\\'re back here in \\r\\n\\t\\tjust five years dealing with corruption again with this verdict. But I understand a \\r\\n\\t\\tshort while ago, the jurors hoped that they sent a message today that \\r\\n\\t\\tcorruption is a serious problem that needs to be addressed and I hope \\r\\n\\t\\tthat that message is heard this time. I say it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tbittersweet because as -- as sad as it is that we\\'re at that point where \\r\\n\\t\\tthis sort of criminal conduct took place in Illinois, we take great hope \\r\\n\\t\\tin the jury system. And we take our hats off to those twelve jurors who \\r\\n\\t\\tput aside their business, went about being jurors listening to eleven \\r\\n\\t\\tdays of the government\\'s testimony and evidence and listened to seven \\r\\n\\t\\tdays of the defendant testifying, heard the arguments, heard the law and \\r\\n\\t\\tthen cloistered themselves in a room and came to a -- a fair and just \\r\\n\\t\\tdeliberation on convicting the defendant on seventeen of the twenty \\r\\n\\t\\tcounts. I want to thank the \\r\\n\\t\\tteam. I really think that people may not appreciate how much hard work \\r\\n\\t\\tgoes in from all the different investigative agencies, from the people \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing the investigation, conducting the wiretaps, monitoring the bugs, \\r\\n\\t\\tand the hard work that the AUSAs and the paralegals in our office who \\r\\n\\t\\tare here today, did a great job and their combined work saw that this \\r\\n\\t\\tcase was put before a jury. We\\'re gratified that \\r\\n\\t\\tthe jury put in the time and effort to give it all a very, very close \\r\\n\\t\\thear and the result is what it is, a verdict that\\'s clearly found that \\r\\n\\t\\tthe defendant was guilty on seventeen of twenty counts. And I think I \\r\\n\\t\\tmisspoke when I meant to introduce Lucy Cruz as Lucy Cruz and I just \\r\\n\\t\\twant to thank the trial team for their hard work. And we\\'ll take \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions. No questions, \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'ll... Sorry, yes...    Question:What \\r\\n\\t\\tdid you learn from the first trial in your presentation in the second \\r\\n\\t\\ttrial? Fitzgerald:Well, I think one of the things that we learned from the first trial and \\r\\n\\t\\tI, when I say we I mean the royal \"we\", the people doing the work behind \\r\\n\\t\\tme along the wall, took to heart whatever comments we heard from the \\r\\n\\t\\tjury. Look, a lot of the \\r\\n\\t\\tcounts were eleven to one, so part of the lesson we had to learn was not \\r\\n\\t\\tto overreact to a hung jury. Hung juries happen all the time in federal \\r\\n\\t\\tcourt. But we did make an effort to simplify things and slim things \\r\\n\\t\\tdown. And I was very proud \\r\\n\\t\\tof the trial team, the lawyers and agents and paralegals sitting in the \\r\\n\\t\\troom and discussing what they thought could be slimmed down and what \\r\\n\\t\\tmade sense to focus more heavily on. And I think the second trial, I \\r\\n\\t\\tthought the first trial was well presented, I think the second trial was \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter presented because we learned from the first trial and made it -- \\r\\n\\t\\tmade it simpler. Question:The \\r\\n\\t\\tFBI made the arrest of Mr. Blagojevich as he was on the cusp of \\r\\n\\t\\tfollowing through with these plans that he was supposedly making to sell \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Senate seat. Why didn\\'t you wait till he actually did it, instead of \\r\\n\\t\\tacting before? Fitzgerald:Two reasons. One should be plain, we don\\'t like to see Senate seats \\r\\n\\t\\tsold. I mean, a United States Senate seat should not be put up for sale. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou shouldn\\'t let the sale happen. And I think we would have kicked \\r\\n\\t\\tourselves and others should have rightly kicked us if we sat around and \\r\\n\\t\\twatched a Senate seat be sold. Our job is to try to prevent crime, not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust to prosecute crime. In addition to that \\r\\n\\t\\tyou may have recall that there was a leak to a newspaper article that \\r\\n\\t\\tindicated Mr. Blagojevich was being recorded on. I think some of the \\r\\n\\t\\tstory was a bit off, but that was involved. But it was clear to us that \\r\\n\\t\\twe needed to step in before a Senate seat was sold and not watch it \\r\\n\\t\\thappen. Question:Some \\r\\n\\t\\tfelt that you were a bit heavy-handed, not you personally but the \\r\\n\\t\\tprosecution was a bit heavy-handed by arresting him in his home, taking \\r\\n\\t\\thim out in handcuffs. So does this give you satisfaction today? Fitzgerald:No, there\\'s no, let\\'s separate the two questions. We\\'re not satisfied by \\r\\n\\t\\ta verdict. We would have been disappointed by a not guilty verdict. I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink the people of Illinois are vindicated by our verdict. When a \\r\\n\\t\\tsitting official, a Governor, tries to sell a Senate seat, tries to \\r\\n\\t\\tshake down a children\\'s hospital, and tries to demand cash before \\r\\n\\t\\tsigning legislation that\\'s sitting on his desk, that\\'s an affront to the \\r\\n\\t\\tcitizens and it\\'s right that the citizens\\' interests are vindicated. That\\'s not a personal \\r\\n\\t\\tjoy, it\\'s bittersweet, but we needed him to see that. It\\'s -- It\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tappropriate in the right cases to make arrests for the right reasons. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll have you notice, you may forget that he was brought into this \\r\\n\\t\\tcourthouse with no one seeing it. He was arrested early in the morning \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause there were reporters outside his house and people got there \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore then. So, it\\'s appropriate which, it\\'s not as if we go around and \\r\\n\\t\\tsaying only people committing certain types of crime are allowed to be \\r\\n\\t\\tarrested. We did it for law enforcement reasons and we did it in a way \\r\\n\\t\\tthat none of you were there to see it. So it wasn\\'t done as any other \\r\\n\\t\\treason then -- then the reason we did it. So I think it\\'s appropriate. Question:Leading to the investigate, into the leak of the, will there be an \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation into the -- the source of the leak? Fitzgerald:And I can\\'t comment on that whether there is or will be such an \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation. Obviously I would not be involved in that investigation \\r\\n\\t\\tsince if -- if there was a leak it was from people who had access to the \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation who may be in or outside government, so I can\\'t comment. Yes? Question:There are a lot of legal commentators and others that said you\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tcriminalizing politics, that the things he did are what politicians do \\r\\n\\t\\tall the time. What\\'s your reaction? Fitzgerald:That couldn\\'t be any further from the truth. Let\\'s think about it. When \\r\\n\\t\\tdo you sell a Senate seat? If you listen to the tapes that were key to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe jury, it was a tape at the end where he\\'s basically saying we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to get tangible political support, something up front. We have to \\r\\n\\t\\tsee it. It was clearly cash. And anyone tells you that it\\'s politics as \\r\\n\\t\\tusual, that you\\'re going to get appointed to a Senate seat because \\r\\n\\t\\tsomeone\\'s going to deliver cash as a campaign contribution, then we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tin a world of hurt. The idea that you\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to go to a children\\'s hospital and say the rates for reimbursing \\r\\n\\t\\tpediatric care are going to increase only if you donate fifty thousand \\r\\n\\t\\tdollars to my campaign, a\\x85 basically a deal. Give me a contribution or \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'ll pull back the rate increase is outrageous. That\\'s not politics as \\r\\n\\t\\tusual. The idea that you \\r\\n\\t\\thave a bill sitting on your desk to benefit the racetrack industry and \\r\\n\\t\\tyou rehearse with someone on tape that they should go out and demand \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the person make a campaign contribution before you sign the bill, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s not politics as usual, that\\'s a crime. And I think it often \\r\\n\\t\\thappens that people take what is criminal conduct and try to mush it \\r\\n\\t\\tinto politics. There is legitimate politics, there are gray areas. \\r\\n\\t\\tSelling a Senate seat, shaking down a children\\'s hospital, and squeezing \\r\\n\\t\\ta person to give money before you sign a bill that benefits them is not \\r\\n\\t\\ta gray area, it\\'s a crime. Yes? Question:[Crosstalk] What kind of{unclear at 7:25}are you seeking? Fitzgerald:The -- The sentencing has not yet been scheduled. Obviously the -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tsentence is up to the judge. The judge will look at the sentencing \\r\\n\\t\\tguidelines. They have not yet been calculated and take into account all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe relevant conduct. As in any other case, we do not want the judge to \\r\\n\\t\\thear our position on sentencing from a TV camera, but he will see our \\r\\n\\t\\tposition on sentencing when we file it in writing at the time of \\r\\n\\t\\tsentencing. Obviously the only thing I will say now is that we view the \\r\\n\\t\\tcharged and convicted conduct as very serious. Yes? Question:Obviously you felt that the, sir obviously you felt that the wiretap \\r\\n\\t\\tevidence was very strong and implicated the Governor in these crimes. \\r\\n\\t\\tWere you concerned at all when he took the stand himself that somehow he \\r\\n\\t\\tmay be able to counter balance those and that might have worked to his \\r\\n\\t\\tadvantage? Fitzgerald:Any person who\\'s involved in any way in a trial is always concerned \\r\\n\\t\\tabout everything that happens in the trial. And there was eleven days of \\r\\n\\t\\ttestimony and tapes and the defendant took the stand for seven days. So \\r\\n\\t\\tas a trial lawyer, people are concerned about what happens but that\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tpart of the process. He had a constitutional right to testify. He did. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe jury saw him testify in detail and I think the result is that they \\r\\n\\t\\trejected his testimony in large part when each of the seventeen counts \\r\\n\\t\\the was convicted of he specifically denied that he engaged in criminal \\r\\n\\t\\tconduct. So, I think that\\'s all I can really say. Question:Would you acknowledge that this case, the{unclear at 8:45},the Ryan verdict is supposed to send a message to get \\r\\n\\t\\tcorruption out of politics in Illinois. Is Rod Blagojevich an apparition \\r\\n\\t\\tor is he symptomatic of a culture of corruption that going to persist in \\r\\n\\t\\tIllinois politics? Fitzgerald:I \\r\\n\\t\\twon\\'t comment on whether there\\'s a culture of corruption, what I will \\r\\n\\t\\tsay is this, that we hope that if anyone out there ever tries to engage \\r\\n\\t\\tin corrupt conduct of that nature, that people come forward. We -- We \\r\\n\\t\\thad the good fortune in having excellent investigators and agents doing \\r\\n\\t\\thard work. We -- We had the good fortune that the agents built the \\r\\n\\t\\tevidence so we can get a wiretap and a bug and capture the crime in, the \\r\\n\\t\\tcrimes in progress. But we hope that the next time that anyone who hears \\r\\n\\t\\tany inkling of such activity would come forward and tell us. And that to \\r\\n\\t\\tme is the key is not to solve corruption by prosecution but solve \\r\\n\\t\\tcorruption by the attitude people have. That people should not expect to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe shaken down. People should be offended by being shaken down and \\r\\n\\t\\tshould come forward and report it to us. Yes? First and then \\r\\n\\t\\tsecond. Question:I \\r\\n\\t\\tfound this trial to be much more understandable and much easier to \\r\\n\\t\\tfollow. I think some of the jurors just told us that they felt that the \\r\\n\\t\\tclosing helped them figure out what happened, to put the pieces \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether. How instrumental is dropping the racketeering charges --{unclear at 9:56} Fitzgerald:The one thing I would note is that we added the racketeering charges \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore the first trial in part because there was uncertainty in the \\r\\n\\t\\tSupreme Court as to where Honest Services fraud stood. During the trial, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat was sorted out in a Supreme Court decision so it made it easier to \\r\\n\\t\\tdrop the cases, drop those counts which were -- Yes? Question:{unclear at 10:19} Fitzgerald:Well, we \\r\\n\\t\\tobviously dropped it to simplify the case in the hope that a simplified \\r\\n\\t\\tcase would be easier to handle. We don\\'t know what would have happened \\r\\n\\t\\tif we tried it again with those items in there, but we\\'re gratified that \\r\\n\\t\\tthe jury found the seventeen counts proven. Yes? Question:{unclear 10:37} Fitzgerald:I \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t know if Reid Schar might be able to handle that better than I? Schar:Sure. What the \\r\\n\\t\\tjudge indicated was in the next seven days the lawyers for each side \\r\\n\\t\\twill sit down and discuss the defendant posting, I believe what\\'s left \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the forfeiture allegations which would be his principle residence \\r\\n\\t\\tand I believe a condominium that he has in Washington D.C. And there \\r\\n\\t\\twill be some paperwork that needs to be filled out in terms of his \\r\\n\\t\\tability to post those things and a forfeiture agreement that he\\'ll sign. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd then those will be securing his bond. Question:Do \\r\\n\\t\\tyou feel any vindication by this...trial? And secondly --{unclear 11:23} Fitzgerald:The vindication is for the people of Illinois. The people of Illinois \\r\\n\\t\\thad a Governor who tried to sell a Senate seat and shake people down and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe reason we went to a retrial was to see those counts tried -- tried \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough to a verdict. And we saw that seventeen of the twenty counts or \\r\\n\\t\\teighteen of the twenty counts reached a verdict, seventeen were guilty \\r\\n\\t\\tand one not guilty and I think that\\'s a vindication for the citizens who \\r\\n\\t\\tshould not have that sort of conduct happen on a watch. Question:Are you \\r\\n\\t\\tsaying when you\\'re talking about people coming forward sooner, was that \\r\\n\\t\\t-- was that a problem with this case?{unclear 12:04} Fitzgerald:I \\r\\n\\t\\twasn\\'t counting on this case. What I was counting on is when -- when{unclear 12:09}asked the question, we had the \\r\\n\\t\\tGovernor Ryan conviction, we had the Governor Blagojevich conviction and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe path forward isn\\'t to have convictions to deal with corruption, it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tto have an attitude for people to be offended by corruption and to be \\r\\n\\t\\tmore aggressive about coming forward. Some people did come forward but I \\r\\n\\t\\twasn\\'t counting on this case. The -- The future of Illinois will be a \\r\\n\\t\\tlot better when -- when people are offended by corruption and come \\r\\n\\t\\tforward with more vigor. Yes sir? Question:Did \\r\\n\\t\\tI -- Did I hear you to say that you, your office is not going to \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigate how the Wyma cooperation was leaked to the Tribune? Fitzgerald:What I said is if there were an investigation we would not handle the \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation. Question:What \\r\\n\\t\\toffice would you handle? Fitzgerald:I...simply said, I wouldn\\'t know. I wouldn\\'t pick the office to \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigate a leak if the leak was involving possibly people in the \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment or outside the government. Question:Do \\r\\n\\t\\tyou believe there should be an investigation? Fitzgerald:I\\'m not going to comment on it, an investigation that\\'s not mine. I \\r\\n\\t\\tnever do that. Question:Could Mr. Grant comment on it? Would the FBI\\x85? Grant:Oh \\r\\n\\t\\tyeah, I\\'ll-- {unclear 13:08} Natasha?[ph] Question:A \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment witness testified that Jesse Jackson was at a table with a \\r\\n\\t\\tfundraiser discussing --{unclear at 13:19}.Why haven\\'t you [said] anything about--{unclear at 13:25} Fitzgerald:And -- And I can\\'t comment on any -- any person\\'s name who came up \\r\\n\\t\\tduring the trial or during any of the testimony other than the \\r\\n\\t\\tdefendant. And you shouldn\\'t read anything into that. If you ask me \\r\\n\\t\\tabout anyone\\'s conduct in this trial other than the defendant, I can\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tcomment on that. Question:Can I just follow \\r\\n\\t\\tup...Operation Board Games....{unclear at 13:42}.Is it continuing? Is it not continuing. Is this-- {unclear at 13:47} Fitzgerald:I \\r\\n\\t\\t-- I would say thatOperation Board Gamesis -- is open as \\r\\n\\t\\twe still have a -- a trial to go but I won\\'t comment beyond that because \\r\\n\\t\\tyou\\'ve twinned it to a question I\\'m not supposed to answer. Question:{unclear at 13:58} Fitzgerald:I\\'m not going to comment on that trial and I\\'m not going to comment on \\r\\n\\t\\t-- on Mr. Blagojevich\\'s intentions, so. Question:{unclear at 14:10} Fitzgerald:He -- He has not yet been sentenced. The sentence has not been scheduled \\r\\n\\t\\tand I\\'m not going to comment on that trial, which is still pending. Question:{unclear \\r\\n\\t\\tat 14:22} Fitzgerald:You were there in the courtroom when the judge wants to hear, see the \\r\\n\\t\\tpost-trial motions and I think he has a status conference set for next \\r\\n\\t\\tmonth some time. And -- And we\\'ll -- we\\'ll hear then. Question:Can you \\r\\n\\t\\tunequivocally say that no one in the U.S. Attorney\\'s office could leak \\r\\n\\t\\tthe recordings --{14:39} Fitzgerald:As \\r\\n\\t\\tto how that story got leaked, the only thing I can unequivocally say is \\r\\n\\t\\tI didn\\'t leak it and if anyone here thought I did let me know. But, you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow seriously I\\x85take leaks seriously. I\\'ve been involved in leak \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigations and if something leaked that\\'s awful. And all I can say \\r\\n\\t\\tis I can\\'t do a leak investigation if information was leaked that I \\r\\n\\t\\tknew. That\\'s inappropriate. So, as a person who can\\'t do the \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation, I can\\'t comment beyond that. If you\\'re asking me \\r\\n\\t\\tunequivocally, I didn\\'t do it and I have confidence, and -- and look you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, there\\'s a story, I haven\\'t read it since December 2008 and what\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tunclear is exactly where the information came from. I think people get \\r\\n\\t\\tconfused in some cases because there are grand jury secrecy rules, so \\r\\n\\t\\tthe government can\\'t leak grand jury information. Witnesses aren\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tleaking grand jury information, they can talk about it, so I\\'m not \\r\\n\\t\\tassuming there\\'s a leak. What I\\'m simply saying is there was a story in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe newspaper that would indicate there was an investigation going on. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhether that came from someone outside the government or inside the \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment, I don\\'t know, but I would not be the person to determine \\r\\n\\t\\tthat. So, I don\\'t want to create the impression that there is an \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation or not or that there was a leak or not, what I\\'m simply \\r\\n\\t\\tsaying is that\\'s not my role to decide and I probably shouldn\\'t have \\r\\n\\t\\tcommented, which has started me down this road, however I did. Question:What \\r\\n\\t\\thappened to the story ofBeard? \\r\\n\\t\\t[ph] He was on tape telling Robert Blagojevich to cancel the meeting \\r\\n\\t\\twithRoger Nyack. [ph] Do you \\r\\n\\t\\tthink that that meeting would have gone ahead if that Tribune story had \\r\\n\\t\\tnot appeared? Fitzgerald:I\\'m not going to speculate on what would have happened under different \\r\\n\\t\\tfacts. We did prove up what did happen which was prior to then. He tried \\r\\n\\t\\t-- tried to sell a Senate seat and was just convicted of it. Question:In \\r\\n\\t\\tyour opinion, I know you\\'re a prosecutor and not a judge but his \\r\\n\\t\\tattorneys have said that they weren\\'t able to get certain evidence \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore, in this trial, that they weren\\'t able to present certain \\r\\n\\t\\twitnesses that they wanted, they weren\\'t able to play certain tapes that \\r\\n\\t\\tthey wanted to have heard. Does that fly? They would like a new trial. \\r\\n\\t\\tIn your opinion do they have a leg to stand on? Fitzgerald:In \\r\\n\\t\\tmy opinion, they\\'re not entitled to a new trial. What I\\'d simply say is \\r\\n\\t\\tthere were lots of tapes played in -- in that courtroom and there\\'s no \\r\\n\\t\\ttape that explains away what was said where he sent someone out to try \\r\\n\\t\\tand collect the cash and said basically, we want to see something up \\r\\n\\t\\tfront, some of the stuff has got to start happening now, talk as if the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld, the whole world is listening, meet in person, don\\'t talk over the \\r\\n\\t\\tphone. There\\'s no mythical \\r\\n\\t\\ttape out there that explains that away. And as far as getting evidence \\r\\n\\t\\tin, we put in eleven days of the government\\'s proof. The defendant took \\r\\n\\t\\tthe stand for seven days. And the defendant presented his story to the \\r\\n\\t\\tjury. It was roundly rejected by and large in each of the seventeen \\r\\n\\t\\tcounts that he was convicted of. So I think it was a fair trial. The \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment put forth its version. He put forth the defendant\\'s version \\r\\n\\t\\tin the most direct way possible. He took the stand. And the jury \\r\\n\\t\\tdecided. Question:Legal observers have said that your reputation is on the line with this \\r\\n\\t\\ttrial. What would you say to that? Fitzgerald:I\\x85 \\r\\n\\t\\tthink what was on the line is the interests of the citizens in being \\r\\n\\t\\tvindicated for people committing a crime. Every case we go into court, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\x85 may have no attention is important to everyone in this building. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s important to the prosecution, the agents. It\\'s important to the \\r\\n\\t\\tdefendant. And you know this gets more attention. But every case we do \\r\\n\\t\\tin drug, gang work, and white collar work, and fraud and mortgage fraud \\r\\n\\t\\tis important. And we\\'ll -- we\\'ll keep proceeding. Question:Mr. Schar mentioned maybe undermining \\r\\n\\t\\tthe trial --{unclear at 18:01}...Is \\r\\n\\t\\tthis no harm no foul or is there ongoing damage from --{unclear at 18:15} Fitzgerald:I\\'m not going to comment, I think we can, you know we will say whatever \\r\\n\\t\\tcomments are appropriate for sentencing for sentencing but I think we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tjust going to focus on today, what the outcome was and the jury\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tverdict. Okay? If there are no further questions Question:What \\r\\n\\t\\t-- What about your future? There\\'s been talk about you, maybe FBI \\r\\n\\t\\tperhaps? Fitzgerald:I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink you missed that story a few -- a few months ago, so. I think \\r\\n\\t\\tDirector Mueller is staying on or -- or that Congress is expecting to \\r\\n\\t\\tpass legislation to keep him on for two years, which I think is great. \\r\\n\\t\\tHe\\'s a terrific Director and the best person to fill his shoes is \\r\\n\\t\\tDirector Mueller, so. Question:How \\r\\n\\t\\tlong do you plan on stay in your job? Fitzgerald:That\\'s it. I think I\\'m just going to go to lunch and thank you all for \\r\\n\\t\\tcoming.',\n",
       " \"Today, I want to share candid thoughts about an issue which for decades \\r\\n\\t\\thas animated the foreign policy dialogue here and around the world -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been deeply committed \\r\\n\\t\\tto Israel and its security, and that commitment has guided his pursuit \\r\\n\\t\\tof peace in the Middle East. This is an issue which, all of you know, I \\r\\n\\t\\thave worked on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple reason: because the two-state solution is the only way to achieve \\r\\n\\t\\ta just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It is the \\r\\n\\t\\tonly way to ensure Israel\\x92s future as a Jewish and democratic state, \\r\\n\\t\\tliving in peace and security with its neighbors. It is the only way to \\r\\n\\t\\tensure a future of freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And \\r\\n\\t\\tit is an important way of advancing United States interests in the \\r\\n\\t\\tregion. Now, I\\x92d like to explain why that future is now in jeopardy, and provide \\r\\n\\t\\tsome context for why we could not, in good conscience, stand in the way \\r\\n\\t\\tof a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides \\r\\n\\t\\tmust act now to preserve the possibility of peace. I\\x92m also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward \\r\\n\\t\\tif the responsible parties are willing to act. And I want to share \\r\\n\\t\\tpractical suggestions for how to preserve and advance the prospects for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe just and lasting peace that both sides deserve. So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed conversation about the \\r\\n\\t\\tuncomfortable truths and difficult choices, because the alternative that \\r\\n\\t\\tis fast becoming the reality on the ground is in nobody\\x92s interest -- not \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region -- and not the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates. Now, I want to stress that there is an important point here: My job, \\r\\n\\t\\tabove all, is to defend the United States of America -- to stand up for \\r\\n\\t\\tand defend our values and our interests in the world. And if we were to \\r\\n\\t\\tstand idly by and know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous \\r\\n\\t\\tdynamic to take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to \\r\\n\\t\\ta region in which we have vital interests, we would be derelict in our \\r\\n\\t\\town responsibilities. Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the \\r\\n\\t\\tU.S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own \\r\\n\\t\\tpositions, our own words, our own principles -- even after urging again \\r\\n\\t\\tand again that the policy must change. Friends need to tell each other \\r\\n\\t\\tthe hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect. Israel\\x92s permanent representative to the United Nations, who does not \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport a two-state solution, said after the vote last week, quote, \\x93It \\r\\n\\t\\twas to be expected that Israel\\x92s greatest ally would act in accordance \\r\\n\\t\\twith the values that we share,\\x94 and veto this resolution. I am compelled \\r\\n\\t\\tto respond today that the United States did, in fact, vote in accordance \\r\\n\\t\\twith our values, just as previous U.S. administrations have done at the \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council before us. They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States of America, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has done more to support Israel than any other country, this friend \\r\\n\\t\\tthat has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel, cannot be \\r\\n\\t\\ttrue to our own values -- or even the stated democratic values of Israel \\r\\n\\t\\t-- and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo-state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes. And that\\x92s the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations was about \\r\\n\\t\\tpreserving the two-state solution. That\\x92s what we were standing up for: \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael\\x92s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace and security with its neighbors. That\\x92s what we are trying to \\r\\n\\t\\tpreserve for our sake and for theirs. In fact, this Administration has been Israel\\x92s greatest friend and \\r\\n\\t\\tsupporter, with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael\\x92s security and protecting its legitimacy. On this point, I want to be very clear: No American administration has \\r\\n\\t\\tdone more for Israel\\x92s security than Barack Obama\\x92s. The Israeli prime \\r\\n\\t\\tminister himself has noted our, quote, \\x93unprecedented\\x94 military and \\r\\n\\t\\tintelligence cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than \\r\\n\\t\\tever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless Israeli lives. We \\r\\n\\t\\thave consistently supported Israel\\x92s right to defend itself, by itself, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding during actions in Gaza that sparked great controversy. Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel\\x92s back. We have \\r\\n\\t\\tstrongly opposed boycotts, divestment campaigns, and sanctions targeting \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael in international fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was \\r\\n\\t\\tattacked, and we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In \\r\\n\\t\\tthe midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly \\r\\n\\t\\tincreased funding to support Israel. In fact, more than one-half of our \\r\\n\\t\\tentire global Foreign Military Financing goes to Israel. And this fall, \\r\\n\\t\\twe concluded an historic $38 billion memorandum of understanding that \\r\\n\\t\\texceeds any military assistance package the United States has provided \\r\\n\\t\\tto any country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge \\r\\n\\t\\tmissile defense and sustain Israel\\x92s qualitative military edge for years \\r\\n\\t\\tto come. That\\x92s the measure of our support. This commitment to Israel\\x92s security is actually very personal for me. \\r\\n\\t\\tOn my first trip to Israel as a young senator in 1986, I was captivated \\r\\n\\t\\tby a special country, one that I immediately admired and soon grew to \\r\\n\\t\\tlove. Over the years, like so many others who are drawn to this \\r\\n\\t\\textraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead Sea, driven \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom one Biblical city to another. I\\x92ve also seen the dark side of \\r\\n\\t\\tHizballah\\x92s rocket storage facilities just across the border in Lebanon, \\r\\n\\t\\twalked through exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, \\r\\n\\t\\tstood on the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny \\r\\n\\t\\tairspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the importance of \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity to Israelis. Out of those experiences came a steadfast \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitment to Israel\\x92s security that has never wavered for a single \\r\\n\\t\\tminute in my 28 years in the Senate or my four years as Secretary. I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I met \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity amidst the \\r\\n\\t\\toccupation, passed by military checkpoints that can make even the most \\r\\n\\t\\troutine daily trips to work or school an ordeal, and heard from business \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders who could not get the permits that they needed to get their \\r\\n\\t\\tproducts to the market and families who have struggled to secure \\r\\n\\t\\tpermission just to travel for needed medical care. And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict that has gone \\r\\n\\t\\ton for far too long. I\\x92ve seen Israeli children in Sderot whose \\r\\n\\t\\tplaygrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets. I\\x92ve visited shelters next \\r\\n\\t\\tto schools in Kiryat Shmona that kids had 15 seconds to get to after a \\r\\n\\t\\twarning siren went off. I\\x92ve also seen the devastation of war in the \\r\\n\\t\\tGaza Strip, where Palestinian girls in Izbet Abed Rabo played in the \\r\\n\\t\\trubble of a bombed-out building. No children -- Israeli or Palestinian -- should have to live like that. So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when I became \\r\\n\\t\\tSecretary of State, I knew that I had to do everything in my power to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp end this conflict. And I was grateful to be working for President \\r\\n\\t\\tObama, who was prepared to take risks for peace and was deeply committed \\r\\n\\t\\tto that effort. Like previous U.S. administrations, we have committed our influence and \\r\\n\\t\\tour resources to trying to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict because, \\r\\n\\t\\tyes, it would serve American interests to stabilize a volatile region \\r\\n\\t\\tand fulfill America\\x92s commitment to the survival, security and \\r\\n\\t\\twell-being of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors. Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now \\r\\n\\t\\tin serious jeopardy. The truth is that trends on the ground -- violence, terrorism, \\r\\n\\t\\tincitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthey are combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and \\r\\n\\t\\tincreasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople do not actually want. Today, there are a number -- there are a similar number of Jews and \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or \\r\\n\\t\\tthey can separate into two states. But here is a fundamental reality: if \\r\\n\\t\\tthe choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic -- it \\r\\n\\t\\tcannot be both -- and it won\\x92t ever really be at peace. Moreover, the \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland \\r\\n\\t\\tof their own with a one-state solution. Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and that is why it \\r\\n\\t\\tis important that polls of Israelis and Palestinians show that there is \\r\\n\\t\\tstill strong support for the two-state solution -- in theory. They just \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t believe that it can happen. After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other side as people, \\r\\n\\t\\tonly as threats and enemies. Both sides continue to push a narrative \\r\\n\\t\\tthat plays to people\\x92s fears and reinforces the worst stereotypes rather \\r\\n\\t\\tthan working to change perceptions and build up belief in the \\r\\n\\t\\tpossibility of peace. And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this conflict extends \\r\\n\\t\\tbeyond Israelis and Palestinians. Allies of both sides are content to \\r\\n\\t\\treinforce this with an us or -- \\x93you\\x92re with us or against us\\x94 mentality \\r\\n\\t\\twhere too often anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is cast \\r\\n\\t\\tas anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic. That\\x92s one of the most striking realties about the current situation: \\r\\n\\t\\tThis critical decision about the future -- one state or two states -- is \\r\\n\\t\\teffectively being made on the ground every single day, despite the \\r\\n\\t\\texpressed opinion of the majority of the people. The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual occupation, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut most of the public either ignores it or has given up hope that \\r\\n\\t\\tanything can be done to change it. And with this passive resignation, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe problem only gets worse, the risks get greater and the choices are \\r\\n\\t\\tnarrowed. This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by the \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians and incitement, \\r\\n\\t\\twhich are destroying belief in the possibility of peace. Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification for terrorism, \\r\\n\\t\\tand there never will be. And the most recent wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds \\r\\n\\t\\tof terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings, shootings, \\r\\n\\t\\tvehicular attacks and bombings, many by individuals who have been \\r\\n\\t\\tradicalized by social media. Yet the murderers of innocents are still \\r\\n\\t\\tglorified on Fatah websites, including showing attackers next to \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian leaders following attacks. And despite statements by \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Abbas and his party\\x92s leaders making clear their opposition to \\r\\n\\t\\tviolence, too often they send a different message by failing to condemn \\r\\n\\t\\tspecific terrorist attacks and naming public squares, streets and \\r\\n\\t\\tschools after terrorists. President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian leadership \\r\\n\\t\\tcountless times, publicly and privately, that all incitement to violence \\r\\n\\t\\tmust stop. We have consistently condemned violence and terrorism, and \\r\\n\\t\\teven condemned the Palestinian leadership for not condemning it. Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to delegitimize \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael in international fora. We have strongly opposed these \\r\\n\\t\\tinitiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and inflammatory \\r\\n\\t\\tUNESCO resolution regarding Jerusalem. And we have made clear our strong \\r\\n\\t\\topposition to Palestinian efforts against Israel at the ICC, which only \\r\\n\\t\\tsets back the prospects for peace. And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a lot more to \\r\\n\\t\\tdo to strengthen its institutions and improve governance. Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an extremist agenda: \\r\\n\\t\\tthey refuse to accept Israel\\x92s very right to exist. They have a \\r\\n\\t\\tone-state vision of their own: all of the land is Palestine. Hamas and \\r\\n\\t\\tother radical factions are responsible for the most explicit forms of \\r\\n\\t\\tincitement to violence, and many of the images that they use are truly \\r\\n\\t\\tappalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel and put the \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople of Gaza at risk in order to advance that agenda. Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbated by the \\r\\n\\t\\tclosings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza is home to one of the world\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tdensest concentrations of people enduring extreme hardships with few \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities. 1.3 million people out of Gaza\\x92s population of 1.8 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion are in need of daily assistance -- food and shelter. Most have \\r\\n\\t\\telectricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the water is \\r\\n\\t\\tsafe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these needs, Hamas and \\r\\n\\t\\tother militant groups continue to re-arm and divert reconstruction \\r\\n\\t\\tmaterials to build tunnels, threatening more attacks on Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilians that no government can tolerate. Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is happening in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe West Bank. The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\thistory, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result \\r\\n\\t\\tis that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself \\r\\n\\t\\tjust described as \\x93more committed to settlements than any in Israel's \\r\\n\\t\\thistory,\\x94 are leading in the opposite direction. They're leading towards \\r\\n\\t\\tone state. In fact, Israel has increasingly consolidated control over \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch of the West Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the \\r\\n\\t\\ttransitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were called for \\r\\n\\t\\tby the Oslo Accords. I don\\x92t think most people in Israel, and certainly in the world, have \\r\\n\\t\\tany idea how broad and systematic the process has become. But the facts \\r\\n\\t\\tspeak for themselves. The number of settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\tsettlements east of the 1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation in the West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has \\r\\n\\t\\tincreased by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since \\r\\n\\t\\t2009, when President Obama's term began. There's no point in pretending that these are just in large settlement \\r\\n\\t\\tblocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of the separation barrier \\r\\n\\t\\tthat was created by Israel itself in the middle of what, by any \\r\\n\\t\\treasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. And the \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation of these distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since \\r\\n\\t\\t2009. In fact, just recently the government approved a significant new \\r\\n\\t\\tsettlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to Israel. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhat does that say to Palestinians in particular -- but also to the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States and the world -- about Israel\\x92s intentions? Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements are the whole \\r\\n\\t\\tor even the primary cause of this conflict. Of course they are not. Nor \\r\\n\\t\\tcan you say that if the settlements were suddenly removed, you\\x92d have \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace. Without a broader agreement, you would not. And we understand \\r\\n\\t\\tthat in a final status agreement, certain settlements would become part \\r\\n\\t\\tof Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over the last \\r\\n\\t\\t49 years -- we understand that -- including the new democratic demographic \\r\\n\\t\\trealities that exist on the ground. They would have to be factored in. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of Palestinian \\r\\n\\t\\tareas, it\\x92s going to be just that much harder to separate, that much \\r\\n\\t\\tharder to imagine transferring sovereignty, and that is exactly the \\r\\n\\t\\toutcome that some are purposefully accelerating. Let\\x92s be clear: Settlement expansion has nothing to do with Israel's \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity. Many settlements actually increase the security burden on the \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraeli Defense Forces. And leaders of the settler movement are \\r\\n\\t\\tmotivated by ideological imperatives that entirely ignore legitimate \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian aspirations. Among the most troubling illustrations of this point has been the \\r\\n\\t\\tproliferation of settler outposts that are illegal under Israel\\x92s own \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws. They\\x92re often located on private Palestinian land and \\r\\n\\t\\tstrategically placed in locations that make two states impossible. There \\r\\n\\t\\tare over 100 of these outposts. And since 2011, nearly one-third of them \\r\\n\\t\\thave been or are being legalized, despite pledges by past Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments to dismantle many of them. Now leaders of the settler movement have advanced unprecedented new \\r\\n\\t\\tlegislation that would legalize most of those outposts. For the first \\r\\n\\t\\ttime, it would apply Israeli domestic law to the West Bank rather than \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary law, which is a major step towards the process of annexation. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhen the law passed the first reading in the Israeli parliament, in the \\r\\n\\t\\tKnesset, one of the chief proponents said proudly -- and I quote -- \\r\\n\\t\\t\\x93Today, the Israeli Knesset moved from heading towards establishing a \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian state towards Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.\\x94 \\r\\n\\t\\tEven the Israeli attorney general has said that the draft law is \\r\\n\\t\\tunconstitutional and a violation of international law. Now, you may hear from advocates that the settlements are not an \\r\\n\\t\\tobstacle to peace because the settlers who don\\x92t want to leave can just \\r\\n\\t\\tstay in Palestine, like the Arab Israelis who live in Israel. But that \\r\\n\\t\\tmisses a critical point, my friends. The Arab Israelis are citizens of \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael, subject to Israel\\x92s law. Does anyone here really believe that \\r\\n\\t\\tthe settlers will agree to submit to Palestinian law in Palestine? Likewise, some supporters of the settlements argue that the settlers \\r\\n\\t\\tcould just stay in their settlements and remain as Israeli citizens in \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir separate enclaves in the middle of Palestine, protected by the IDF. \\r\\n\\t\\tWell, there are over 80 settlements east of the separation barrier, many \\r\\n\\t\\tlocated in places that would make a continuous -- a contiguous \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian state impossible. Does anyone seriously think that if they \\r\\n\\t\\tjust stay where they are you could still have a viable Palestinian \\r\\n\\t\\tstate? Now, some have asked, \\x93Why can\\x92t we build in the blocs which everyone \\r\\n\\t\\tknows will eventually be part of Israel?\\x94 Well, the reason building \\r\\n\\t\\tthere or anywhere else in the West Bank now results in such pushback is \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the decision of what constitutes a bloc is being made unilaterally \\r\\n\\t\\tby the Israeli Government, without consultation, without the consent of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Palestinians, and without granting the Palestinians a reciprocal \\r\\n\\t\\tright to build in what will be, by most accounts, part of Palestine. \\r\\n\\t\\tBottom line -- without agreement or mutuality, the unilateral choices \\r\\n\\t\\tbecome a major point of contention, and that is part of why we are here \\r\\n\\t\\twhere we are. You may hear that these remote settlements aren\\x92t a problem because they \\r\\n\\t\\tonly take up a very small percentage of the land. Well, again and again \\r\\n\\t\\twe have made it clear, it\\x92s not just a question of the overall amount of \\r\\n\\t\\tland available in the West Bank. It\\x92s whether the land can be connected \\r\\n\\t\\tor it\\x92s broken up into small parcels, like a Swiss cheese, that could \\r\\n\\t\\tnever constitute a real state. The more outposts that are built, the \\r\\n\\t\\tmore the settlements expand, the less possible it is to create a \\r\\n\\t\\tcontiguous state. So in the end, a settlement is not just the land that \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s on, it\\x92s also what the location does to the movement of people, \\r\\n\\t\\twhat it does to the ability of a road to connect people, one community \\r\\n\\t\\tto another, what it does to the sense of statehood that is chipped away \\r\\n\\t\\twith each new construction. No one thinking seriously about peace can \\r\\n\\t\\tignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace. But the problem, obviously, goes well beyond settlements. Trends \\r\\n\\t\\tindicate a comprehensive effort to take the West Bank land for Israel \\r\\n\\t\\tand prevent any Palestinian development there. Today, the 60 percent of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe West Bank known as Area C -- much of which was supposed to be \\r\\n\\t\\ttransferred to Palestinian control long ago under the Oslo Accords -- \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch of it is effectively off limits to Palestinian development. Most \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday has essentially been taken for exclusive use by Israel simply by \\r\\n\\t\\tunilaterally designating it as \\x93state land\\x94 or including it within the \\r\\n\\t\\tjurisdiction of regional settlement councils. Israeli farms flourish in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Jordan River Valley, and Israeli resorts line the shores of the Dead \\r\\n\\t\\tSea -- a lot of people don\\x92t realize this -- they line the shore of the \\r\\n\\t\\tDead Sea, where Palestinian development is not allowed. In fact, almost \\r\\n\\t\\tno private Palestinian building is approved in Area C at all. Only one \\r\\n\\t\\tpermit was issued by Israel in all of 2014 and 2015, while approvals for \\r\\n\\t\\thundreds of settlement units were advanced during that same period. Moreover, Palestinian structures in Area C that do not have a permit \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the Israeli military are potentially subject to demolition. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthey are currently being demolished at an historically high rate. Over \\r\\n\\t\\t1,300 Palestinians, including over 600 children, have been displaced by \\r\\n\\t\\tdemolitions in 2016 alone -- more than any previous year. So the settler agenda is defining the future of Israel. And their stated \\r\\n\\t\\tpurpose is clear. They believe in one state: greater Israel. In fact, \\r\\n\\t\\tone prominent minister, who heads a pro-settler party, declared just \\r\\n\\t\\tafter the U.S. election -- and I quote -- \\x93the era of the two-state \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution is over,\\x94 end quote. And many other coalition ministers \\r\\n\\t\\tpublicly reject a Palestinian state. And they are increasingly getting \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir way, with plans for hundreds of new units in East Jerusalem \\r\\n\\t\\trecently announced and talk of a major new settlement building effort in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe West Bank to follow. So why are we so concerned? Why does this matter? Well, ask yourself \\r\\n\\t\\tthese questions: What happens if that agenda succeeds? Where does that \\r\\n\\t\\tlead? There are currently about 2.75 million Palestinians living under \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary occupation in the West Bank, most of them in Areas A and B -- 40 \\r\\n\\t\\tpercent of the West Bank -- where they have limited autonomy. They are \\r\\n\\t\\trestricted in their daily movements by a web of checkpoints and unable \\r\\n\\t\\tto travel into or out of the West Bank without a permit from the \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraelis. So if there is only one state, you would have millions of Palestinians \\r\\n\\t\\tpermanently living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West \\r\\n\\t\\tBank, with no real political rights, separate legal, education, and \\r\\n\\t\\ttransportation systems, vast income disparities, under a permanent \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary occupation that deprives them of the most basic freedoms. \\r\\n\\t\\tSeparate and unequal is what you would have. And nobody can explain how \\r\\n\\t\\tthat works. Would an Israeli accept living that way? Would an American \\r\\n\\t\\taccept living that way? Will the world accept it? If the occupation becomes permanent, over the time the Palestinian \\r\\n\\t\\tAuthority could simply dissolve, turn over all the administrative and \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity responsibilities to the Israelis. What would happen then? Who \\r\\n\\t\\twould administer the schools and hospitals and on what basis? Does \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international \\r\\n\\t\\tassistance that the Palestinian Authority now receives? Would the Israel \\r\\n\\t\\tDefense Force police the streets of every single Palestinian city and \\r\\n\\t\\ttown? How would Israel respond to a growing civil rights movement from \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians, demanding a right to vote, or widespread protests and \\r\\n\\t\\tunrest across the West Bank? How does Israel reconcile a permanent \\r\\n\\t\\toccupation with its democratic ideals? How does the U.S. continue to \\r\\n\\t\\tdefend that and still live up to our own democratic ideals? Nobody has ever provided good answers to those questions because there \\r\\n\\t\\taren\\x92t any. And there would be an increasing risk of more intense \\r\\n\\t\\tviolence between Palestinians and settlers, and complete despair among \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians that would create very fertile ground for extremists. With all the external threats that Israel faces today, which we are very \\r\\n\\t\\tcognizant of and working with them to deal with, does it really want an \\r\\n\\t\\tintensifying conflict in the West Bank? How does that help Israel\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity? How does that help the region? The answer is it doesn\\x92t, which is precisely why so many senior Israeli \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary and intelligence leaders, past and present, believe the \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo-state solution is the only real answer for Israel\\x92s long term \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity. Now, one thing we do know: if Israel goes down the one state path, it \\r\\n\\t\\twill never have true peace with the rest of the Arab world, and I can \\r\\n\\t\\tsay that with certainty. The Arab countries have made clear that they \\r\\n\\t\\twill not make peace with Israel without resolving the \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. That\\x92s not where their loyalties lie. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\x92s not where their politics are. But there is something new here. Common interests in countering Iran\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tdestabilizing activities, and fighting extremists, as well as \\r\\n\\t\\tdiversifying their economies have created real possibilities for \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething different is Israel takes advantage of the opportunities for \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace. I have spent a great deal of time with key Arab leaders exploring \\r\\n\\t\\tthis, and there is no doubt that they are prepared to have a \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamentally different relationship with Israel. That was stated in the \\r\\n\\t\\tArab Peace Initiative, years ago. And in all my recent conversations, \\r\\n\\t\\tArab leaders have confirmed their readiness, in the context of \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraeli-Palestinian peace, not just to normalize relations but to work \\r\\n\\t\\topenly on securing that peace with significant regional security \\r\\n\\t\\tcooperation. It\\x92s waiting. It\\x92s right there. Many have shown a willingness to support serious Israeli-Palestinian \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiations and to take steps on the path to normalization to \\r\\n\\t\\trelations, including public meetings, providing there is a meaningful \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress towards a two-state solution. My friends, that is a real \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity that we should not allow to be missed. And that raises one final question: Is ours the generation that gives up \\r\\n\\t\\ton the dream of a Jewish democratic state of Israel living in peace and \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity with its neighbors? Because that is really what is at stake. Now, that is what informed our vote at the Security Council last week -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthe need to preserve the two-state solution -- and both sides in this \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict must take responsibility to do that. We have repeatedly and \\r\\n\\t\\temphatically stressed to the Palestinians that all incitement to \\r\\n\\t\\tviolence must stop. We have consistently condemned all violence and \\r\\n\\t\\tterrorism, and we have strongly opposed unilateral efforts to \\r\\n\\t\\tdelegitimize Israel in international fora. We\\x92ve made countless public and private exhortations to the Israelis to \\r\\n\\t\\tstop the march of settlements. In literally hundreds of conversations \\r\\n\\t\\twith Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have made clear that continued \\r\\n\\t\\tsettlement activity would only increase pressure for an international \\r\\n\\t\\tresponse. We have all known for some time that the Palestinians were \\r\\n\\t\\tintent on moving forward in the UN with a settlements resolution, and I \\r\\n\\t\\tadvised the prime minister repeatedly that further settlement activity \\r\\n\\t\\tonly invited UN action. Yet the settlement activity just increased, including advancing the \\r\\n\\t\\tunprecedented legislation to legalize settler outposts that the prime \\r\\n\\t\\tminister himself reportedly warned could expose Israel to action at the \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council and even international prosecution before deciding to \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport it. In the end, we could not in good conscience protect the most extreme \\r\\n\\t\\telements of the settler movement as it tries to destroy the two-state \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution. We could not in good conscience turn a blind eye to \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian actions that fan hatred and violence. It is not in U.S. \\r\\n\\t\\tinterest to help anyone on either side create a unitary state. And we \\r\\n\\t\\tmay not be able to stop them, but we cannot be expected to defend them. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd it is certainly not the role of any country to vote against its own \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicies. That is why we decided not to block the UN resolution that makes clear \\r\\n\\t\\tboth sides have to take steps to save the two-state solution while there \\r\\n\\t\\tis still time. And we did not take this decision lightly. The Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tAdministration has always defended Israel against any effort at the UN \\r\\n\\t\\tand any international fora or biased and one-sided resolutions that seek \\r\\n\\t\\tto undermine its legitimacy or security, and that has not changed. It \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\x92t change with this vote. But remember it\\x92s important to note that every United States \\r\\n\\t\\tadministration, Republican and Democratic, has opposed settlements as \\r\\n\\t\\tcontrary to the prospects for peace, and action at the UN Security \\r\\n\\t\\tCouncil is far from unprecedented. In fact, previous administrations of \\r\\n\\t\\tboth political parties have allowed resolutions that were critical of \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael to pass, including on settlements. On dozens of occasions under \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorge W. Bush alone, the council passed six resolutions that Israel \\r\\n\\t\\topposed, including one that endorsed a plan calling for a complete \\r\\n\\t\\tfreeze on settlements, including natural growth. Let me read you the lead paragraph from aNew York Timesstory \\r\\n\\t\\tdated December 23rd. I quote: \\x93With the United States abstaining, the \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council adopted a resolution today strongly deploring Israel\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\thandling of the disturbances in the occupied territories, which the \\r\\n\\t\\tresolution defined as, including Jerusalem. All of the 14 other Security \\r\\n\\t\\tCouncil members voted in favor.\\x94 My friends, that story was not written \\r\\n\\t\\tlast week. It was written December 23rd, 1987, 26 years to the day that \\r\\n\\t\\twe voted last week, when Ronald Reagan was president. Yet despite growing pressure, the Obama Administration held a strong \\r\\n\\t\\tline against UN action, any UN action, we were the only administration \\r\\n\\t\\tsince 1967 that had not allowed any resolution to pass that Israel \\r\\n\\t\\topposed. In fact, the only time in eight years the Obama Administration \\r\\n\\t\\texercised its veto at the United Nations was against a one-sided \\r\\n\\t\\tsettlements resolution in 2011. And that resolution did not mention \\r\\n\\t\\tincitement or violence. Now let\\x92s look at what\\x92s happened since then. Since then, there have \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen over 30,000 settlement units advanced through some stage of the \\r\\n\\t\\tplanning process. That\\x92s right -- over 30,000 settlement units advanced \\r\\n\\t\\tnotwithstanding the positions of the United States and other countries. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd if we had vetoed this resolution just the other day, the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates would have been giving license to further unfettered settlement \\r\\n\\t\\tconstruction that we fundamentally oppose. So we reject the criticism that this vote abandons Israel. On the \\r\\n\\t\\tcontrary, it is not this resolution that is isolating Israel; it is the \\r\\n\\t\\tpermanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace \\r\\n\\t\\timpossible. And virtually every country in the world other than Israel \\r\\n\\t\\topposes settlements. That includes many of the friends of Israel, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding the United Kingdom, France, Russia -- all of whom voted in \\r\\n\\t\\tfavor of the settlements resolution in 2011 that we vetoed, and again \\r\\n\\t\\tthis year along with every other member of the council. In fact, this resolution simply reaffirms statements made by the \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council on the legality of settlements over several decades. It \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes not break new ground. In 1978, the State Department Legal Adviser \\r\\n\\t\\tadvised the Congress on his conclusion that Israel\\x92s government, the \\r\\n\\t\\tIsraeli Government\\x92s program of establishing civilian settlements in the \\r\\n\\t\\toccupied territory is inconsistent with international law, and we see no \\r\\n\\t\\tchange since then to affect that fundamental conclusion. Now, you may have heard that some criticized this resolution for calling \\r\\n\\t\\tEast Jerusalem occupied territory. But to be clear, there was absolutely \\r\\n\\t\\tnothing new in last week\\x92s resolution on that issue. It was one of a \\r\\n\\t\\tlong line of Security Council resolutions that included East Jerusalem \\r\\n\\t\\tas part of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and that includes \\r\\n\\t\\tresolutions passed by the Security Council under President Reagan and \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident George H.W. Bush. And remember that every U.S. administration \\r\\n\\t\\tsince 1967, along with the entire international community, has \\r\\n\\t\\trecognized East Jerusalem as among the territories that Israel occupied \\r\\n\\t\\tin the Six-Day War. Now, I want to stress this point: We fully respect Israel\\x92s profound \\r\\n\\t\\thistoric and religious ties to the city and to its holy sites. We\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tnever questioned that. This resolution in no manner prejudges the \\r\\n\\t\\toutcome of permanent status negotiations on East Jerusalem, which must, \\r\\n\\t\\tof course, reflect those historic ties and the realities on the ground. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\x92s our position. We still support it. We also strongly reject the notion that somehow the United States was \\r\\n\\t\\tthe driving force behind this resolution. The Egyptians and Palestinians \\r\\n\\t\\thad long made clear to all of us -- to all of the international community \\r\\n\\t\\t-- their intention to bring a resolution to a vote before the end of the \\r\\n\\t\\tyear, and we communicated that to the Israelis and they knew it anyway. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we \\r\\n\\t\\tput it forward. It was drafted by Egypt -- it was drafted and I think \\r\\n\\t\\tintroduced by Egypt, which is one of Israel\\x92s closest friends in the \\r\\n\\t\\tregion, in coordination with the Palestinians and others. And during the time of the process as it went out, we made clear to \\r\\n\\t\\tothers, including those on the Security Council, that it was possible \\r\\n\\t\\tthat if the resolution were to be balanced and it were to include \\r\\n\\t\\treferences to incitement and to terrorism, that it was possible the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States would then not block it, that -- if it was balanced and \\r\\n\\t\\tfair. That\\x92s a standard practice with resolutions at the Security \\r\\n\\t\\tCouncil. The Egyptians and the Palestinians and many others understood \\r\\n\\t\\tthat if the text were more balanced, it was possible we wouldn\\x92t block \\r\\n\\t\\tit. But we also made crystal clear that the President of the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates would not make a final decision about our own position until we \\r\\n\\t\\tsaw the final text. In the end, we did not agree with every word in this resolution. There \\r\\n\\t\\tare important issues that are not sufficiently addressed or even \\r\\n\\t\\taddressed at all. But we could not in good conscience veto a resolution \\r\\n\\t\\tthat condemns violence and incitement and reiterates what has been for a \\r\\n\\t\\tlong time the overwhelming consensus and international view on \\r\\n\\t\\tsettlements and calls for the parties to start taking constructive steps \\r\\n\\t\\tto advance the two-state solution on the ground. Ultimately, it will be up to the Israeli people to decide whether the \\r\\n\\t\\tunusually heated attacks that Israeli officials have directed towards \\r\\n\\t\\tthis Administration best serve Israel\\x92s national interests and its \\r\\n\\t\\trelationship with an ally that has been steadfast in its support, as I \\r\\n\\t\\tdescribed. Those attacks, alongside allegations of U.S.-led conspiracy \\r\\n\\t\\tand other manufactured claims, distract attention from what the \\r\\n\\t\\tsubstance of this vote was really all about. And we all understand that Israel faces very serious threats in a very \\r\\n\\t\\ttough neighborhood. Israelis are rightfully concerned about making sure \\r\\n\\t\\tthat there is not a new terrorist haven right next door to them, often \\r\\n\\t\\treferencing what\\x92s happened with Gaza, and we understand that and we \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve there are ways to meet those needs of security. And Israelis are \\r\\n\\t\\tfully justified in decrying attempts to legitimize[1]their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this \\r\\n\\t\\tvote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a two-state \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution impossible. It was not about making peace with the Palestinians \\r\\n\\t\\tnow -- it was about making sure that peace with the Palestinians will be \\r\\n\\t\\tpossible in the future. Now, we all understand that Israel faces extraordinary, serious threats \\r\\n\\t\\tin a very tough neighborhood. And Israelis are very correct in making \\r\\n\\t\\tsure that there\\x92s not a terrorist haven right on their border. But this vote -- I can\\x92t emphasize enough -- is not about the possibility \\r\\n\\t\\tof arriving at an agreement that\\x92s going to resolve that overnight or in \\r\\n\\t\\tone year or two years. This is about a longer process. This is about how \\r\\n\\t\\twe make peace with the Palestinians in the future but preserve the \\r\\n\\t\\tcapacity to do so. So how do we get there? How do we get there, to that peace? Since the parties have not yet been able to resume talks, the U.S. and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Middle East Quartet have repeatedly called on both sides to \\r\\n\\t\\tindependently demonstrate a genuine commitment to the two-state solution \\r\\n\\t\\t-- not just with words, but with real actions and policies -- to create \\r\\n\\t\\tthe conditions for meaningful negotiations. We\\x92ve called for both sides to take significant steps on the ground to \\r\\n\\t\\treverse current trends and send a different message -- a clear message \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tthat they are prepared to fundamentally change the equation without \\r\\n\\t\\twaiting for the other side to act. We have pushed them to comply with their basic commitments under their \\r\\n\\t\\town prior agreements in order to advance a two-state reality on the \\r\\n\\t\\tground. We have called for the Palestinians to do everything in their power to \\r\\n\\t\\tstop violence and incitement, including publicly and consistently \\r\\n\\t\\tcondemning acts of terrorism and stopping the glorification of violence. And we have called on them to continue efforts to strengthen their own \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions and to improve governance, transparency, and \\r\\n\\t\\taccountability. And we have stressed that the Hamas arms buildup and militant activities \\r\\n\\t\\tin Gaza must stop. Along with our Quartet partners, we have called on Israel to end the \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicy of settlement construction and expansion, of taking land for \\r\\n\\t\\texclusive Israeli use and denying Palestinian development. To reverse the current process, the U.S. and our partners have \\r\\n\\t\\tencouraged Israel to resume the transfer of greater civil authority to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Palestinians in Area C, consistent with the transition that was \\r\\n\\t\\tcalled for by Oslo. And we have made clear that significant progress \\r\\n\\t\\tacross a range of sectors, including housing, agriculture, and natural \\r\\n\\t\\tresources, can be made without negatively impacting Israel\\x92s legitimate \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity needs. And we\\x92ve called for significantly easing the movement \\r\\n\\t\\tand access restrictions to and from Gaza, with due consideration for \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael\\x92s need to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. So let me stress here again: None of the steps that I just talked about \\r\\n\\t\\twould negatively impact Israel\\x92s security. Let me also emphasize this is not about offering limited economic \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasures that perpetuate the status quo. We\\x92re talking about significant \\r\\n\\t\\tsteps that would signal real progress towards creating two states. That\\x92s the bottom line: If we\\x92re serious about the two-state solution, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s time to start implementing it now. Advancing the process of \\r\\n\\t\\tseparation now, in a serious way, could make a significant difference in \\r\\n\\t\\tsaving the two-state solution and in building confidence in the citizens \\r\\n\\t\\tof both sides that peace is, indeed, possible. And much progress can be \\r\\n\\t\\tmade in advance of negotiations that can lay the foundation for \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiations, as contemplated by the Oslo process. In fact, these steps \\r\\n\\t\\twill help create the conditions for successful talks. Now, in the end, we all understand that a final status agreement can \\r\\n\\t\\tonly be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties. We\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid that again and again. We cannot impose the peace. There are other countries in the UN who believe it is our job to dictate \\r\\n\\t\\tthe terms of a solution in the Security Council. Others want us to \\r\\n\\t\\tsimply recognize a Palestinian state, absent an agreement. But I want to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake clear today, these are not the choices that we will make. We choose instead to draw on the experiences of the last eight years, to \\r\\n\\t\\tprovide a way forward when the parties are ready for serious \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiations. In a place where the narratives from the past powerfully \\r\\n\\t\\tinform and mold the present, it\\x92s important to understand the history. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe mark this year and next a series of milestones that I believe both \\r\\n\\t\\tillustrate the two sides of the conflict and form the basis for its \\r\\n\\t\\tresolution. It\\x92s worth touching on them briefly. A hundred and twenty years ago, the First Zionist Congress was convened \\r\\n\\t\\tin Basel by a group of Jewish visionaries, who decided that the only \\r\\n\\t\\teffective response to the waves of anti-Semitic horrors sweeping across \\r\\n\\t\\tEurope was to create a state in the historic home of the Jewish people, \\r\\n\\t\\twhere their ties to the land went back centuries -- a state that could \\r\\n\\t\\tdefend its borders, protect its people, and live in peace with its \\r\\n\\t\\tneighbors. That was the vision. That was the modern beginning, and it \\r\\n\\t\\tremains the dream of Israel today. Nearly 70 years ago, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 \\r\\n\\t\\tfinally paved the way to making the State of Israel a reality. The \\r\\n\\t\\tconcept was simple: to create two states for two peoples -- one Jewish, \\r\\n\\t\\tone Arab -- to realize the national aspirations of both Jews and \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinians. And both Israel and the PLO referenced Resolution 181 in \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir respective declarations of independence. The United States recognized Israel seven minutes after its creation. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut the Palestinians and the Arab world did not, and from its birth, \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael had to fight for its life. Palestinians also suffered terribly in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 1948 war, including many who had lived for generations in a land \\r\\n\\t\\tthat had long been their home too. And when Israel celebrates its 70th \\r\\n\\t\\tanniversary in 2018, the Palestinians will mark a very different \\r\\n\\t\\tanniversary: 70 years since what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe. Next year will also mark 50 years since the end of the Six-Day War, when \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael again fought for its survival. And Palestinians will again mark \\r\\n\\t\\tjust the opposite: 50 years of military occupation. Both sides have \\r\\n\\t\\taccepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for the \\r\\n\\t\\twithdrawal of Israel from territory that it occupied in 1967 in return \\r\\n\\t\\tfor peace and secure borders, as the basis for ending the conflict. It has been more than 20 years since Israel and the PLO signed their \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst agreement -- the Oslo Accords -- and the PLO formally recognized \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael. Both sides committed to a plan to transition much of the West \\r\\n\\t\\tBank and Gaza to Palestinian control during permanent status \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiations that would put an end to their conflict. Unfortunately, \\r\\n\\t\\tneither the transition nor the final agreement came about, and both \\r\\n\\t\\tsides bear responsibility for that. Finally, some 15 years ago, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia came out with \\r\\n\\t\\tthe historic Arab Peace Initiative, which offered fully normalized \\r\\n\\t\\trelations with Israel when it made peace -- an enormous opportunity then \\r\\n\\t\\tand now, which has never been fully been embraced. That history was critical to our approach to trying to find a way to \\r\\n\\t\\tresolve the conflict. And based on my experience with both sides over \\r\\n\\t\\tthe last four years, including the nine months of formal negotiations, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe core issues can be resolved if there is leadership on both sides \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitted to finding a solution. In the end, I believe the negotiations did not fail because the gaps \\r\\n\\t\\twere too wide, but because the level of trust was too low. Both sides \\r\\n\\t\\twere concerned that any concessions would not be reciprocated and would \\r\\n\\t\\tcome at too great a political cost. And the deep public skepticism only \\r\\n\\t\\tmade it more difficult for them to be able to take risks. In the countless hours that we spent working on a detailed framework, we \\r\\n\\t\\tworked through numerous formulations and developed specific bridging \\r\\n\\t\\tproposals, and we came away with a clear understanding of the \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental needs of both sides. In the past two and a half years, I \\r\\n\\t\\thave tested ideas with regional and international stakeholders, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding our Quartet partners. And I believe what has emerged from all \\r\\n\\t\\tof that is a broad consensus on balanced principles that would satisfy \\r\\n\\t\\tthe core needs of both sides. President Clinton deserves great credit for laying out extensive \\r\\n\\t\\tparameters designed to bridge gaps in advanced final status negotiations \\r\\n\\t\\t16 years ago. Today, with mistrust too high to even start talks, we\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tat the opposite end of the spectrum. Neither side is willing to even \\r\\n\\t\\trisk acknowledging the other\\x92s bottom line, and more negotiations that \\r\\n\\t\\tdo not produce progress will only reinforce the worst fears. Now, everyone understands that negotiations would be complex and \\r\\n\\t\\tdifficult, and nobody can be expected to agree on the final result in \\r\\n\\t\\tadvance. But if the parties could at least demonstrate that they \\r\\n\\t\\tunderstand the other side\\x92s most basic needs -- and are potentially \\r\\n\\t\\twilling to meet them if theirs are also met at the end of comprehensive \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiations -- perhaps then enough trust could be established to enable \\r\\n\\t\\ta meaningful process to begin. It is in that spirit that we offer the following principles -- not to \\r\\n\\t\\tprejudge or impose an outcome, but to provide a possible basis for \\r\\n\\t\\tserious negotiations when the parties are ready. Now, individual \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries may have more detailed policies on these issues -- as we do, by \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way -- but I believe there is a broad consensus that a final status \\r\\n\\t\\tagreement that could meet the needs of both sides would do the \\r\\n\\t\\tfollowing. Principle number one: Provide for secure and recognized international \\r\\n\\t\\tborders between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine, negotiated \\r\\n\\t\\tbased on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed equivalent swaps. Resolution 242, which has been enshrined in international law for 50 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, provides for the withdrawal of Israel from territory it occupied \\r\\n\\t\\tin 1967 in return for peace with its neighbors and secure and recognized \\r\\n\\t\\tborders. It has long been accepted by both sides, and it remains the \\r\\n\\t\\tbasis for an agreement today. As Secretary, one of the first issues that I worked out with the Arab \\r\\n\\t\\tLeague was their agreement that the reference in the Arab Peace \\r\\n\\t\\tInitiative to the 1967 lines would from now on include the concept of \\r\\n\\t\\tland swaps, which the Palestinians have acknowledged. And this is \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessary to reflect practical realities on the ground, and mutually \\r\\n\\t\\tagreed equivalent swaps that will ensure that the agreement is fair to \\r\\n\\t\\tboth sides. There is also broad recognition of Israel\\x92s need to ensure that the \\r\\n\\t\\tborders are secure and defensible, and that the territory of Palestine \\r\\n\\t\\tis viable and contiguous. Virtually everyone that I have spoken to has \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen clear on this principle as well: No changes by Israel to the 1967 \\r\\n\\t\\tlines will be recognized by the international community unless agreed to \\r\\n\\t\\tby both sides. Principle two: Fulfill the vision of the UN General Assembly Resolution \\r\\n\\t\\t181 of two states for two peoples, one Jewish and one Arab, with mutual \\r\\n\\t\\trecognition and full equal rights for all their respective citizens. This has been the fundamental -- the foundational principle of the \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo-state solution from the beginning: creating a state for the Jewish \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople and a state for the Palestinian people, where each can achieve \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir national aspirations. And Resolution 181 is incorporated into the \\r\\n\\t\\tfoundational documents of both the Israelis and Palestinians. \\r\\n\\t\\tRecognition of Israel as a Jewish state has been the U.S. position for \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, and based on my conversations in these last months, I am \\r\\n\\t\\tabsolutely convinced that many others are now prepared to accept it as \\r\\n\\t\\twell -- provided the need for a Palestinian state is also addressed. We also know that there are some 1.7 million Arab citizens who call \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael their home and must now and always be able to live as equal \\r\\n\\t\\tcitizens, which makes this a difficult issue for Palestinians and others \\r\\n\\t\\tin the Arab world. That\\x92s why it is so important that in recognizing \\r\\n\\t\\teach other\\x92s homeland -- Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Palestinian people -- both sides reaffirm their commitment to \\r\\n\\t\\tupholding full equal rights for all of their respective citizens. Principle number three: Provide for a just, agreed, fair, and realistic \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution to the Palestinian refugee issue, with international \\r\\n\\t\\tassistance, that includes compensation, options and assistance in \\r\\n\\t\\tfinding permanent homes, acknowledgment of suffering, and other measures \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessary for a comprehensive resolution consistent with two states for \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo peoples. The plight of many Palestinian refugees is heartbreaking, and all agree \\r\\n\\t\\tthat their needs have to be addressed. As part of a comprehensive \\r\\n\\t\\tresolution, they must be provided with compensation, their suffering \\r\\n\\t\\tmust be acknowledged, and there will be a need to have options and \\r\\n\\t\\tassistance in finding permanent homes. The international community can \\r\\n\\t\\tprovide significant support and assistance. I know we are prepared to do \\r\\n\\t\\tthat, including in raising money to help ensure the compensation and \\r\\n\\t\\tother needs of the refugees are met, and many have expressed a \\r\\n\\t\\twillingness to contribute to that effort, particularly if it brings \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace. But there is a general recognition that the solution must be \\r\\n\\t\\tconsistent with two states for two peoples, and cannot affect the \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental character of Israel. Principle four: Provide an agreed resolution for Jerusalem as the \\r\\n\\t\\tinternationally recognized capital of the two states, and protect and \\r\\n\\t\\tassure freedom of access to the holy sites consistent with the \\r\\n\\t\\testablished status quo. Now, Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue for both sides, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution will have to meet the needs not only of the parties, but of all \\r\\n\\t\\tthree monotheistic faiths. That is why the holy sites that are sacred to \\r\\n\\t\\tbillions of people around the world must be protected and remain \\r\\n\\t\\taccessible and the established status quo maintained. Most acknowledge \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Jerusalem should not be divided again like it was in 1967, and we \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve that. At the same time, there is broad recognition that there \\r\\n\\t\\twill be no peace agreement without reconciling the basic aspirations of \\r\\n\\t\\tboth sides to have capitals there. Principle five: Satisfy Israel\\x92s security needs and bring a full end, \\r\\n\\t\\tultimately, to the occupation, while ensuring that Israel can defend \\r\\n\\t\\titself effectively and that Palestine can provide security for its \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople in a sovereign and non-militarized state. Security is the fundamental issue for Israel together with a couple of \\r\\n\\t\\tothers I\\x92ve mentioned, but security is critical. Everyone understands \\r\\n\\t\\tthat no Israeli Government can ever accept an agreement that does not \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfy its security needs or that risk creating an enduring security \\r\\n\\t\\tthreat like Gaza transferred to the West Bank. And Israel must be able \\r\\n\\t\\tto defend itself effectively, including against terrorism and other \\r\\n\\t\\tregional threats. In fact, there is a real willingness by Egypt, Jordan, \\r\\n\\t\\tand others to work together with Israel on meeting key security \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges. And I believe that those collective efforts, including close \\r\\n\\t\\tcoordination on border security, intelligence-sharing, joint \\r\\n\\t\\tcooperations -- joint operation, can all play a critical role in securing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe peace. At the same time, fully ending the occupation is the fundamental issue \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the Palestinians. They need to know that the military occupation \\r\\n\\t\\titself will really end after an agreed transitional process. They need \\r\\n\\t\\tto know they can live in freedom and dignity in a sovereign state while \\r\\n\\t\\tproviding security for their population even without a military of their \\r\\n\\t\\town. This is widely accepted as well. And it is important to understand \\r\\n\\t\\tthere are many different ways without occupation for Israel and \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestine and Jordan and Egypt and the United States and others to \\r\\n\\t\\tcooperate in providing that security. Now, balancing those requirements was among the most important \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges that we faced in the negotiations, but it was one where the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States has the ability to provide the most assistance. And that \\r\\n\\t\\tis why a team that was led by General John Allen, who is here, for whom \\r\\n\\t\\tI am very grateful for his many hours of effort, along with -- he is one \\r\\n\\t\\tof our foremost military minds, and dozens of experts from the \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment of Defense and other agencies, all of them engaged \\r\\n\\t\\textensively with the Israeli Defense Force on trying to find solutions \\r\\n\\t\\tthat could help Israel address its legitimate security needs. They developed innovative approaches to creating unprecedented, \\r\\n\\t\\tmulti-layered border security; enhancing Palestinian capacity; enabling \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael to retain the ability to address threats by itself even when the \\r\\n\\t\\toccupation had ended. General Allen and his team were not suggesting one \\r\\n\\t\\tparticular outcome or one particular timeline, nor were they suggesting \\r\\n\\t\\tthat technology alone would resolve these problems. They were simply \\r\\n\\t\\tworking on ways to support whatever the negotiators agreed to. And they \\r\\n\\t\\tdid some very impressive work that gives me total confidence that \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael\\x92s security requirements can be met. Principle six: End the conflict and all outstanding claims, enabling \\r\\n\\t\\tnormalized relations and enhanced regional security for all as envisaged \\r\\n\\t\\tby the Arab Peace Initiative. It is essential for both sides that the \\r\\n\\t\\tfinal status agreement resolves all the outstanding issues and finally \\r\\n\\t\\tbrings closure to this conflict, so that everyone can move ahead to a \\r\\n\\t\\tnew era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. For Israel, this must \\r\\n\\t\\talso bring broader peace with all of its Arab neighbors. That is the \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental promise of the Arab Peace Initiative, which key Arab leaders \\r\\n\\t\\thave affirmed in these most recent days. The Arab Peace Initiative also envisions enhanced security for all of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe region. It envisages Israel being a partner in those efforts when \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace is made. This is the area where Israel and the Arab world are \\r\\n\\t\\tlooking at perhaps the greatest moment of potential transformation in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Middle East since Israel\\x92s creation in 1948. The Arab world faces \\r\\n\\t\\tits own set of security challenges. With Israeli-Palestinian peace, \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael, the United States, Jordan, Egypt -- together with the GCC \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries -- would be ready and willing to define a new security \\r\\n\\t\\tpartnership for the region that would be absolutely groundbreaking. So ladies and gentlemen, that\\x92s why it is vital that we all work to keep \\r\\n\\t\\topen the possibility of peace, that we not lose hope in the two-state \\r\\n\\t\\tsolution, no matter how difficult it may seem -- because there really is \\r\\n\\t\\tno viable alternative. Now, we all know that a speech alone won\\x92t produce peace. But based on \\r\\n\\t\\tover 30 years of experience and the lessons from the past 4 years, I \\r\\n\\t\\thave suggested, I believe, and President Obama has signed on to and \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieves in a path that the parties could take: realistic steps on the \\r\\n\\t\\tground now, consistent with the parties\\x92 own prior commitments, that \\r\\n\\t\\twill begin the process of separating into two states; a political \\r\\n\\t\\thorizon to work towards to create the conditions for a successful final \\r\\n\\t\\tstatus talk; and a basis for negotiations that the parties could accept \\r\\n\\t\\tto demonstrate that they are serious about making peace. We can only encourage them to take this path; we cannot walk down it for \\r\\n\\t\\tthem. But if they take these steps, peace would bring extraordinary \\r\\n\\t\\tbenefits in enhancing the security and the stability and the prosperity \\r\\n\\t\\tof Israelis, Palestinians, all of the nations of the region. The \\r\\n\\t\\tPalestinian economy has amazing potential in the context of \\r\\n\\t\\tindependence, with major private sector investment possibilities and a \\r\\n\\t\\ttalented, hungry, eager-to-work young workforce. Israel\\x92s economy could \\r\\n\\t\\tenjoy unprecedented growth as it becomes a regional economic powerhouse, \\r\\n\\t\\ttaking advantage of the unparalleled culture of innovation and trading \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities with new Arab partners. Meanwhile, security challenges \\r\\n\\t\\tcould be addressed by an entirely new security arrangement, in which \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael cooperates openly with key Arab states. That is the future that \\r\\n\\t\\teverybody should be working for. President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled \\r\\n\\t\\tthat they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe longstanding U.S. policies on settlements, Jerusalem, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tpossibility of a two-state solution. That is for them to decide. That\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\thow we work. But we cannot -- in good conscience -- do nothing, and say \\r\\n\\t\\tnothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away. This is a time to stand up for what is right. We have long known what \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo states living side by side in peace and security looks like. We \\r\\n\\t\\tshould not be afraid to say so. Now, I really began to reflect on what we have learned -- and the way \\r\\n\\t\\tahead -- when I recently joined President Obama in Jerusalem for the \\r\\n\\t\\tstate funeral for Shimon Peres. Shimon was one of the founding fathers \\r\\n\\t\\tof Israel who became one of the world\\x92s great elder statesmen -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tbeautiful man. I was proud to call him my friend, and I know that \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Obama was as well. And I remembered the first time that I saw Shimon in person -- standing \\r\\n\\t\\ton the White House lawn for the signing the historic Oslo Accords. And I \\r\\n\\t\\tthought about the last time, at an intimate one-on-one Shabbat dinner \\r\\n\\t\\tjust a few months before he died, when we toasted together to the future \\r\\n\\t\\tof Israel and to the peace that he still so passionately believed in for \\r\\n\\t\\this people. He summed it up simply and eloquently, as only Shimon could, quote, \\x93The \\r\\n\\t\\toriginal mandate gave the Palestinians 48 percent, now it\\x92s down to 22 \\r\\n\\t\\tpercent. I think 78 percent is enough for us.\\x94 As we laid Shimon to rest that day, many of us couldn\\x92t help but wonder \\r\\n\\t\\tif peace between Israelis and Palestinians might also be buried along \\r\\n\\t\\twith one of its most eloquent champions. We cannot let that happen. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere is simply too much at stake -- for future generations of Israelis \\r\\n\\t\\tand Palestinians -- to give in to pessimism, especially when peace is, in \\r\\n\\t\\tfact, still possible. We must not lose hope in the possibility of peace. We must not give in \\r\\n\\t\\tto those who say what is now must always be, that there is no chance for \\r\\n\\t\\ta better future. It is up to Israelis and Palestinians to make the \\r\\n\\t\\tdifficult choices for peace, but we can all help. And for the sake of \\r\\n\\t\\tfuture generations of Israelis and Palestinians, for all the people of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe region, for the United States, for all those around the world who \\r\\n\\t\\thave prayed for and worked for peace for generations, let\\x92s hope that we \\r\\n\\t\\tare all prepared -- and particularly Israelis and Palestinians -- to make \\r\\n\\t\\tthose choices now. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " 'I was thinking, just a little while ago when I was here, the first thing I did was walk into a memorial service at the Embassy for Mustafa Akarsu. And I learned then that his name stands for sort of flowing waters, or waters flowing over, and there\\x92s that beautiful memorial now out in front of the Embassy. And he bravely gave his life, stepping up to prevent others from being harmed. Yesterday in Afghanistan, we had a different stealing of a young life. And I think there are no words for anybody to describe the extraordinary harsh contradiction of a young 25-year-old woman with all of the future ahead of her, believing in the possibilities of diplomacy, of changing people\\x92s lives, of making a difference, having an impact, who was taking knowledge in books to deliver them to a school. And someone, somehow persuaded that taking her -- his life was a wiser course and somehow constructive, drives into their vehicle1and we lose five lives -- two Foreign Service2, three military, large number wounded, one Foreign Service officer still in critical condition in the Kandahar hospital because they\\x92re trying to provide people with a future and with opportunity. The folks who want to kill people, and that\\x92s all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. And they want to shut the doors and they don\\x92t want people to make their choices about the future. For them, it\\x92s \\x93You do things my way and if you don\\x92t, we\\x92ll throw acid in your face. We\\x92ll put a bullet in your face,\\x94 to a young girl trying to learn. So this is a huge challenge for us. It is a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities, and everything that our country stands for, everything we stand for, is embodied in what Anne Smedinghoff stood for, a 25-year-old young woman, second tour of duty, been a vice consul in Caracas, Venezuela and then off to an exciting, challenging, unbelievable undertaking in one of the toughest places on earth. I met her about two weeks ago. She was part of my team that was my control team when I was there, and I remember her -- vivacious, smart, capable, chosen often by the Ambassador there to be the lead person because of her capacity. So it\\x92s a grim reminder to all of us, though we didn\\x92t need any reminders, of how important and also how risky carrying the future is with people who want to resist, and just trying to provide opportunity to those young boys and girls and men and women in Afghanistan, so many of whom I\\x92ve met, who believe in education and believe in the possibilities of opening a business and believe in the rights of women and the rights of everybody to be able to make choices. So I think every single one of us can stand very, very proud of Anne and her cohorts as America stands very, very proud of each and every one of you. This is not easy work. It\\x92s not easy being away from home. It\\x92s not easy packing up, breaking ties to family and friends and coming over to represent your country. But the whole world is in a state of transition right now. It is important for us to be able to help to bring stability and rule of law and alternatives to this kind of nihilistic violence that simply destroys and steals lives without offering any other constructive purpose whatsoever. So I think we can walk with pride. I think the extended Foreign Service family feels a lot of pain today. But we also feel pride. And it\\x92s my honor to be here with all of you to shake your hands, say hello to you, give everybody a hug, and let\\x92s share together the feelings of the Smedinghoff family, who I talked to yesterday in Pennsylvania. There is no more painful conversation in the world. And they were extraordinary and are strong, and I ask you all to pray for them and their friends and their family, and just keep your heads high and keep doing what you do, because we\\x92re so proud of you.

Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friend,Mr. Orson Welles. Orson Welles: Thank you, Dean.\\xa0It\\'s always a pleasure to be back in one of these celebrity roasts of yours, where a gang of jolly, fun-loving people get together to use charm, wit, good humor for one shining purpose: to destroy another human being. I see nothing much has changed since my last appearance on this [stage]. Milton Berleis still looking around and jotting down everybody\\'s jokes. I seeSenator Goldwatersitting there, still trying to dream up a way to keep the Panama Canal in American hands. This evening we\\'re assembled to honorJimmy Stewart, who\\'s not only a fine actor but whose very image as a man seems to be typical of all that America used to stand for. And I say \"used to\" because today\\'s screen heroes are a far cry from that gentle, nonviolent fellow Jimmy\\'s been portraying throughout his long and triumphant career. Just to show you what I mean, let\\'s look at some of today\\'s leading men. I sawCharles Bronsonin a movie recently, where Charles, certainly a fine actor, merely playing what the public wants him to play, grabbed a beautiful girl, pulled her out of a room, belted her in the chops, and threw her down three flights of stairs -- and this was the love scene. Jimmy may have hemmed and hawed -- but he never hit. AndBurt Reynolds, one of the very best of our newer stars, when he plays a cop, he jumps into his cruiser car, drives a hundred miles an hour, firing with a submachine gun, smashing and crashing 50 cars, buses, and trucks on the way, just so when he catches the guy he can give him a citation for blowing his horn in a hospital zone. That\\'s what\\'s happening on the silver screen today. By now we can see how much we needed that soft-spoken, shy, kind-hearted fellow that Jimmy Stewart plays. No brutality for Jimmy -- no, sir. And as for mindless violence, why even in Jimmy\\'s picture calledThe FBI Story, which sounds like a perfect excuse for gun fire, car smashing -- well, Jimmy did it the decent way. In one scene while he was chasing John Dillinger, that notorious criminal, had a flat tire on his sedan, and instead of smashing into Dillinger, Jimmy got out of his car, looked the villain straight in the eye, and fixed the flat. Jimmy, to use a metaphor, the movie industry is a -- well it\\'s sometimes called a jungle, but I think it\\'s a forest, a forest made up of a million different plants and trees and shrubs. And some of these plants have a brief day in the sun -- they flower quickly, but they can\\'t seem to sustain, so they wither away. Hollywood has seen a lot of these. But a career like yours, Jimmy, is an evergreen. Rain or shine it keeps growing. Because is had a kind of beauty and purpose it will never die. That\\'s what we\\'ve always seen in you, something that will be here when all the fads and fancies are long gone. As an image, Jimmy Stewart is indelible. As an actor -- well, I saw him on the stage in New York long before he went to Hollywood -- well, long before Hollywood got him. No, that\\'s not -- that\\'s wrong. Hollywood never got Jimmy Stewart. He was the conqueror. He was and is superb -- and I use that word very carefully. I pause for a parentheses -- I\\'m the only actor on this podium who has not attempted to imitate you, Jimmy, because in my view that\\'s all we can do.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much. What an amazing crowd. Thank you for this warm welcome. Thank you so \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch. One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it \\r\\n\\t\\toffers us every four years to change course. It\\'s not a guarantee; it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tonly an opportunity. The question facing us simply put is: Will we seize this opportunity for a change? That\\'s why I came here tonight to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama President of the United States of America. Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn\\'t really matter who became President. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity, and some assumed we would continue with both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn\\'t matter. Take it from me. If it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq; we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We wouldn\\'t be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we\\'d be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we\\'d be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we\\'d be solving the climate crisis. Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies, those policies, all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that\\'s ridiculous. With John McCain\\'s support, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to facts, their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few, and short-circuit the rule of law. If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain\\'s your man. If you believe it\\'s time for a change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. What a great speech Joe Biden gave last night. Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold, new economic plan to restore America\\'s greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education, and pro-family; establish a foreign policy that is smart, as well as strong; provide health care for all and solutions for the climate crisis. So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents. There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said throughout this land for many years, we are borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits, as -- \\r\\n\\t\\tas you know, have soared to record levels, and gasoline prices have gone through the roof, and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels. Many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising; fires are raging; storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world. And scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions. We are facing a planetary emergency, which, if not solved, would exceed anything we\\'ve ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain\\'s past record of open-mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis, he has now apparently allowed his Party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution. And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels. Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost a hundred years ago, Thomas Edison, our most famous inventor, said, quote, \"I would put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power,\" he continued. \"I hope we don\\'t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" Well, now, in 2008, we have everything we need to start using the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation, and efficiency to solve the climate crisis -- everything, that is, except a President in the White House who inspires us to believe, \"Yes, we can.\" And we know how to fix that. So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry -- big oil and coal -- have a 50-year lease on the Republican Party and they\\'re drilling it for everything it\\'s worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public that they\\'re actually solving the problem, when they\\'re, in fact, making it worse every single day. This Administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock, and barrel after barrel have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products, and this is certainly true of today\\'s Republican Party. The Party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican Party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national well-being are now irreconcilable choices. So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama\\'s message of hope and change to every family in America and pledge that we\\'ll be there for him, not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath, as we put his agenda to work for our country. We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, exactly why our nation so badly needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney, and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it\\'s time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it\\'s time for a change. After they abandoned the principle first laid down by General George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it\\'s time for a change. When as many as three Supreme Court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next President, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman\\'s right to choose, it is time for a change. Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such a change. How will we know when it\\'s beginning to take hold? I think we might recognize it as a sign of such change if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters. You are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama\\'s message of change and hope. You recognize that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you\\'re tired -- we\\'re all tired -- of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what we have seen in recent years. And you\\'re hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution. There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency, and rising, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change. A century-and-a-half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest President. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln\\'s experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress, during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it was started, but later condemned by history. The experience that Lincoln\\'s supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition. Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance. And the extraordinary strength of his personal character -- and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle -- whogave such a magnificent addressand will be such a wonderful First Lady for our country -- their strength of character is grounded in the strengths of the American community. Barack Obama\\'s vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto,E pluribus unum, -- \"out of many, one.\" That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul, that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations to redeem the promise of human freedom. Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb, \"When you pray, move your feet.\" And then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world, and our children and their future, by electing Barack Obama President of the United States of America.',\n",
       " 'We are here -- thank you -- We are here tonight \\r\\n-- We are here tonight because we love our country. We\\'re proud of what America is and what it can \\r\\nbecome. My fellow Americans, we\\'re here tonight united in \\r\\none purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world. A great American -- A great American novelist \\r\\nwrote that you can\\'t go home again. He could not have imagined this evening. \\r\\nTonight, I am home; home -- home where my public life began and those who made \\r\\nit possible live;\\xa0 home where our nation\\'s history was written in blood, \\r\\nidealism, and hope; home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, \\r\\nand country. Thank you. Thank you, all of you, for a welcome \\r\\nhome I will never forget. I -- I wish -- I wish my parents could share this \\r\\nmoment. They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their \\r\\ninspiration, their gift of open eyes, and open eyes, and open mind, and endless \\r\\nheart, and, and world that doesn\\'t have an end -- are bigger and more lasting \\r\\nthan any words at all. I was born, as you -- some of you saw in the film \\r\\nin Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado -- when my dad was a pilot in World War \\r\\nII. Now, I am not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital \\r\\nthe maternity ward was in? I\\'m not kidding. I was born in the West Wing. My mother -- My mother was the rock of our \\r\\nfamily, as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me with my homework. \\r\\nShe sat by my bed when I was sick. She answered the questions of a child who, \\r\\nlike all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries. She was my den \\r\\nmother when I was a Cub Scout, and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a \\r\\nGirl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment. She taught me to \\r\\nsee trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she \\r\\nshowed me that we can and must complete the march towards full equality for all \\r\\nwomen in the United States of America. My dad -- My dad did the things that a boy \\r\\nremembers. My dad did the things that a boy remembers. He gave me my first model \\r\\nairplane, my first baseball mitt, my first bicycle. He also taught me that we \\r\\nare here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities \\r\\nand the sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much. And when I was a young man, he was in the State \\r\\nDepartment, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between \\r\\ndemocracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized \\r\\nby the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own \\r\\npart of the city, and Russians standing guard on that stark line separating East \\r\\nfrom West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I \\r\\nproudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me. But what I learned has stayed with me for a \\r\\nlifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I \\r\\nsaw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free. I saw the gratitude of \\r\\npeople towards the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as \\r\\nI got off a military train and I heard the Army band strike up \"Stars and \\r\\nStripes Forever.\" I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned \\r\\nthe pride of our freedom. And I am determined now to restore that pride to all \\r\\nwho look to America. Mine -- Mine were greatest -- Mine were greatest \\r\\ngeneration parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank a whole \\r\\ngeneration for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold \\r\\nWar, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of \\r\\npeace and prosperity. My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a \\r\\nhigh school, a junior, John Kennedy called my generation to service. It was the \\r\\nbeginning of a great journey -- a time to march for civil rights, for voting \\r\\nrights, for the environment, for women, for peace. We believed we could change \\r\\nthe world. And you know what? We did. But we\\'re not finished. But we\\'re not finished. \\r\\nThe journey isn\\'t complete. The march isn\\'t over. The promise isn\\'t perfected. \\r\\nTonight, we\\'re setting out again. And together, we\\'re going to write the next \\r\\ngreat chapter of America\\'s story. We -- We have it in our power to change the \\r\\nworld but only if we\\'re true to our ideals, and that starts by telling the truth \\r\\nto the American people. As President, that is my first pledge to you \\r\\ntonight. As President, I will restore trust and \\r\\ncredibility to the White House. I ask you -- I ask you to judge me by my record: \\r\\nAs a young prosecutor, I fought for victim\\'s rights and made prosecuting \\r\\nviolence against women a priority. When I came to the Senate, I broke with many \\r\\nin my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the \\r\\nright thing to do. I fought to put a 100,000 police officers on the streets of \\r\\nAmerica. And then, I reached out across the aisle with John McCain, to work to \\r\\nfind the truth about our POW\\'s and \"Missing in Action,\" and to finally make \\r\\npeace in Vietnam. I -- I will be -- I will be a Commander-in-Chief \\r\\nwho will never mislead us into war. I will have a Vice President who will not \\r\\nconduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will \\r\\nhave a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the advice of the military \\r\\nleaders. And I will appoint an Attorney General who will uphold the Constitution \\r\\nof the United States. My fellow Americans -- My -- My fellow Americans \\r\\nthis is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are \\r\\na nation at war -- a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we\\'ve ever \\r\\nknown before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, \\r\\nand our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends -- two \\r\\njobs, three jobs; and they\\'re still not getting ahead. We\\'re told that outsourcing jobs is good for \\r\\nAmerica. We\\'re told -- We\\'re told that new jobs that pay 9,000 dollars less than \\r\\nthe jobs that have been lost is the best that we can do. They say this is the \\r\\nbest economy that we\\'ve ever had. And they say, anyone who thinks otherwise is a \\r\\npessimist. Well here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than \\r\\nsaying that America can\\'t do better. We\\'re -- We can do better. We can do better and \\r\\nwe will. We\\'re the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We\\'re the \\r\\n\"can do\" people. And let\\'s not forget what we did in the 1990s. We \\r\\nbalanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We \\r\\nlifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the \\r\\nmiddle class. We just need to believe in ourselves -- and we can do it again. So tonight -- So tonight -- So tonight -- So \\r\\ntonight, in the city where America\\'s freedom began, only a few blocks from where \\r\\nthe sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation -- here tonight, on \\r\\nbehalf of a new birth of freedom, on behalf of the middle class who deserve a \\r\\nchampion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot; for the brave \\r\\nmen and women in uniform who risk their lives and for their families who pray \\r\\nfor their return; for all those who believe that our best days are ahead of us \\r\\n-- with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for \\r\\nPresident of the United States. I am proud -- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \\r\\nThank you. I -- I am proud -- I am proud that at my side \\r\\nwill be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who\\'s \\r\\nworked every day to make that dream real for all Americans: Senator John Edwards \\r\\nof North Carolina and his wife Elizabeth and their family. Thank you. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead, and \\r\\nnext January Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to \\r\\nsucceed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States. And -- And what can I say about Teresa? She -- She has the strongest moral compass of \\r\\nanyone I know. She\\'s down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise, and smart. She \\r\\nspeaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And \\r\\nthat\\'s why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States. For Teresa -- For Teresa and me -- For Teresa and \\r\\nme, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever \\r\\nmean as much as our children, as you could sense, listening to them. We love \\r\\nthem not just for who they are and what they\\'ve become, but for being \\r\\nthemselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me \\r\\nget away with anything. Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John. And in this journey, I am accompanied by an \\r\\nextraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot called Max \\r\\nCleland. Our band of brothers -- Our band of brothers doesn\\'t march because of \\r\\nwho we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought \\r\\nfor this nation because we loved it, and we came back with the deep belief that \\r\\nevery day is extra. We may be a little older. We may be a little grayer, but we \\r\\nstill know how to fight for our country. And standing with us in that fight -- Standing \\r\\nwith us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the \\r\\nprimary campaign: Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick \\r\\nGephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman, Al Sharpton. To all of \\r\\nyou, I say \"thank you\" for teaching me and testing me. But mostly, we say \"thank \\r\\nyou\" for standing up for our country and for giving us the unity to move America \\r\\nforward. My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very \\r\\ndifferent from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people \\r\\nare more than equal to the challenge. Remember the hours after September 11th, when we \\r\\ncame together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength \\r\\nwhen our firefighters ran up stairs and risked their lives, so that others might \\r\\nlive. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. When the men and \\r\\nwomen of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation\\'s Capitol. When \\r\\nflags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became \\r\\nfriends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in \\r\\nall of us. I am proud -- I am proud that after September \\r\\n11th all our people rallied to President Bush\\'s call for unity to meet the \\r\\ndanger. There were no Democrats. There were no Republicans. There were only \\r\\nAmericans. And how we wish it had stayed that way. Now I know -- Now I know that there are those who \\r\\ncriticize me for seeing complexities -- and I do -- because some issues just \\r\\naren\\'t all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \\r\\ndoesn\\'t make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn\\x92t make it so. \\r\\nAnd proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn\\'t make it so. As President -- As President, I will ask the hard \\r\\nquestions and demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence \\r\\nsystem, so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics. \\r\\nAnd as President -- as President, I will bring back this nation\\'s time-honored \\r\\ntradition: The United States of America never goes to war because we want to; we \\r\\nonly go to war because we have to. That is the standard of our nation. I know -- I know what kids go through when \\r\\nthey\\'re carrying -- I -- I know what kids go through when they\\'re \\r\\ncarrying an M-16 in a dangerous place, and they can\\'t tell friend from foe. I \\r\\nknow what they go through when they\\'re out on patrol at night and they don\\'t \\r\\nknow what\\'s coming around the next bend. I know what it\\'s like to write letters \\r\\nhome telling your family that everything\\'s all right when you\\'re just not sure \\r\\nthat that\\'s true. As President, I will wage this war with the \\r\\nlessons I learned in war. Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a \\r\\nparent in the eye and truthfully say: \"I tried everything possible to avoid \\r\\nsending your son or daughter into harm\\'s way. But we had no choice. We had to \\r\\nprotect the American people, fundamental American values against a threat that \\r\\nwas real and imminent.\" So lesson number one -- this is the only justification \\r\\nfor going to war. And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every \\r\\nman and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war \\r\\nwithout a plan to win the peace. I know -- I know what we have to do in Iraq. I know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a \\r\\nPresident who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the \\r\\nburden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, reduce the risk to American \\r\\nsoldiers. That\\'s the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home. Here is the reality: that won\\'t happen -- that \\r\\nwon\\'t happen until we have a president who restores America\\'s respect and \\r\\nleadership, so we don\\'t have to go it alone in the world. And we need -- And we need to rebuild our \\r\\nalliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us. I defended this country as a young man and I will \\r\\ndefend it as President. Let there be no mistake. Let their be no mistake: \\r\\nI will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met \\r\\nwith a swift and a certain response. I will never give any nation or any \\r\\ninstitution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger military. We will add \\r\\n40,000 active duty troops -- not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that \\r\\nare now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our \\r\\nspecial forces to conduct terrorist operations -- anti-terrorist operations. And \\r\\nwe will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their \\r\\nlives and win the battle. And we will end the backdoor draft of the National \\r\\nGuard and reservists. To all -- To all -- To all who serve in our armed \\r\\nforces today, I say, help is on the way. As President -- As President I will fight a \\r\\nsmarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: \\r\\nour economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our \\r\\nfirepower. In these dangerous days there is a right way and \\r\\na wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of \\r\\nexperience in national security, I know the reach of our power, and I know the \\r\\npower of our ideals. We need to make America once again a beacon in \\r\\nthe world. We need to be looked up to -- not just feared. We need to lead a global effort against nuclear \\r\\nproliferation to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most \\r\\ndangerous hands in the world. We need a strong military and we need [to lead] \\r\\nstrong alliances. And then -- And then with confidence and determination, we \\r\\nwill be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win. The future \\r\\ndoesn\\'t belong to fear; it belongs to freedom. And the front lines -- And the front lines of \\r\\nthis battle are not just far away; they\\'re right here on our shores. They\\'re at \\r\\nour airports, and potentially in any city or town. Today, our national security \\r\\nbegins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to \\r\\nfollow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families. As President, \\r\\nI will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement all the \\r\\nrecommendations of that commission. We shouldn\\'t be letting ninety-five percent \\r\\nof our container ships come into our ports without ever being physically \\r\\ninspected. We shouldn\\'t be leaving nuclear and chemical plants without enough \\r\\nprotection. And we shouldn\\'t be opening firehouses in Baghdad and shutting them \\r\\nin the United States of America. And tonight -- And tonight -- And tonight we have an important message for \\r\\nthose who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for \\r\\nour country. Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes to \\r\\nthe truth and \\r\\ntheir ears, they should remember what America is really all about. They \\r\\nshould remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their \\r\\nlives. Our purpose now is to reclaim our democracy itself. We are here to affirm \\r\\nthat when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do \\r\\nbetter, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of \\r\\npatriotism. You see -- You see that flag -- You see that that flag up there? We call her \\r\\n\"Old Glory\" -- \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" I fought under that flag, as did so many \\r\\nof those people who were here tonight and all across the country. That flag flew from the gun turret  \\r\\nbehind my head, and it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never \\r\\nceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men that I served with and \\r\\nfriends I grew up with. For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we \\r\\nare and what we believe in: our strength, our diversity, our love of country -- \\r\\nall that makes America both great and good. That flag doesn\\'t belong to any president. It \\r\\ndoesn\\'t belong to any ideology. It doesn\\'t belong to any political party. It \\r\\nbelongs to all the American people. My fellow citizens -- thank you. My fellow citizens -- My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. \\r\\nAnd choices are about values. In the end, it\\'s not just policies and programs \\r\\nthat matter; the President who sits at that desk must be guided by principle. For four years, we\\'ve heard a lot of talk about \\r\\nvalues. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans. They\\'re -- Values are not \\r\\njust words. Values are what we live by. They\\'re about the causes we that champion and \\r\\nthe people we that fight for. And it\\'s time for those who talk about family values \\r\\nto start valuing families. You don\\'t value families -- You don\\'t value \\r\\nfamilies -- You don\\'t value families by kicking kids out of \\r\\nafter school programs and taking cops off that streets, so that Enron can get \\r\\nanother tax break. We believe -- We believe in the family value of caring for our \\r\\nchildren and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and they play. And that is the choice in this election. You don\\'t value families by denying real \\r\\nprescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another \\r\\nwindfall profit. We believe in the family value expressed in one \\r\\nof the oldest Commandments: \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\" As President, I \\r\\nwill not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we \\r\\nwill make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half \\r\\nbecause they can\\'t afford life-saving medicine. And that is a choice in this election. You don\\'t -- You don\\'t -- You don\\'t value \\r\\nfamilies if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son \\r\\nor daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell \\r\\nmiddle class families to wait for a tax cut, so the wealthiest among us can get even more. We believe in the value of doing what\\'s right for \\r\\neveryone in the American family. And that\\'s the choice in this election. We believe that what matters most is not narrow \\r\\nappeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of \\r\\nAmerica; not narrow values that divide us, but the shared values that unite us: \\r\\nfamily, faith,\\xa0 hard work, opportunity and responsibility for all, so that \\r\\nevery child, every adult, every parent, every worker in America has an equal shot at living up to their \\r\\nGod-given potential. That is the American dream and the American value. What -- What -- What -- What does it mean in America today when Dave \\r\\nMcCune, a steel worker that I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the \\r\\nequipment in his factory was literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of \\r\\nmiles away along with that job? What does it mean when workers I\\'ve met have had to \\r\\ntrain their foreign replacements? America can do better. And tonight we say, \"Help is \\r\\non the way.\" What does it mean -- What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman \\r\\nwith breast cancer that I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day \\r\\nthrough her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was \\r\\nterrified of losing her family\\'s health insurance. America can do better. And help is on the way. What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from \\r\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania works and she saves all her life and finds out that \\r\\nher pension has disappeared into thin air \\x96 and the executive who looted it has \\r\\nbailed out on a golden parachute? America can do better. And help is on the way. What does it mean when twenty five percent of our \\r\\nchildren in Harlem have asthma because of hair [air] pollution? We can do better. America can do better. And help is on the way. What does it mean when people are huddled in \\r\\nblankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White \\r\\nHouse itself and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three \\r\\nmillion in the last four years? America can do better. And help is on the way. So tonight, we come here tonight to ask: Where is the \\r\\nconscience of our country? I\\'ll tell you where it is. I\\'ll tell you where it \\r\\nis: it\\'s in rural and \\r\\nsmall town America; it\\'s in urban neighborhoods and the suburban main streets; it\\'s \\r\\nalive in the people that I\\'ve met in every single part of this land. It\\'s bursting in the \\r\\nhearts of Americans who are determined to give our values and our truth back to \\r\\nour country. We value jobs that actually pay you more than the \\r\\njob that you lost. We value jobs where, when you put in a week\\'s work, you can \\r\\nactually pay your bills, provide for your children, lift up the quality of \\r\\nyour life. We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but \\r\\ndoing better. So here is our economic plan to build a stronger \\r\\nAmerica: First, new incentives to revitalize \\r\\nmanufacturing. Second, investment in technology and innovation \\r\\nthat will create the good-paying jobs of the future. Third, close the tax loopholes that reward \\r\\ncompanies for shipping our jobs overseas. Instead, we will reward companies that \\r\\ncreate and keep the good paying jobs right where they belong -- in the good old U.S.A. We value -- We value an America that exports products, not \\r\\njobs. And we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss \\r\\nof their own job. Next, we will trade and we will compete in the world. But \\r\\nour plan calls for a fair playing field, because if you give the American \\r\\nworker a fair playing field, there\\'s no one in the world that the American worker \\r\\ncan\\'t compete against. And we\\'re going to return -- And we\\'re going to \\r\\nreturn to fiscal \\r\\nresponsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength. Our plan \\r\\nwill cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are \\r\\nnothing more than corporate welfare. And we will make government live by the rule \\r\\nthat every family has to live by: Pay as you go. And let me -- Let me tell you what we won\\'t do: We won\\'t \\r\\nraise taxes on the middle class. You\\'ve heard -- You\\'ve heard a lot of false charges about this \\r\\nin recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will \\r\\ncut middle class taxes. I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I \\r\\nwill roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over \\r\\n200,000 dollars a year, so we can invest in job health care, education, and job \\r\\ncreation. Our education plan for a stronger America sets \\r\\nhigh standards and it demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. \\r\\nIt provides for smaller class sizes and it treats teachers like the professionals \\r\\nthat they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of \\r\\ncollege. When I -- When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who \\r\\nwere in trouble, abandoned -- all of them -- by adults. And as President, I am determined that we \\r\\nstop being a nation content to spend 50,000 dollars a year to send a young \\r\\nperson to prison for the rest of their life -- when we could invest 10,000 \\r\\ndollars a year in \\r\\nHead Start, Early Start, Smart Start, a real start to the lives of our children. And we value -- And we value health care that\\'s affordable and \\r\\naccessible for all Americans. Since 2000, four million people have lost their \\r\\nhealth insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it. You know what\\'s happening. Your premiums, your \\r\\nco-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof. Our health care plan for a stronger America \\r\\ncracks down on the waste and the greed and the abuse in our health care system. \\r\\nAnd it will \\r\\nsave families a thousand dollars a year on premiums. You\\'ll get to pick your own \\r\\ndoctor -- and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make \\r\\nmedical decisions. Under our health care plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for \\r\\nseniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs \\r\\nfrom countries like Canada. The story of people -- The story of people struggling for health care is \\r\\nthe story of so many Americans. But you know what, it\\'s not the story of \\r\\nsenators and menators [members] of Congress. Because we give ourselves great health care \\r\\nand you get the bill. Well I\\'m here to say tonight, your family\\'s health care is just \\r\\nas important as any politician\\'s in Washington, D.C. And when I am President, we will stop being \\r\\nthe only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care \\r\\nis not a privilege for the wealthy and the connected and the elected \\x96 it is a \\r\\nright for all Americans. And we will make it so. We value an America -- We value an America that controls its own destiny \\r\\nbecause it\\'s finally and forever independent of Mideast oil. What does it mean \\r\\nfor our economy and our national security when we have only three percent of the \\r\\nworld\\'s oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent \\r\\nof what we consume? I want an America that relies on its  \\r\\ningenuity and innovation \\x96 not the Saudi royal family. And our energy plan for a stronger America -- our \\r\\nenergy plan will \\r\\ninvest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- \\r\\nso that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence \\r\\non oil from the Middle East. I\\'ve told you -- I\\'ve told you about our plans for the economy, \\r\\nfor education, for health care, for energy independence. I want you to know more \\r\\nabout them. So now I\\'m going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could \\r\\nnever have said in his acceptance speech: Go tojohnkerry.com. I - I want to address these next words directly to \\r\\nPresident George W. Bush. In -- In the weeks ahead -- In the weeks ahead let\\'s be optimists, not just \\r\\nopponents. Let\\'s build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let\\'s \\r\\nhonor this nation\\'s diversity; let\\'s respect one another; and let\\'s never misuse \\r\\nfor political purposes the most precious document in American history, the \\r\\nConstitution of the United States.  My friends -- My friends -- My friends -- My \\r\\nfriends, the high road may be harder -- the high road may be harder, but it \\r\\nleads to a better place. And that\\'s why Republicans and Democrats must make this \\r\\nelection a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to \\r\\nreject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, region from \\r\\nregion, group from \\r\\ngroup. Maybe some just see us divided into those red states and \\r\\nblue states, but I see us as one America -- red, white, and blue. And when I am \\r\\nPresident, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as \\r\\nwell as Democrats, to find the common ground, so that no one who has something \\r\\nto contribute to our nation will be left on the sidelines. And let me say it plainly: In that cause, and in \\r\\nthis campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think \\r\\nof what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to \\r\\nyou tonight: I don\\'t wear my religion on my sleeve. But faith -- But faith has given me \\r\\nvalues and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I \\r\\ndon\\'t want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want \\r\\nto pray humbly that we are on God\\'s side. And whatever -- And whatever our faith -- \\r\\nwhatever our faith, one belief \\r\\nshould bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of \\r\\nourselves for others and for our country. These aren\\'t Democratic values. These aren\\'t \\r\\nRepublican values. They\\'re American values. We believe in them. They\\'re who we \\r\\nare. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America \\r\\nthat is stronger at home and respected in the world. So much promise stretches before us. Americans \\r\\nhave always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: \\r\\nWhat if? Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked, \"What if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?\" It did that and \\r\\nit changed the \\r\\nworld forever. A young President asked, \"What if we could go to the moon in ten \\r\\nyears?\" And now we\\'re exploring the stars and the solar system themselves \\r\\n[exploring the solar system and stars themselves]. A \\r\\nyoung generation of entrepreneurs asked, \"What if we could take all the \\r\\ninformation in a library and put it on a chip the size of a fingernail?\" \\r\\nWe did that. And that too changed the world. And now it\\'s our time to ask: \"What if?\" What if we find a breakthrough to  \\r\\nParkinson\\'s, diabetes, Alzheimer\\'s and AIDS? What if we have a President -- What \\r\\nif we have a President who \\r\\nbelieves in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell \\r\\nand treat illness for millions of lives? What -- What if -- What if we -- What if we do what adults should do and make \\r\\nsure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school? What if we \\r\\nhave a leadership that\\'s as good as the American dream, so that bigotry and \\r\\nhatred never again steal the hope or future of any American? I -- I learned a lot about these values on that \\r\\ngunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with Americans -- you saw them -- who come from places as \\r\\ndifferent as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida, California. No one -- No one cared -- No one cared \\r\\nwhere we went to school. No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were \\r\\nliterally all in the same boat. We looked out -- We looked out one for the other, and we still \\r\\ndo. That is the kind of America I will lead as \\r\\nPresident -- an America where we are all in the same boat. Never has there been a moment more urgent for \\r\\nAmericans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out. But, my \\r\\nfellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine. It is time to reach for the next dream. It is \\r\\ntime to look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is \\r\\nrising. Our best days are still to come. Thank you. Good night. God bless you. And God \\r\\nbless the United States of America.',\n",
       " \"Good evening from the great \\r\\ncity of New Orleans. Tonight, we can say with confidence the primary season is \\r\\nover, and the general election campaign has begun. I commend both Senators Obama \\r\\nand Clinton for the long, hard race they have run. Senator Obama has impressed \\r\\nmany Americans with his eloquence and his spirited campaign. Senator Clinton has \\r\\nearned great respect for her tenacity and courage. The media often overlooked \\r\\nhow compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of \\r\\nAmericans, and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received. \\r\\nAs the father of three daughters, I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of \\r\\nwomen to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their \\r\\nreach. I am proud to call her my friend. Pundits and party elders have declared \\r\\nthat Senator Obama will be my opponent. He will be a formidable o ne. But I'm \\r\\nready for the challenge, and determined to run this race in a way that does \\r\\ncredit to our campaign and to the proud, decent and patriotic people I ask to \\r\\nlead.The decision facing Americans in this election couldn't be more important to the \\r\\nfuture security and prosperity of American families. This is, indeed, a change \\r\\nelection. No matter who wins this election, the direction of this country is \\r\\ngoing to change dramatically. But, the choice is between the right change and \\r\\nthe wrong change; between going forward and going backward.America has seen tough times before. We've always known how to get through them. \\r\\nAnd we've always believed our best days are ahead of us. I believe that still. \\r\\nBut we must rise to the occasion, as we always have; change what must be \\r\\nchanged; and make the future better than the past.The right change recognizes that many of the policies and institutions of our \\r\\ngovernment have failed. They have failed to keep up with the challenges of our \\r\\ntime because many of these policies were designed for the problems and \\r\\nopportunities of the mid to late 20th Century, before the end of the Cold War; \\r\\nbefore the revolution in information technology and rise of the global economy. \\r\\nThe right kind of change will initiate widespread and innovative reforms in \\r\\nalmost every area of government policy -- health care, energy, the environment, \\r\\nthe tax code, our public schools, our transportation system, disaster relief, \\r\\ngovernment spending and regulation, diplomacy, the military and intelligence \\r\\nservices. Serious and far-reaching reforms are needed in so many areas of \\r\\ngovernment to meet our own challenges in our own time.The irony is that Americans have been experiencing a lot of change in their \\r\\nlives attributable to these historic events, and some of those changes have \\r\\ndistressed many American families -- job loss, failing schools, prohibitively \\r\\nexpensive health care, pensions at risk, entitlement programs approaching \\r\\nbankruptcy, rising gas and food prices, to name a few. But your government often \\r\\nacts as if it is completely unaware of the changes and hardships in your lives. \\r\\nAnd when government does take notice, often it only makes matters worse. For too \\r\\nlong, we have let history outrun our government's ability to keep up with it. \\r\\nThe right change will stop impeding Americans from doing what they have always \\r\\ndone: overcome every obstacle to our progress, turn challenges into \\r\\nopportunities, and by our own industry, imagination and courage make a better \\r\\ncountry and a safer world th an we inherited.To keep our nation prosperous, strong and growing we have to rethink, reform and \\r\\nreinvent: the way we educate our children; train our workers; deliver health \\r\\ncare services; support retirees; fuel our transportation network; stimulate \\r\\nresearch and development; and harness new technologies.To keep us safe we must rebuild the structure and mission of our military; the \\r\\ncapabilities of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies; the reach and \\r\\nscope of our diplomacy; the capacity of all branches of government to defend us. \\r\\nWe need to strengthen our alliances, and preserve our moral credibility.We must also prepare, far better than we have, to respond quickly and \\r\\neffectively to a natural calamity. When Americans confront a catastrophe they \\r\\nhave a right to expect basic competence from their government. Firemen and \\r\\npolicemen should be able to communicate with each other in an emergency. We \\r\\nshould be able to deliver bottled water to dehydrated babies and rescue the \\r\\ninfirm from a hospital with no electricity. Our disgraceful failure to do so \\r\\nhere in New Orleans exposed the incompetence of government at all levels to meet \\r\\neven its most basic responsibilities.The wrong change looks not to the future but to the past for solutions that have \\r\\nfailed us before and will surely fail us again. I have a few years on my \\r\\nopponent, so I am surprised that a young man has bought in to so many failed \\r\\nideas. Like others before him, he seems to think government is the answer to \\r\\nevery problem; that government should take our resources and make our decisions \\r\\nfor us. That type of change doesn't trust Americans to know what is right or \\r\\nwhat is in their own best interests. It's the attitude of politicians who are \\r\\nsure of themselves but have little faith in the wisdom, decency and common sense \\r\\nof free people. That attitude created the unresponsive bureaucracies of big \\r\\ngovernment in the first place. And that's not change we can believe in.You will hear from my opponent's campaign in every speech, every interview, \\r\\nevery press release that I'm running for President Bush's third term. You will \\r\\nhear every policy of the President described as the Bush-McCain policy. Why does \\r\\nSenator Obama believe it's so important to repeat that idea over and over again? \\r\\nBecause he knows it's very difficult to get Americans to believe something they \\r\\nknow is false. So he tries to drum it into your minds by constantly repeating it \\r\\nrather than debate honestly the very different directions he and I would take \\r\\nthe country. But the American people didn't get to know me yesterday, as they \\r\\nare just getting to know Senator Obama. They know I have a long record of \\r\\nbipartisan problem solving. They've seen me put our country before any President \\r\\n-- before any party -- before any special interest -- before my own interest. \\r\\nThey might think me an imperfect servant of our country, which I surely am. But \\r\\nI am her servant first, last and always.I have worked with the President to keep our nation safe. But he and I have not \\r\\nseen eye to eye on many issues. We've disagreed over the conduct of the war in \\r\\nIraq and the treatment of detainees; over out of control government spending and \\r\\nbudget gimmicks; over energy policy and climate change; over defense spending \\r\\nthat favored defense contractors over the public good.I disagreed strongly with the Bush administration's mismanagement of the war in \\r\\nIraq. I called for the change in strategy that is now, at last, succeeding where \\r\\nthe previous strategy had failed miserably. I was criticized for doing so by \\r\\nRepublicans. I was criticized by Democrats. I was criticized by the press. But I \\r\\ndon't answer to them. I answer to you. And I would be ashamed to admit I knew \\r\\nwhat had to be done in Iraq to spare us from a defeat that would endanger us for \\r\\nyears, but I kept quiet because it was too politically hard for me to do. No \\r\\nambition is more important to me than the security of the country I have \\r\\ndefended all my adult life.Senator Obama opposed the new strategy, and, after promising not to, voted to \\r\\ndeny funds to the soldiers who have done a brilliant and brave job of carrying \\r\\nit out. Yet in the last year we have seen the success of that plan as violence \\r\\nhas fallen to a four year low; Sunni insurgents have joined us in the fight \\r\\nagainst al Qaeda; the Iraqi Army has taken the lead in places once lost to Sunni \\r\\nand Shia extremists; and the Iraqi Government has begun to make progress toward \\r\\npolitical reconciliation.None of this progress would have happened had we not changed course over a year \\r\\nago. And all of this progress would be lost if Senator Obama had his way and \\r\\nbegan to withdraw our forces from Iraq without concern for conditions on the \\r\\nground and the advice of commanders in the field. Americans ought to be \\r\\nconcerned about the judgment of a presidential candidate who says he's ready to \\r\\ntalk, in person and without conditions, with tyrants from Havana to Pyongyang, \\r\\nbut hasn't traveled to Iraq to meet with General Petraeus, and see for himself \\r\\nthe progress he threatens to reverse.I know Americans are tired of this war. I don't oppose a reckless withdrawal \\r\\nfrom Iraq because I'm indifferent to the suffering war inflicts on too many \\r\\nAmerican families. I hate war. And I know very personally how terrible its costs \\r\\nare. But I know, too, that the course Senator Obama advocates could draw us into \\r\\na wider war with even greater sacrifices; put peace further out of reach, and \\r\\nAmericans back in harm's way.I take America's economic security as seriously as I do her physical security. \\r\\nFor eight years the federal government has been on a spending spree that added \\r\\ntrillions to the national debt. It spends more and more of your money on \\r\\nprograms that have failed again and again to keep up with the changes \\r\\nconfronting American families. Extravagant spending on things that are not the \\r\\nbusiness of government indebts us to other nations; fuels inflation; raises \\r\\ninterest rates; and encourages irresponsibility. I have opposed wasteful \\r\\nspending by both parties and the Bush administration. Senator Obama has \\r\\nsupported it and proposed more of his own. I want to freeze discretionary \\r\\nspending until we have completed top to bottom reviews of all federal programs \\r\\nto weed out failing ones. Senator Obama opposes that reform. I opposed subsidies \\r\\nthat favor big business over small farmers and tariffs on imported products that \\r\\nhave greatly increased the cost of food. Senator Obama supports these billions \\r\\nof dollars in corporate subsidies and the tariffs that have led to rising \\r\\ngrocery bills for American families. That's not change we can believe in.No problem is more urgent today than America's dependence on foreign oil. It \\r\\nthreatens our security, our economy and our environment. The next President must \\r\\nbe willing to break completely with the energy policies not just of the Bush \\r\\nAdministration, but the administrations that preceded his, and lead a great \\r\\nnational campaign to put us on a course to energy independence. We must unleash \\r\\nthe creativity and genius of Americans, and encourage industries to pursue \\r\\nalternative, non-polluting and renewable energy sources, where demand will never \\r\\nexceed supply.Senator Obama voted for the same policies that created the problem. In fact, he \\r\\nvoted for the energy bill promoted by President Bush and Vice President Cheney, \\r\\nwhich gave even more breaks to the oil industry. I opposed it because I know we \\r\\nwon't achieve energy independence by repeating the mistakes of the last half \\r\\ncentury. That's not change we can believe in.With forward thinking Democrats and Republicans, I proposed a climate change \\r\\npolicy that would greatly reduce our dependence on oil. Our approach was opposed \\r\\nby President Bush, and by leading Democrats, and it was defeated by opposition \\r\\nfrom special interests that favor Republicans and those that favor Democrats. \\r\\nSenator Obama might criticize special interests that give more money to \\r\\nRepublicans. But you won't often see him take on those that favor him. If \\r\\nAmerica is going to achieve energy independence, we need a President with a \\r\\nrecord of putting the nation's interests before the special interests of either \\r\\nparty. I have that record. Senator Obama does not.Senator Obama proposes to keep spending money on programs that make our problems \\r\\nworse and create new ones that are modeled on big government programs that \\r\\ncreated much of the fiscal mess we are in. He plans to pay for these increases \\r\\nby raising taxes on seniors, parents, small business owners and every American \\r\\nwith even a modest investment in the market. He doesn't trust us to make \\r\\ndecisions for ourselves and wants the government to make them for us. And that's \\r\\nnot change we can believe in.Senator Obama thinks we can improve health care by driving Americans into a new \\r\\nsystem of government orders, regulations and mandates. I believe we can make \\r\\nhealth care more available, affordable and responsive to patients by breaking \\r\\nfrom inflationary practices, insurance regulations, and tax policies that were \\r\\ndesigned generations ago, and by giving families more choices over their care. \\r\\nHis plan represents the old ways of government. Mine trusts in the common sense \\r\\nof the American people.Senator Obama pretends we can address the loss of manufacturing jobs by \\r\\nrepealing trade agreements and refusing to sign new ones; that we can build a \\r\\nstronger economy by limiting access to our markets and giving up access to \\r\\nforeign markets. The global economy exists and is not going away. We either \\r\\ncompete in it or we lose more jobs, more businesses, more dreams. We lose the \\r\\nfuture. He's an intelligent man, and he must know how foolish it is to think \\r\\nAmericans can remain prosperous without opening new markets to our goods and \\r\\nservices. But he feels he must defer to the special interests that support him. \\r\\nThat's not change we can believe in.Lowering trade barriers to American goods and services creates more and better \\r\\njobs; keeps inflation under control; keeps interest rates low; and makes more \\r\\ngoods affordable to more Americans. We won't compete successfully by using old \\r\\ntechnology to produce old goods. We'll succeed by knowing what to produce and \\r\\ninventing new technologies to produce it.We are not people who believe only in the survival of the fittest. Work in \\r\\nAmerica is more than a paycheck; it a source of pride, self-reliance and \\r\\nidentity. But making empty promises to bring back lost jobs gives nothing to the \\r\\nunemployed worker except false hope. That's not change we can believe in. \\r\\nReforming from top to bottom unemployment insurance and retraining programs that \\r\\nwere designed for the 1950s, making use of our community colleges to train \\r\\npeople for new opportunities will help workers who've lost a job that won't come \\r\\nback, find a job that won't go away.My friends, we're not a country that would rather go back than forward. We're \\r\\nthe world's leader, and leaders don't hide from history. They make history. But \\r\\nif we're going to lead, we have to reform a government that has lost its ability \\r\\nto help us do so. The solution to our problems isn't to reach back to the 1960s \\r\\nand 70s for answers. In just a few years in office, Senator Obama has \\r\\naccumulated the most liberal voting record in the Senate. But the old, tired, \\r\\nbig government policies he seeks to dust off and call new won't work in a world \\r\\nthat has changed dramatically since they were last tried and failed. That's not \\r\\nchange we can believe in.The sweeping reforms of government we need won't occur unless we change the \\r\\npolitical habits of Washington that have locked us in an endless cycle of \\r\\nbickering and stalemate. Washington is consumed by a hyper-partisanship that \\r\\ntreats every serious issue as an opportunity to trade insults; impugn each \\r\\nother's motives; and fight about the next election. This is the game Washington \\r\\nplays. Both parties play it, as do the special interests that support each side. \\r\\nThe American people know it's not on the level. For all the problems we face, \\r\\nwhat frustrates them most about Washington is they don't think we're capable of \\r\\nserving the public interest before our personal ambitions; that we fight for \\r\\nourselves and not for them. They are sick of the politics of selfishness, \\r\\nstalemate and delay, and they have every right to be. We have to change not only \\r\\ngovernment policies that have failed them, but the political culture that \\r\\nproduced them.Both Senator Obama and I promise we will end Washington's stagnant, unproductive \\r\\npartisanship. But one of us has a record of working to do that and one of us \\r\\ndoesn't. Americans have seen me put aside partisan and personal interests to \\r\\nmove this country forward. They haven't seen Senator Obama do the same. For all \\r\\nhis fine words and all his promise, he has never taken the hard but right course \\r\\nof risking his own interests for yours; of standing against the partisan rancor \\r\\non his side to stand up for our country. He is an impressive man, who makes a \\r\\ngreat first impression. But he hasn't been willing to make the tough calls; to \\r\\nchallenge his party; to risk criticism from his supporters to bring real change \\r\\nto Washington. I have.When members of my party refused to compromise not on principle but for \\r\\npartisanship, I have sought to do so. When I fought corruption it didn't matter \\r\\nto me if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. I exposed it and let the \\r\\nchips fall where they may. When I worked on campaign finance and ethics reform, \\r\\nI did so with Democrats and Republicans, even though we were criticized by other \\r\\nmembers of our parties, who preferred to keep things as they were. I have never \\r\\nrefused to work with Democrats simply for the sake of partisanship. I've always \\r\\nknown we belong to different parties, not different countries. We are Americans \\r\\nbefore we are anything else.I don't seek the presidency on the presumption I'm blessed with such personal \\r\\ngreatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need. I \\r\\nseek the office with the humility of a man who cannot forget my country saved \\r\\nme. I'll reach out my hand to anyone, Republican or Democrat, who will help me \\r\\nchange what needs to be changed; fix what needs to be fixed; and give this \\r\\ncountry a government as capable and good as the people it is supposed to serve. \\r\\nThere is a time to campaign, and a time to govern. If I'm elected President, the \\r\\nera of the permanent campaign of the last sixteen years will end. The era of \\r\\nreform and problem solving will begin. From my first day in office, I'll work \\r\\nwith anyone to make America safe, prosperous and proud. And I won't care who \\r\\ngets the credit as long as America gets the benefit.I have seen Republicans and Democrats achieve great things together. When the \\r\\nstakes were high and it mattered most, I've seen them work together in common \\r\\npurpose, as we did in the weeks after September 11th. This kind of cooperation \\r\\nhas made all the difference at crucial turns in our history. It has given us \\r\\nhope in difficult times. It has moved America forward. And that, my friends, is \\r\\nthe kind of change we need right now.Thank you.\",\n",
       " \"*Ladies and gentlemen: I have come to a decision which I felt I should\\r\\ntell you and all of my fellow American citizens, as soon as I was certain in my own mind\\r\\nand in my own conscience that it is the right thing to do.*I have learned already in this\\r\\noffice that the difficult decisions always come to this desk. I must admit that many of\\r\\nthem do not look at all the same as the hypothetical questions that I have answered freely\\r\\nand perhaps too fast on previous occasions. My customary policy is to try and get all the facts and to consider\\r\\nthe opinions of my countrymen and to take counsel with my most valued friends. But these\\r\\nseldom agree, and in the end, the decision is mine. To procrastinate, to agonize, and to\\r\\nwait for a more favorable turn of events that may never come or more compelling external\\r\\npressures that may as well be wrong as right, is itself a decision of sorts and a weak and\\r\\npotentially dangerous course for a President to follow. I have promised to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as\\r\\nGod gives me to see the right, and to do the very best that I can for America. I have\\r\\nasked your help and your prayers, not only when I became President but many times since.\\r\\nThe Constitution is the supreme law of our land, and it governs our actions as citizens.\\r\\nOnly the laws of God, which govern our consciences, are superior to it. As we are a nation under God, so I am sworn to uphold our laws with\\r\\nthe help of God. And I have sought such guidance and searched my own conscience with\\r\\nspecial diligence to determine the right thing for me to do with respect to my predecessor\\r\\nin this place, Richard Nixon, and his loyal wife and family. Theirs is an American tragedy\\r\\nin which we all -- all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write\\r\\nthe end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must. There are no historic or legal precedents to which I can turn in\\r\\nthis matter, none that precisely fit the circumstances of a private citizen who has\\r\\nresigned the Presidency of the United States. But it is common knowledge that serious\\r\\nallegations and accusations hang like a sword over our former President's head,\\r\\nthreatening his health as he tries to reshape his life, a great part of which was spent in\\r\\nthe service of this country and by the mandate of its people. After years of bitter controversy and divisive national debate, I\\r\\nhave been advised, and I am compelled to conclude that many months and perhaps more years\\r\\nwill have to pass before Richard Nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in any\\r\\njurisdiction of the United States under governing decisions of the Supreme Court. I deeply\\r\\nbelieve in equal justice for all Americans, whatever their station or former station. The\\r\\nlaw, whether human or divine, is no respecter of persons; but the law is a respecter of\\r\\nreality. The facts, as I see them, are that a former President of the United\\r\\nStates, instead of enjoying equal treatment with any other citizen accused of violating\\r\\nthe law, would be cruelly and excessively penalized either in preserving the presumption\\r\\nof his innocence or in obtaining a speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay a\\r\\nlegal debt to society. During this long period of delay and potential litigation, ugly\\r\\npassions would again be aroused. And our people would again be polarized in their\\r\\nopinions. And the credibility of our free institutions of government would again be\\r\\nchallenged at home and abroad. In the end, the courts might well hold that Richard Nixon\\r\\nhad been denied due process, and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusive\\r\\nwith respect to those charges arising out of the period of his Presidency, of which I am\\r\\npresently aware. But it is not the ultimate fate of Richard Nixon that most concerns\\r\\nme, though surely it deeply troubles every decent and every compassionate person. My\\r\\nconcern is the immediate future of this great country. In this, I dare not depend upon my\\r\\npersonal sympathy as a long-time friend of the former President, nor my professional\\r\\njudgment as a lawyer, and I do not. As President, my primary concern must always be the greatest good of\\r\\nall the people of the United States whose servant I am. As a man, my first consideration\\r\\nis to be true to my own convictions and my own conscience. My conscience tells me clearly\\r\\nand certainly that I cannot prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that\\r\\nis closed. My conscience tells me that only I, as President, have the constitutional power\\r\\nto firmly shut and seal this book. My conscience tells me it is my duty, not merely to\\r\\nproclaim domestic tranquility but to use every means that I have to insure it. I do believe that the buck stops here, that I cannot rely upon\\r\\npublic opinion polls to tell me what is right. I do believe that right makes might and that if I am wrong, 10\\r\\nangels swearing I was right would make no difference. I do believe, with all my heart and mind and spirit, that I, not as\\r\\nPresident but as a humble servant of God, will receive justice without mercy if I fail to\\r\\nshow mercy. Finally, I feel that Richard Nixon and his loved ones have suffered\\r\\nenough and will continue to suffer, no matter what I do, no matter what we, as a great and\\r\\ngood nation, can do together to make his goal of peace come true.  Now, therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States,\\r\\npursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2,\\r\\nof the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full,\\r\\nfree, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the\\r\\nUnited States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have\\r\\ncommitted or taken part in during the period from July 20,\\r\\n1969 through August 9, 1974.*In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of\\r\\nSeptember, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four,\\r\\nand of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred\\xa0and ninety-ninth.*\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, my \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends. Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening. My friends, we have -- we \\r\\n\\t\\thave come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, \\r\\n\\t\\tand they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I \\r\\n\\t\\thad the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him -- \\r\\n\\t\\tplease -- to congratulate him on being \\r\\n\\t\\telected the next President of the country that we both love. In a contest as long and \\r\\n\\t\\tdifficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my \\r\\n\\t\\trespect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so \\r\\n\\t\\tby inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once \\r\\n\\t\\twrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe election of an American president is something I deeply admire and \\r\\n\\t\\tcommend him for achieving. This is an historic \\r\\n\\t\\telection, and I recognize the special significance it has for \\r\\n\\t\\tAfrican-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to \\r\\n\\t\\tseize it. Senator Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that, \\r\\n\\t\\tthough we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained \\r\\n\\t\\tour nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound. A century ago, President \\r\\n\\t\\tTheodore Roosevelt's invitation ofBooker T. Washingtonto -- to dine at the \\r\\n\\t\\tWhite House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world \\r\\n\\t\\taway from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now \\r\\n\\t\\t-- Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the \\r\\n\\t\\tgreatest nation on Earth. Senator Obama has achieved a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and \\r\\n\\t\\toffer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live \\r\\n\\t\\tto see this day. Though our faith assures us she is at rest in the \\r\\n\\t\\tpresence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped \\r\\n\\t\\traise. Senator Obama and I have had \\r\\n\\t\\tand argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferences remain. These are difficult times \\r\\n\\t\\tfor our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp him lead us through the many challenges we face. I urge all Americans \\r\\n\\t\\t-- I urge all Americans who \\r\\n\\t\\tsupported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our \\r\\n\\t\\tnext president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and \\r\\n\\t\\thelp restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, \\r\\n\\t\\tand leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than \\r\\n\\t\\twe inherited. Whatever our differences, we \\r\\n\\t\\tare fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association \\r\\n\\t\\thas ever meant more to me than that. It is natural -- It's \\r\\n\\t\\tnatural, tonight, to feel some disappointment. But tomorrow, we must \\r\\n\\t\\tmove beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought -- We fought as \\r\\n\\t\\thard as we could. And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not \\r\\n\\t\\tyours. I am so -- I am so deeply grateful to \\r\\n\\t\\tall of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done \\r\\n\\t\\tfor me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot \\r\\n\\t\\tadequately express how deeply I -- indebted I am to you. I'm especially grateful to \\r\\n\\t\\tmy wife, Cindy, my children, my dear mother -- my dear mother, and all my family, and to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many \\r\\n\\t\\tups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a \\r\\n\\t\\tfortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have \\r\\n\\t\\tgiven me. You know, campaigns are \\r\\n\\t\\toften harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen true in this campaign. All I can offer in \\r\\n\\t\\tcompensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ahead. I am also -- I am also, of \\r\\n\\t\\tcourse, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin, one of the best campaigners \\r\\n\\t\\tI have ever seen -- one of the best campaigners I have ever seen, and an impressive new voice in our \\r\\n\\t\\tParty for reform and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe principles that have always been our greatest strength, her husband \\r\\n\\t\\tTodd and their five beautiful children for their tireless dedication to \\r\\n\\t\\tour cause, and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble \\r\\n\\t\\tof a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party, and \\r\\n\\t\\tour country. To all my campaign comrades, \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, to every last \\r\\n\\t\\tvolunteer who fought so hard and valiantly, month after month, in what \\r\\n\\t\\tat times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times, \\r\\n\\t\\tthank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivilege of your faith and friendship. I don't know -- I don't know \\r\\n\\t\\twhat more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave \\r\\n\\t\\tthat to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm \\r\\n\\t\\tsure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future \\r\\n\\t\\tregretting what might have been. This campaign was and will \\r\\n\\t\\tremain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing \\r\\n\\t\\tbut gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving \\r\\n\\t\\tme a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator \\r\\n\\t\\tJoe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years. (Please -- please) I would not -- I would not \\r\\n\\t\\tbe an -- an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has \\r\\n\\t\\tallowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a \\r\\n\\t\\thalf a century. Today, I was a candidate for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain \\r\\n\\t\\ther servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people \\r\\n\\t\\tof Arizona for it. Tonight -- Tonight, more \\r\\n\\t\\tthan any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and \\r\\n\\t\\tfor all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama -- \\r\\n\\t\\twhether they supported me or Senator Obama -- I wish Godspeed to the man \\r\\n\\t\\twho was my former opponent and will be my President. And I call on all \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe, always, in the promise and \\r\\n\\t\\tgreatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We \\r\\n\\t\\tnever surrender. We never hide from history. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe make history. Thank you, and God bless \\r\\n\\t\\tyou, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. President, it is a year \\r\\n\\t\\tago this month that the late President Kennedy sent his civil rights \\r\\n\\t\\tbill and message to the Congress. For two years, we had been chiding him \\r\\n\\t\\tabout failure to act in this field. At long last, and after many \\r\\n\\t\\tconferences, it became a reality. After nine days of hearings \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, it was referred to a \\r\\n\\t\\tsubcommittee. There it languished and the administration leadership \\r\\n\\t\\tfinally decided to await the House bill. In the House it traveled an \\r\\n\\t\\tequally tortuous road. But at long last, it reached the House floor for \\r\\n\\t\\taction. It was debated for 64 hours; 155 amendments were offered; 34 \\r\\n\\t\\twere approved. On February 10, 1964, it passed the House by a vote of \\r\\n\\t\\t290 to 130. That was a 65-percent vote. It was messaged to the \\r\\n\\t\\tSenate on February 17 and reached the Senate calendar on February 26. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe motion to take up and consider was made on March 9. That motion was \\r\\n\\t\\tdebated for sixteen days and on March 26 by a vote of 67 to 17 it was \\r\\n\\t\\tadopted. It is now 4 months since it \\r\\n\\t\\tpassed the House. It is 3½ months since it came to the Senate calendar. \\r\\n\\t\\tThree months have gone by since the motion to consider was made. We have \\r\\n\\t\\tacted on one intervening motion to send the bill back to the Judiciary \\r\\n\\t\\tCommittee and a vote on the jury trial amendment. That has been the \\r\\n\\t\\textent of our action. Sharp opinions have \\r\\n\\t\\tdeveloped. Incredible allegations have been made. Extreme views have \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen asserted. The mail volume has been heavy. The bill has provoked \\r\\n\\t\\tmany long-distance telephone calls, many of them late at night or in the \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall hours of the morning. There has been unrestrained criticism about \\r\\n\\t\\tmotives. Thousands of people have come to the Capitol to urge immediate \\r\\n\\t\\taction on an unchanged House bill. For myself, I have had but \\r\\n\\t\\tone purpose and that was the enactment of a good, workable, equitable, \\r\\n\\t\\tpractical bill having due regard for the progress made in the civil \\r\\n\\t\\trights field at the state and local level. I am no Johnnie-come-lately \\r\\n\\t\\tin this field. Thirty years ago, in the House of Representatives, I \\r\\n\\t\\tvoted on anti-poll tax and anti- lynching measures. Since then, I have \\r\\n\\t\\tsponsored or cosponsored scores of bills dealing with civil rights. At the outset, I contended \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the House bill was imperfect and deficient. That fact is now quite \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerally conceded. But the debate continued. The number of amendments \\r\\n\\t\\tsubmitted increased. They now number nearly four hundred. The stalemate \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinued. A backlog of work piled up. Committees could not function \\r\\n\\t\\tnormally. It was an unhappy situation and it was becoming a bit \\r\\n\\t\\tintolerable. It became increasingly \\r\\n\\t\\tevident that to secure passage of a bill in the Senate would require \\r\\n\\t\\tcloture and a limitation on debate. Senate aversion to cloture is \\r\\n\\t\\ttraditional. Only once in thirty-five years has cloture been voted. But \\r\\n\\t\\tthe procedure for cloture is a standing rule of the Senate. It grew out \\r\\n\\t\\tof a filibuster against the Armed Ship bill in 1917 and has been part of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe standing rules of the Senate for forty- seven years. To argue that \\r\\n\\t\\tcloture is unwarranted or unjustified is to assert that in 1917, the \\r\\n\\t\\tSenate adopted a rule which it did not intend to use when circumstances \\r\\n\\t\\trequired or that it was placed in the rulebook only as to be repudiated. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt was adopted as an instrument for action when all other efforts \\r\\n\\t\\tfailed. Today the Senate is \\r\\n\\t\\tstalemated in its efforts to enact a civil rights bill, one version of \\r\\n\\t\\twhich has already been approved by the House by a vote of more than 2 to \\r\\n\\t\\t1. That the Senate wishes to act on a civil rights bill can be divined \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the fact that the motion to take up was adopted by a vote of 67 to \\r\\n\\t\\t17. Reasons for cloture on civil \\r\\n\\t\\trights There are many reasons why cloture should be invoked and a good \\r\\n\\t\\tcivil rights measure enacted. First. It is said that on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe night he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, substantially this \\r\\n\\t\\tsentiment: Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come. The time has come for \\r\\n\\t\\tequality of opportunity in sharing in government, in education, and in \\r\\n\\t\\temployment. It will not be stayed or denied. It is here. The problem began when the \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitution makers permitted the importation of persons to continue for \\r\\n\\t\\tanother twenty years. That problem was to generate the fury of civil \\r\\n\\t\\tstrife seventy-five years later. Out of it was to come the Thirteenth \\r\\n\\t\\tAmendment ending servitude, the Fourteenth Amendment to provide equal \\r\\n\\t\\tprotection of the laws and dual citizenship, the Fifteenth Amendment to \\r\\n\\t\\tprohibit government from abridging the right to vote. Other factors had an impact. \\r\\n\\t\\tTwo and three-quarter million young Negroes served in World Wars I, II, \\r\\n\\t\\tand Korea. Some won the Congressional Medal of Honor and the \\r\\n\\t\\tDistinguished Service Cross. Today they are fathers and grandfathers. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey brought back impressions from countries where no discrimination \\r\\n\\t\\texisted. These impressions have been transmitted to children and \\r\\n\\t\\tgrandchildren. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of colored have become \\r\\n\\t\\tteachers and professors, doctors and dentists, engineers and architects, \\r\\n\\t\\tartists and actors, musicians and technicians. They have become status \\r\\n\\t\\tminded. They have sensed inequality. They are prepared to make the \\r\\n\\t\\tissue. They feel that the time has come for the idea of equal \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity. To enact the pending measure by invoking cloture is \\r\\n\\t\\timperative. Years ago, a professor who \\r\\n\\t\\tthought he had developed an uncontrovertible scientific premise \\r\\n\\t\\tsubmitted it to his faculty associates. Quickly they picked it apart. In \\r\\n\\t\\tagony he cried out, \"Is nothing eternal?\" To this one of his associates \\r\\n\\t\\treplied, \"Nothing is eternal except change.\" Since the act of 1875 on \\r\\n\\t\\tpublic accommodations and the Supreme Court decision of 1883 which \\r\\n\\t\\tstruck it down, America has changed. The population then was 45 million. \\r\\n\\t\\tToday it is 190 million. In the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag we \\r\\n\\t\\tintone, \"One nation, under God.\" And so it is. It is an integrated \\r\\n\\t\\tnation. Air, rail, and highway transportation make it so. A common \\r\\n\\t\\tlanguage makes it so. A tax pattern which applies equally to white and \\r\\n\\t\\tnonwhite makes it so. Literacy makes it so. The mobility provided by \\r\\n\\t\\teighty million autos makes it so. The accommodations laws in thirty-four \\r\\n\\t\\tstates and the District of Columbia makes it so. The fair employment \\r\\n\\t\\tpractice laws in thirty states make it so. Yes, our land has changed \\r\\n\\t\\tsince the Supreme Court decision of 1883. As Lincoln once observed: The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must first disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save the Union. To my friends from the \\r\\n\\t\\tSouth, I would refresh you on the words of a great Georgian named Henry \\r\\n\\t\\tW. Grady. On December 22, 1886, he was asked to respond to a toast to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe new South at the New England society dinner. His words were dramatic \\r\\n\\t\\tand explosive. He began his toast by saying: There was a South of slavery and secession -- that South is dead. There is a South of union and freedom -- that South thank God is living, breathing, growing every hour. America grows. America \\r\\n\\t\\tchanges. And on the civil rights issue we must rise with the occasion. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat calls for cloture and for the enactment of a civil rights bill. Third. There is another \\r\\n\\t\\treason -- our covenant with the people. For many years, each political \\r\\n\\t\\tparty has given major consideration to a civil rights plank in its \\r\\n\\t\\tplatform. Go back and reexamine our pledges to the country as we sought \\r\\n\\t\\tthe suffrage of the people and for a grant of authority to manage and \\r\\n\\t\\tdirect their affairs. Were these pledges so much campaign stuff or did \\r\\n\\t\\twe mean it? Were these promises on civil rights but idle words for \\r\\n\\t\\tvote-getting purposes or were they a covenant meant to be kept? If all \\r\\n\\t\\tthis was mere pretense, let us confess the sin of hypocrisy now and vow \\r\\n\\t\\tnot to delude the people again. To you, my Republican \\r\\n\\t\\tcolleagues, let me refresh you on the words of a great American. His \\r\\n\\t\\tname is Herbert Hoover. In his day he was reviled and maligned. He was \\r\\n\\t\\tcastigated and calumniated. But today his views and his judgment stand \\r\\n\\t\\tvindicated at the bar of history. In 1952 he received a volcanic welcome \\r\\n\\t\\tas he appeared before our national convention in Chicago. On that \\r\\n\\t\\toccasion he commented on the Whig party, predecessor of the Republican \\r\\n\\t\\tparty, and said: The Whig party temporized, compromised upon the issue of freedom for the Negro. That party disappeared. It deserved to disappear. Shall the Republican party receive or deserve any better fate if it compromises upon the issue of freedom for all men? To those who have charged me \\r\\n\\t\\twith doing a disservice to my party because of my interest in the \\r\\n\\t\\tenactment of a good civil rights bill -- and there have been a good many \\r\\n\\t\\twho have made that charge -- I can only say that our party found its \\r\\n\\t\\tfaith in the Declaration of Independence in which a great Democrat, \\r\\n\\t\\tJefferson by name, wrote the flaming words: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. That has been the living \\r\\n\\t\\tfaith of our party. Do we forsake this article of faith, now that \\r\\n\\t\\tequality\\'s time has come or do we stand up for it and insure the \\r\\n\\t\\tsurvival of our party and its ultimate victory. There is no substitute \\r\\n\\t\\tfor a basic and righteous idea. We have a duty -- a firm duty -- to use the \\r\\n\\t\\tinstruments at hand -- namely, the cloture rule -- to bring about the \\r\\n\\t\\tenactment of a good civil rights bill. Fourth. There is another \\r\\n\\t\\treason why we dare not temporize with the issue which is before us. It \\r\\n\\t\\tis essentially moral in character. It must be resolved. It will not go \\r\\n\\t\\taway. Its time has come. Nor is it the first time in our history that an \\r\\n\\t\\tissue with moral connotations and implications has swept away the \\r\\n\\t\\tresistance, the fulminations, the legalistic speeches, the ardent but \\r\\n\\t\\tdubious arguments, the lamentations and the thought patterns of an \\r\\n\\t\\tearlier generation and pushed forward to fruition. More than sixty years ago \\r\\n\\t\\tcame the first efforts to secure federal pure food and drug legislation. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe speeches made on this floor against this intrusion of federal power \\r\\n\\t\\tsound fantastically incredible today. But it would not be stayed. Its \\r\\n\\t\\ttime had come and since its enactment, it has been expanded and \\r\\n\\t\\tstrengthened in nearly every Congress. When the first efforts were \\r\\n\\t\\tmade to ban the shipment of goods in interstate commerce made with child \\r\\n\\t\\tlabor, it was regarded as quite absurd. But all the trenchant \\r\\n\\t\\teditorials, the bitter speeches, the noisy onslaughts were swept aside \\r\\n\\t\\tas this limitation on the shipment of goods made with sweated child \\r\\n\\t\\tlabor moved on to fulfillment. Its time had come. More than eighty years ago \\r\\n\\t\\tcame the first efforts to establish a civil service and merit system to \\r\\n\\t\\tcover federal employees. The proposal was ridiculed and drenched with \\r\\n\\t\\tsarcasm. Some of the sharpest attacks on the proposal were made on this \\r\\n\\t\\tvery Senate floor. But the bullet fired by a disappointed office seeker \\r\\n\\t\\tin 1880 which took President Garfield\\'s life was the instrument of \\r\\n\\t\\tdestiny which placed the Pendleton Act on the federal statute books in \\r\\n\\t\\t1883. It was an idea whose time had come. When the New York \\r\\n\\t\\tlegislature placed a limit of ten hours per day and six days per week \\r\\n\\t\\tupon the bakery workers in that State, this act was struck down by the \\r\\n\\t\\tU.S. Supreme Court. But in due time came the eight-hour day and the \\r\\n\\t\\tforty-hour week and how broadly accepted this concept is today. Its time \\r\\n\\t\\thad come. More than sixty years ago, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe elder La Follette thundered against the election of U.S. senators by \\r\\n\\t\\tthe state legislatures. The cry was to get back to the people and to \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst principles. On this Senate floor, senators sneered at his efforts \\r\\n\\t\\tand even left the chamber to show their contempt. But fifty years ago, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Constitution was amended to provide for the direct election of \\r\\n\\t\\tsenators. Its time had come. Ninety-five years ago came \\r\\n\\t\\tthe first endeavor to remove the limitation on sex in the exercise of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe franchise. The comments made in those early days sound unbelievably \\r\\n\\t\\tludicrous. But on and on went the effort and became the Nineteenth \\r\\n\\t\\tAmendment to the Constitution. Its time had come. When the eminent Joseph \\r\\n\\t\\tChoate appeared before the Supreme Court to assert that a federal income \\r\\n\\t\\ttax statute was unconstitutional and communistic, the Court struck down \\r\\n\\t\\tthe work of Congress. Just twenty years later in 1913 the power of \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress to lay and collect taxes on incomes became the Sixteenth \\r\\n\\t\\tAmendment to the Constitution itself. These are but some of the \\r\\n\\t\\tthings touching closely the affairs of the people which were met with \\r\\n\\t\\tstout resistance, with shrill and strident cries of radicalism, with \\r\\n\\t\\tstrained legalisms, with anguished entreaties that the foundations of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Republic were being rocked. But an inexorable moral force which \\r\\n\\t\\toperates in the domain of human affairs swept these efforts aside and \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday they are accepted as parts of the social, economic and political \\r\\n\\t\\tfabric of America. Pending before us is another \\r\\n\\t\\tmoral issue. Basically it deals with equality of opportunity in \\r\\n\\t\\texercising the franchise, in securing an education, in making a \\r\\n\\t\\tlivelihood, in enjoying the mantle of protection of the law. It has been \\r\\n\\t\\ta long, hard furrow and each generation must plow its share. Progress \\r\\n\\t\\twas made in 1957 and 1960. But the furrow does not end there. It \\r\\n\\t\\trequires the implementation provided by the substitute measure which is \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore us. And to secure that implementation requires cloture. Let me add one thought to \\r\\n\\t\\tthese observations. Today is an anniversary. It is in fact the one \\r\\n\\t\\thundredth anniversary of the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for a second \\r\\n\\t\\tterm for the presidency on the Republican ticket. Two documents became \\r\\n\\t\\tthe blueprints for his life and his conduct. The first was the \\r\\n\\t\\tDeclaration of Independence which proclaimed the doctrine that all men \\r\\n\\t\\tare created equal. The second was the Constitution, the preamble to \\r\\n\\t\\twhich began with the words: We, the people...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. These were the articles of \\r\\n\\t\\this superb and unquenchable faith. Nowhere and at no time did he more \\r\\n\\t\\tnobly reaffirm that faith than at Gettysburg 101 years ago when he spoke \\r\\n\\t\\tof \"a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition \\r\\n\\t\\tthat all men are created equal.\" It is to take us further \\r\\n\\t\\tdown that road that a bill is pending before us. We have a duty to get \\r\\n\\t\\tthat job done. To do it will require cloture and a limitation on debate \\r\\n\\t\\tas provided by a standing rule of the Senate which has been in being for \\r\\n\\t\\tnearly fifty years. I trust we shall not fail in that duty. That, from a great \\r\\n\\t\\tRepublican, thinking in the frame of equality of opportunity -- and that \\r\\n\\t\\tis all that is involved in this bill. To those who have charged me \\r\\n\\t\\twith doing a disservice to my party -- and there have been many -- I can \\r\\n\\t\\tonly say that our party found its faith in the Declaration of \\r\\n\\t\\tIndependence, which was penned by a great Democrat, Thomas Jefferson by \\r\\n\\t\\tname. There he wrote the great words: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That has been the living \\r\\n\\t\\tfaith of our party. Do we forsake this article of faith, now that the \\r\\n\\t\\ttime for our decision has come? There is no substitute for a \\r\\n\\t\\tbasic ideal. We have a firm duty to use the instrument at hand; namely, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe cloture rule, to bring about the enactment of a good civil rights \\r\\n\\t\\tbill. I appeal to all senators. We \\r\\n\\t\\tare confronted with a moral issue. Today let us not be found wanting in \\r\\n\\t\\twhatever it takes by way of moral and spiritual substance to face up to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe issue and to vote cloture.',\n",
       " 'Today is a special day for me and I remember a number of weeks ago when \\r\\n\\t\\tSenator Abraham and I discussed the possibility of awarding aCongressional Gold MedaltoRosa Parks. It was an idea that we thought \\r\\n\\t\\twas a good one, and I\\'m glad to see it moving rapidly to fruition.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tI certainly believe that the Congressional Gold Medal is a very \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinguished award that ought to be preserved for the most exceptional \\r\\n\\t\\tcircumstances and persons, and I certainly believe the one today that we \\r\\n\\t\\twill honor meets all the qualities. So I am pleased to honor a native Alabamian who, through her life and \\r\\n\\t\\tthrough her example, has touched both the heart and conscience of an \\r\\n\\t\\tentire nation. I speak, of course, of Ms. Rosa Parks, a native of \\r\\n\\t\\tTuskegee and a former resident of Montgomery whose dignity in the face \\r\\n\\t\\tof discrimination helped spark a movement to ensure that all citizens \\r\\n\\t\\twere treated equally under the law. Equal treatment under the law is a \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental pillar upon which our Republic rests. In fact, over the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst two months of this year, this Senate was engaged in a \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitutional debate over the scope and meaning of this very concept. As \\r\\n\\t\\tlegislators we should work to strengthen the appreciation for this \\r\\n\\t\\timportant, fundamental governing principle by recognizing those who make \\r\\n\\t\\textraordinary contributions towards ensuring that all American citizens \\r\\n\\t\\thave the...opportunity, regardless of their race, sex, or creed, or national \\r\\n\\t\\torigin, to enjoy the freedoms that this country has to offer. Through her efforts, Mrs. Parks has come to be a living embodiment of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis principle, and it is entirely appropriate that this Congress take \\r\\n\\t\\tthis opportunity to acknowledge her contribution by authorizing the \\r\\n\\t\\taward of a Congressional gold medal to her. Her courage, what we may \\r\\n\\t\\tcall \"gumption,\" resulted in historic change. Certainly there is much \\r\\n\\t\\tstill to be done. True equality, the total elimination of \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscrimination, and a real sense of ease and acceptance among the races \\r\\n\\t\\thas not yet been fully achieved. But it is fair to say that in the history of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis effort, the most dramatic and productive chapter was ignited by the \\r\\n\\t\\tlady we seek to honor today. Mrs. Parks\\' story is well known, but it bears repeating. She was born on \\r\\n\\t\\tFebruary 4th, 1913, in the small town of Alabama -- Tuskegee, Alabama, to Mr. James and \\r\\n\\t\\tMrs. Leona McCauley. As a young child, she moved to Montgomery with her \\r\\n\\t\\tmother, who was a local schoolteacher. Like many Southern cities, [the] \\r\\n\\t\\tMontgomery of Mrs. Parks\\' youth was a segregated city with a [sic] numerous laws \\r\\n\\t\\tmandating the separate and unequal treatment of people based solely upon the color of their \\r\\n\\t\\tskin. These laws were discriminatory [in their] intent, and divisive, \\r\\n\\t\\tunfair, and humiliating in their application. But for years Mrs. Parks had \\r\\n\\t\\tsuffered with them until that fateful day ofDecember 1, 1955, when her \\r\\n\\t\\tpride and\\xa0 dignity would not allow her to obey them any more.  On this day \\r\\n\\t\\tMrs. Parks, a 42 year old seamstress, boarded a city bus after a long, \\r\\n\\t\\thard day at work. Like other public accommodations, this bus contained \\r\\n\\t\\tseparate sections for white passengers and black passengers. White passengers \\r\\n\\t\\twere allocated the front rows. The black passengers were given the back \\r\\n\\t\\trows. This bus \\r\\n\\t\\twas particularly crowded that evening. At one of the stops, a white \\r\\n\\t\\tpassenger boarded, and the bus driver, seeing Mrs. Parks, requested that \\r\\n\\t\\tshe give up her seat and move to the back of the bus, even though this \\r\\n\\t\\tmeant that she would be forced to stand for the rest of the trip. Mrs. \\r\\n\\t\\tParks refused to give up her seat and was arrested for disobeying the \\r\\n\\t\\tbus drivers order. For her act of civic defiance, Mrs. Parks set off a chain of events that \\r\\n\\t\\thave led some to refer to her as the \"Mother of the Civil Rights \\r\\n\\t\\tMovement.\" Her arrest led to theMontgomery Bus Boycott, an organized \\r\\n\\t\\tmovement led by a young minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., who had \\r\\n\\t\\tbegun preaching at thehistoric Baptist churchlocated on Montgomery\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tDexter Avenue. The bus boycott lasted 382 days, and its impact directly \\r\\n\\t\\tled to the integration of bus lines while the attention generated \\r\\n\\t\\thelped lift Dr. King to national prominence. Ultimately, the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates Supreme Court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of the \\r\\n\\t\\tMontgomery law, which Mrs. Parks had defied, and the court struck it down.2  That --\\r\\n\\t\\tThis powerful image, that of a hard working American ordered to the back \\r\\n\\t\\tof the bus just because of her race, was a catalytic event. It was the spark that caused a nation \\r\\n\\t\\tto stop accepting things as they had been and focused everyone on the \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental issue: whether we could continue as a segregated society. As \\r\\n\\t\\ta result of the movement Mrs. Parks helped start, today\\'s Montgomery is \\r\\n\\t\\ta quite different city from the one of her youth. Today, the \\r\\n\\t\\tcitizens of Montgomery look with a great deal of historical pride upon \\r\\n\\t\\tthe church that once heard the sermons of Dr. King.  Montgomery is the \\r\\n\\t\\thome of theCivil Rights Memorial, a striking monument of black granite \\r\\n\\t\\tand cascading water which memorializes the individuals who gave their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives in pursuit of equal justice. Today\\'s Montgomery is a city in which its history as the \"Capital of the \\r\\n\\t\\tConfederacy\" and its history as the \"Birthplace of the Civil Rights \\r\\n\\t\\tMovement\" are both recognized and reconciled.  And soon, Troy State \\r\\n\\t\\tUniversity of Montgomery will become the home of the \"Rosa Parks Library \\r\\n\\t\\tand Museum\" built on the very spot upon which Mrs. Parks was arrested in \\r\\n\\t\\t1955, the old Empire Theater. So\\r\\n\\t\\tI would like to briefly describe this \\r\\n\\t\\timportant project. Troy State University Montgomery is an important \\r\\n\\t\\tuniversity with over 3,400 full time students. They are in -- in the midst of \\r\\n\\t\\tconstructing a 50,000 square foot library and museum on the land they \\r\\n\\t\\town, which includes the exact location where Mrs. Parks was arrested in \\r\\n\\t\\t1955. When completed, this museum will include a 3,700 square foot \\r\\n\\t\\tpermanent exhibit focusing on the commemoration of the Montgomery Civil \\r\\n\\t\\tRights Movement. This project memorializes an historic event that changed \\r\\n\\t\\tthe city of Montgomery for the better, and I look forward to offering \\r\\n\\t\\tany support I can to aid in its completion. Mrs. Parks\\' efforts helped spark the dynamic social changes which have \\r\\n\\t\\tmade it possible for this kind of recognition to be supported by \\r\\n\\t\\tMontgomerians and Alabamians. But, in fact, Ms. Parks\\' contributions may \\r\\n\\t\\textend beyond even the borders of our nation. In his book,Bus Ride to \\r\\n\\t\\tJustice,Mr. Fred Gray, who gained fame while in his 20s as Ms. Parks\\' \\r\\n\\t\\tattorney in the bus desegregation case, and one of the early \\r\\n\\t\\tAfrican-American attorneys in Alabama -- and he was the lead attorney in many \\r\\n\\t\\tof Alabama\\'s other famous civil rights cases -- he wrote in his book, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I do not believe it is an exaggeration, these words (quote): Little did we know that we had set in motion a force that would ripple \\r\\n\\t\\tthroughout Alabama, the South, and the nation, and even the world. But from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe vantage point of almost 40 years later, there is a direct \\r\\n\\t\\tcorrelation between what we started in Montgomery and what has \\r\\n\\t\\tsubsequently happened in China, eastern Europe, South Africa and [even] \\r\\n\\t\\tmore recently, even in Russia. While it is inaccurate to say that we all sat \\r\\n\\t\\tdown and deliberately planned a movement that would echo and reverberate \\r\\n\\t\\taround the world, we did work around the clock, planning strategy and \\r\\n\\t\\tcreating an atmosphere that gave strength, courage, faith and hope to \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople of all races, creeds, colors and religions around the world. And \\r\\n\\t\\tit all started on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, with Rosa Parks on \\r\\n\\t\\tDecember 1, 1955.3 For her courage, for her role in changing Alabama, the South, the \\r\\n\\t\\tnation, and the world for the better, our nation owes a great debt of \\r\\n\\t\\tthanks to Rosa \\r\\n\\t\\tParks. I hope that this body will extend its thanks and recognition to \\r\\n\\t\\ther by awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal.',\n",
       " 'Good morning. I\\'m going to try to \\r\\n\\t\\tanswer the question: How is it that a person generally seen particularly \\r\\n\\t\\tby the press as eloquent during the campaign, is now seen as largely \\r\\n\\t\\trhetorically unsuccessful or at least less eloquent than he was seen \\r\\n\\t\\tduring the campaign? And I\\'m going to \\r\\n\\t\\targue that during the campaign what Barack Obama offered the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople was classic epideictic in the Greek sense. A rhetoric that \\r\\n\\t\\tcreated a sense of collective community grounded in hope and a sense of \\r\\n\\t\\treconciliation embodied in who he was as an individual and in that \\r\\n\\t\\tmessage. That\\'s been, that \\r\\n\\t\\tconcept isn\\'t new or controversial, I\\'m just going to assume that you\\'ll \\r\\n\\t\\taccept it on its face. But the point I want to make to -- to, about it \\r\\n\\t\\tis that the credibility of Barack Obama, an African-American winning the \\r\\n\\t\\tprimary in Iowa, giving this sort of message, meant that we were \\r\\n\\t\\tinvesting that message with Barack Obama. He became the evidence for his \\r\\n\\t\\town message. And at a time in which the public was widely ready to \\r\\n\\t\\trepudiate George Bush, he became the incarnation of everyone\\'s hopes and \\r\\n\\t\\tdreams as the \"un-Bush.\" As a result people \\r\\n\\t\\tread into his candidacy whatever they wanted, particularly everything \\r\\n\\t\\tthey didn\\'t like about George Bush. And every unfulfilled aspiration of \\r\\n\\t\\tliberals or progressives was also bodied in this person Barack Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tregardless of what he actually said. In other words Barack \\r\\n\\t\\tObama was never as eloquent as we thought he was. A person matched a \\r\\n\\t\\tmoment with a rhetoric in a context in which the audience created \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething it heard as eloquence. Widely labeled as \\r\\n\\t\\teloquent, he creates expectations for his presidency that he cannot \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfy in the presidency barring that he is Abraham Lincoln with TheGettysburg Addressor aSecond Inauguralin his pocket. And that\\'s my first \\r\\n\\t\\targument. He comes in with expectations that he and the press and we \\r\\n\\t\\tcollectively created that are virtually unmeetable. That said, by \\r\\n\\t\\thistorical standards this is not particularly effective rhetoric. I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\tdrawing up from concepts thatKarlyn Campbelland I articulated in a \\r\\n\\t\\tbook calledPresidents Creating the Presidency, Deeds done in Words, \\r\\n\\t\\tpublished by University of Chicago Press. And I\\'m going to make three \\r\\n\\t\\targuments. First, in the modern \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidency candidates don\\'t actually give us speech anymore and when we \\r\\n\\t\\tlook at a speech we misunderstand what they\\'re doing. They give a series \\r\\n\\t\\tof rhetorical offerings to the American people, that taken together \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause they focus on some particular moment or some particular topic, \\r\\n\\t\\tfocus our attention on central meaning and as result lead us to come to \\r\\n\\t\\ta speech with a context already set. And in that context they should \\r\\n\\t\\toffer us a digestive understanding of who we are at that moment and how \\r\\n\\t\\tthat individual is going to take us into the future that person has \\r\\n\\t\\toffered us. Now a rhetoric that \\r\\n\\t\\tsimply promises hope is going to be inadequate because we\\'re looking for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe specifics that are going to be delivered, tied to a compelling and \\r\\n\\t\\tcoherent vision, digested in language that we can understand and, \\r\\n\\t\\timportantly, remember. The Barack Obama that \\r\\n\\t\\twe see in the presidency is actually very good at setting up the moments \\r\\n\\t\\tthat lead to the speech. He just isn\\'t very good at delivering the \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech. Barack Obama actually \\r\\n\\t\\tgave his best inaugural address, not when he stood before the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople and swore the oath of office. He gave it in the week coming up to \\r\\n\\t\\tthat point, as they were setting up the inaugural address, when he gave \\r\\n\\t\\taspeech at the Mallthat reads more effectively than the Inaugural \\r\\n\\t\\tAddress itself. In other words, the pre-speech, the part of the \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild-up, actually exhausted the rhetoric that should have been in the \\r\\n\\t\\tinaugural or they should have simply lifted that speech and given it to \\r\\n\\t\\tan audience large enough to have heard it. There were probably if twenty \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople in Washington who still remember the speech that he gave leading \\r\\n\\t\\tup and I bet most of them would say if asked, it was better than the \\r\\n\\t\\tInaugural Address. He is good at \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild-up, yet when he went down to give the build-up for the first of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe two speeches in the Oval Office, he empathizes with the people who \\r\\n\\t\\tare in the Gulf. He meets with them, we get the visuals which a speech \\r\\n\\t\\tshould then recap and bring forward to us, but which actually the speech \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\'t do. Something Ronald Reagan was brilliant at, something that \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Obama does not appear capable of, the minute he sits down at \\r\\n\\t\\tthe desk and speaks to camera, but he manages to do it when he is in a \\r\\n\\t\\tspeaking situation. So he empathized and \\r\\n\\t\\timportantly he engaged in performative utterance. He ate seafood, \\r\\n\\t\\tthereby suggesting that it was safe to eat seafood and the next night \\r\\n\\t\\twhen he gave the speech, he was still alive, thereby suggesting that the \\r\\n\\t\\tevidence justified the claim that you could safely eat seafood. In other \\r\\n\\t\\twords, he got the build-up right. What does he do now \\r\\n\\t\\twith hisfirst Oval Office speech? He basically tells you he\\'s going to \\r\\n\\t\\thold BP accountable and the next day he holds BP accountable. He gets \\r\\n\\t\\this escrow account. As a result, he\\'s kept the promise. Difficulty is, that \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s a squandering of the first Oval Office speech which should have \\r\\n\\t\\tnot only held BP accountable, but harnessed the images in the Gulf that \\r\\n\\t\\twere in news for an extended period of time before that and he was slow \\r\\n\\t\\tto rhetorically respond. But nonetheless, harness those images to a \\r\\n\\t\\tcompelling case for climate change... -- climate change legislation; a \\r\\n\\t\\tcompelling case for climate change in my judgment is already being \\r\\n\\t\\tmade on its own. In that environment \\r\\n\\t\\tthe presidency offer, or the -- the context offered him as President the \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity to give a great speech. Presidents can\\'t just give a great \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech willy-nilly. They need to be in a context in which a great speech \\r\\n\\t\\tis invited. Now we have weeks of \\r\\n\\t\\tcoverage of every evocative image you can put in place from your own \\r\\n\\t\\tmemory and in that environment, the public is asking large questions \\r\\n\\t\\tthat could yield a legislative answer. Suppose that night he \\r\\n\\t\\tharnessed all of those images to a speech as graceful, as eloquent as \\r\\n\\t\\this epideictic during the campaign in service of that larger vision. And \\r\\n\\t\\the told us the cost and he told us the consequences if we did not act, \\r\\n\\t\\tand he said I may not be able to get this. I know that they\\'re going to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe -- there\\'s going to be Republicans on the other side who don\\'t want \\r\\n\\t\\tthis. I know I don\\'t have the sixty votes I need but it\\'s the most \\r\\n\\t\\timportant thing we can do in this environment. He might not have gotten \\r\\n\\t\\this legislation but he would have increased the likelihood he would have \\r\\n\\t\\tgotten it and that speech could have been memorable as a high point of \\r\\n\\t\\tthat presidency. He walked away from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe rhetorical moment and used his first Oval Office speech to basically \\r\\n\\t\\tsay I\\'m going to hold BP accountable which was practically a done deal \\r\\n\\t\\tanyway. They pretty much promised that they were going to be. So having \\r\\n\\t\\tset something up he didn\\'t capture the moment and that\\'s a failure of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis presidency. He also has not yet \\r\\n\\t\\tin this presidency in the moments in which he has given us major pieces \\r\\n\\t\\tof rhetoric offered us a digestive sense of what this presidency is \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to do. When one talks about these -- these setting docking \\r\\n\\t\\tstatements or digestive statements of the presidency such as, \"Ask not \\r\\n\\t\\twhat your country can do for you\". They sound as if they\\'re sound bites \\r\\n\\t\\tuntil you realize that there\\'s a definition underlying a presidency in \\r\\n\\t\\tthose kinds of statements. That helps us \\r\\n\\t\\tunderstand the Kennedy presidency. So when he confronts big steel, he \\r\\n\\t\\tcomes back to an ask not sacrifice theme. When hefounds the Peace \\r\\n\\t\\tCorps, he comes back to an ask not sacrifice theme. It\\'s a theme of \\r\\n\\t\\ttransformation of generational identity. There\\'s nothing that\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tcomparable in the -- the Obama lexicon, indeed I would challenge you to \\r\\n\\t\\tgive me a phrase that is memorable at all, that defines who we are and \\r\\n\\t\\twhere we\\'re going under this presidency. So he creates the \\r\\n\\t\\tcontext for speeches, he then doesn\\'t give in a satisfying fashion. He \\r\\n\\t\\tfocuses the media on the importance of the moment and he does that well \\r\\n\\t\\tand then the speeches don\\'t actually deliver. That\\'s failure number one. Failure number two, \\r\\n\\t\\tin those moments in which great rhetoric is called for, he doesn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tactually deliver the speech that responds to the moment. I\\'ve given you \\r\\n\\t\\tthe first, he didn\\'t take the Gulf catastrophe into a great rhetorical \\r\\n\\t\\tmoment, asking for some great, important initiative. Something that \\r\\n\\t\\twould change the climate as, you know, for future generations and change \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world as we know it. More importantly, \\r\\n\\t\\tsince we just heard the speech the other night, he did, he had the same \\r\\n\\t\\tproblem again. What is the concern of the American people as they sit \\r\\n\\t\\tdown to listen to the second speech? It actually isn\\'t the transition \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s happening in Iraq and it isn\\'t the transition in Afghanistan. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s the economy. American people come \\r\\n\\t\\tto that speech in many fewer numbers and they are asking among other \\r\\n\\t\\tthings what are you going to do now about an economy that\\'s faltering, \\r\\n\\t\\tan economy that may be going into a double-dip recession. To illustrate the \\r\\n\\t\\tfailure of rhetoric, I\\'m going to read the first sentence fromthe \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech. \"Good evening. Tonight I\\'d like to talk to you about the end of \\r\\n\\t\\tour combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe need to rebuild our nation at home.\" You cannot give a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat focus to speech that addresses the economic anxiety of the nation \\r\\n\\t\\tor tells us what we were doing in Iraq or celebrates the troop there or \\r\\n\\t\\ttalks about the transition in Afghanistan in any coherent, meaningful \\r\\n\\t\\tway out of that opening sentence. \"I\\'d like to talk to \\r\\n\\t\\tyou about the end of our combat mission?\" He doesn\\'t want to talk to us \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the end of our combat mission. What he wants to do in the speech \\r\\n\\t\\ttopically -- and he spends most of his time on it -- is pay tribute to the \\r\\n\\t\\ttroops. He doesn\\'t want to tell us the meaning of our being in Iraq. He \\r\\n\\t\\tcan\\'t. We haven\\'t satisfied our objectives there. It\\'s the end of the \\r\\n\\t\\tcombat mission. It\\'s not after all the end of the war and as he admits \\r\\n\\t\\the doesn\\'t have a government in place there. That country doesn\\'t have a \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment in place there so he can\\'t say we brought stable democracy. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd he certainly doesn\\'t want to spend much time with what we\\'ve got \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause what we\\'ve got is a corrupt government there. And I shouldn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tsay we, what they\\'ve got. He then says, \"The \\r\\n\\t\\tongoing security challenges we face.\" You can\\'t get a decent speech that \\r\\n\\t\\the\\'s going to give out of that as a preview. He\\'s not actually going to \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk about that anyway. It\\'s not the subject of the speech. And then the third \\r\\n\\t\\tpart of the sentence, \"And the need to rebuild our nation here at home.\" \\r\\n\\t\\tWe are not in any need to rebuild our nation. Our nation is just fine. \\r\\n\\t\\tIndeed a President is supposed to reassure us that our nation is fine, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we are resilient, that our democratic values are what make us \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat. He wants to say we \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to rebuild our economy at home. They haven\\'t even gotten the first \\r\\n\\t\\tsentence right and they\\'re not even in the speech yet. Now let\\'s look to \\r\\n\\t\\twhat he says about the economy once he gets to it. First he says too \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle. If that\\'s your central concern as the audience then the speech \\r\\n\\t\\tneeds to reduce your anxiety, explain what we\\'re going to do, and you \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to walk away from the speech believing things are going to get \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter. And it would help if you also believed that the stimulus is \\r\\n\\t\\tworking, because it can\\'t work if you don\\'t believe it is working and he \\r\\n\\t\\thas yet to persuade the American people that it actually is working. I\\'m going to go to a \\r\\n\\t\\tsentence that is an indictment of his own presidency in what should be \\r\\n\\t\\this central message. Again, \"Unfortunately,\" he says, \"Over the last \\r\\n\\t\\tdecade we have not done what is necessary to shore up the foundation of \\r\\n\\t\\tour own prosperity.\" Let me read this \\r\\n\\t\\tagain. \"Unfortunately over the last decade we have not done what is \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessary to shore up the foundation of our own prosperity.\" Let me ask \\r\\n\\t\\tyou this question. Over the last decade who has been President for a \\r\\n\\t\\tyear and a half? \"Over the last decade, we\" (I in the last year and a \\r\\n\\t\\thalf) \"have not done what is necessary to shore up the foundation of our \\r\\n\\t\\town prosperity.\" I don\\'t know what the \\r\\n\\t\\tspeech writers were thinking. I think they think the last decade was \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorge Bush\\'s presidency. Okay, well let\\'s assume that. Well then we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tindicting in a democratic President\\'s voice the last two years of the \\r\\n\\t\\tClinton presidency. This is poor writing, poorly executed, in a part of \\r\\n\\t\\ta speech that doesn\\'t do what it needed to do in order to satisfy the \\r\\n\\t\\tanxieties of an audience, who after all creates the meaning of discourse \\r\\n\\t\\tby bringing its assumptions to bear on what the audience is being \\r\\n\\t\\toffered by the speaker at a specific moment in time. Having said that \\r\\n\\t\\tlargely the Obama presidency succeeds in setting up speeches it never \\r\\n\\t\\tdelivers and when it delivers doesn\\'t deliver well, let me say one thing \\r\\n\\t\\tthat is positive about the rhetoric of the Obama presidency. There has \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen one high point rhetorically in this presidency and it was not a \\r\\n\\t\\ttraditional rhetorical moment. It was one that a \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident created. Presidents either respond to what\\'s there -- and he \\r\\n\\t\\tshould have in a way that he didn\\'t in the Gulf crisis -- or they create a \\r\\n\\t\\tmoment for us, wrestle our attention and tell us something we need to \\r\\n\\t\\tknow. When Barack Obama gathered the Republicans together andengaged in \\r\\n\\t\\ta dialoguewith them about the health care reform initiative, he \\r\\n\\t\\tdemonstrated the strength of his own arguments. He demonstrated his \\r\\n\\t\\tintellect. He demonstrated rhetorical capacity largely not evident in \\r\\n\\t\\tdebates. He suggests a high level of competence and also command of that \\r\\n\\t\\tas an issue and he won the moment. That person has \\r\\n\\t\\tgot to find his way to feature those skills in the presidency, if he is \\r\\n\\t\\tto become not a great President, if he is to become an adequate \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident rhetorically.',\n",
       " 'Thank you. I\\'m honored to be with you \\r\\ntoday for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. \\r\\nTruth be told, I \\r\\nnever graduated from college, and this is the closest I\\'ve ever \\r\\ngotten to a college graduation. Today, I want to tell you three stories from my \\r\\nlife. That\\'s it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about \\r\\nconnecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed \\r\\nCollege after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for \\r\\nanother 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was \\r\\nborn. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she \\r\\ndecided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be \\r\\nadopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at \\r\\nbirth by a lawyer and his wife -- except that when I popped out they decided at \\r\\nthe last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a \\r\\nwaiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, \"We\\'ve got an \\r\\nunexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said, \"Of course.\" My biological \\r\\nmother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that \\r\\nmy father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final \\r\\nadoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised \\r\\nthat I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go \\r\\nto college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as \\r\\nStanford, and all of my working-class parents\\' savings were being spent on my \\r\\ncollege tuition. After six months, I couldn\\'t see the value in it. I had no idea \\r\\nwhat I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me \\r\\nfigure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved \\r\\ntheir entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out \\r\\nokay. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best \\r\\ndecisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required \\r\\nclasses that didn\\'t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked \\r\\nfar more interesting. It wasn\\'t all romantic. I \\r\\ndidn\\'t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends\\' rooms. I returned \\r\\ncoke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the \\r\\nseven miles \\r\\nacross town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna \\r\\ntemple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity \\r\\nand intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time \\r\\noffered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the \\r\\ncampus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand \\r\\ncalligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn\\'t have to take the normal \\r\\nclasses, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I \\r\\nlearned aboutserifandsans-seriftypefaces, about varying the amount of space \\r\\nbetween different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. \\r\\nIt was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\\'t \\r\\ncapture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope \\r\\nof any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were \\r\\ndesigning the firstMacintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed \\r\\nit all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I \\r\\nhad never dropped in on that single course in college, the \"Mac\" would have never \\r\\nhad multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just \\r\\ncopied the Mac, it\\'s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had \\r\\nnever dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and \\r\\npersonal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of \\r\\ncourse it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in \\r\\ncollege. But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later. Again, you can\\'t connect the \\r\\ndots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have \\r\\nto trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in \\r\\nsomething -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever -- because believing that \\r\\nthe dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your \\r\\nheart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the \\r\\ndifference. My second story is about \\r\\nlove and loss. Iwas lucky \\r\\n-- I found what I \\r\\nloved to do early in life. Woz¹and I startedApplein my parents\\' garage when I \\r\\nwas 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us \\r\\nin a garage into a two billion dollar company with over 4000 employees. We\\'d just \\r\\nreleased our finest creation -- the Macintosh -- a year earlier, and I had just \\r\\nturned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you \\r\\nstarted? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to \\r\\nrun the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then \\r\\nour visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. \\r\\nWhen we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30, I was out. And very \\r\\npublicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it \\r\\nwas devastating. I really didn\\'t know what to \\r\\ndo for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of \\r\\nentrepreneurs down -- that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. \\r\\nI met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so \\r\\nbadly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away fromthe valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. \\r\\nThe turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, \\r\\nbut I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn\\'t see it then, but it \\r\\nturned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever \\r\\nhappened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness \\r\\nof being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one \\r\\nof the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, \\r\\nI started a company namedNeXT, another company namedPixar, and fell in love \\r\\nwith an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the \\r\\nworld\\'s first computer-animated feature film,Toy Story, and is now the most \\r\\nsuccessful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple \\r\\nbought NeXT, and I retuned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at \\r\\nthe heart of Apple\\'s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful \\r\\nfamily together. I\\'m pretty sure none of this \\r\\nwould have happened if I hadn\\'t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting \\r\\nmedicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometime life -- Sometimes life\\'s \\r\\ngoing to hit you in the head \\r\\nwith a brick. Don\\'t lose faith. I\\'m convinced that the only thing that kept me \\r\\ngoing was that I loved what I did. You\\'ve got to find what you love. And that is \\r\\nas true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a \\r\\nlarge part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what \\r\\nyou believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you \\r\\ndo. If you haven\\'t found it yet, keep looking -- and don\\'t settle. As with all matters \\r\\nof the heart, you\\'ll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it \\r\\njust gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking -- don\\'t \\r\\nsettle. My third story is about \\r\\ndeath. When I was 17, I read a \\r\\nquote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, \\r\\nsomeday you\\'ll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since \\r\\nthen, for the past 33 years, I\\'ve looked in the mirror every morning and asked \\r\\nmyself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am \\r\\nabout to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a \\r\\nrow, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I\\'ll be \\r\\ndead soon is the most important tool I\\'ve ever encountered to help me make the \\r\\nbig choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all \\r\\npride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the \\r\\nface of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are \\r\\ngoing to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have \\r\\nsomething to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your \\r\\nheart. About a year ago I was \\r\\ndiagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly \\r\\nshowed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn\\'t even know what a pancreas was. The \\r\\ndoctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, \\r\\nand that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor \\r\\nadvised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor\\'s code for \\r\\n\"prepare to die.\" It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you\\'d \\r\\nhave the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure \\r\\neverything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your \\r\\nfamily. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis \\r\\nall day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down \\r\\nmy throat, through my stomach into my intestines, put a needle into my \\r\\npancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was \\r\\nthere, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors \\r\\nstarted crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer \\r\\nthat is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and, thankfully, I\\'m fine now. This was the closest I\\'ve \\r\\nbeen to facing death, and I hope it\\'s the closest I get for a few more decades. \\r\\nHaving lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty \\r\\nthan when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even \\r\\npeople who want to go to heaven don\\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is \\r\\nthe destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it \\r\\nshould be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It\\'s \\r\\nLife\\'s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now \\r\\nthe new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the \\r\\nold and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it\\'s quite true. Your time is limited, so \\r\\ndon\\'t waste it living someone else\\'s life. Don\\'t be trapped by dogma -- which is \\r\\nliving with the results of other people\\'s thinking. Don\\'t let the noise of \\r\\nothers\\' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the \\r\\ncourage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you \\r\\ntruly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was \\r\\nan amazing publication calledThe Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the \\r\\n\"bibles\" of my generation. It was created by a fellow namedStewart Brandnot far \\r\\nfrom here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This \\r\\nwas in the late 60s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it \\r\\nwas all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of \\r\\nlike Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was \\r\\nidealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out \\r\\nseveral issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, \\r\\nthey put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the \\r\\nback cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country \\r\\nroad, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so \\r\\nadventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was \\r\\ntheir farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I\\'ve \\r\\nalways wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish \\r\\nthat for you: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " 'Alright, this is a -- this is a moment that I\\'ve dreamed about since...I\\'ve been a kid, running around the backyard pretending I wasDoug Flutie,throwing \"hail marys\" to my dad. Now I\\'m so blessed to be on the stage with such a group of great guys and to be -- to be invited into this fraternity. What a pleasure it really is. I\\'d like to start by thanking the Heisman Trust and everybody who made this weekend possible. What a great experience it was to -- to meet the people I have,MantiandCollin,not only great football players but great guys off the field as well. It\\'s been a pleasure to get to know you guys better and I wish you all the best of luck. It\\'s such an honor to represent Texas A&M and -- and my teammates here tonight. I wish they could be on this stage with me. Texas A&M -- choosing that school was one of the best decisions I\\'ve ever made in my entire life, and I\\'m so proud to be a part of that. To Mom, Dad, Mary, and the entire family watching: You mean the world to me and I just want to thank you for the encouragement, the love, and the patience over the years. Grandpa: All the times we used to play in the hallway and throw the ball till we couldn\\'t anymore -- I love you with all my heart, and you\\'ve inspired me to play football. And to Grandma, I\\'m so sorry for all the things that we broke in the house. To my coaches back atKerrville Tivy-- Mark Smith, Julius Scott and everybody there: You taught us all what it meant to really fight and work for something that you wanted more than anything in the world. You taught us about passion and about heart and what it truly meant to say, \"Tivy fight never dies.\" To Coach Sherman, Coach Rossley, Coach Sumlin, Coach Kingsbury, and everybody that\\'s been a part of my coaching -- a part of me playing football for my entire life: You\\'ve been -- You\\'ve been truly a blessing. You\\'ve taught -- taught me not only what it is to be a football player but to be a man as well. For that, I thank you so much. I wish my whole team could be up with me here tonight, especially my -- my great offensive line and -- and the whole offense: Luke Joeckel, Jarvis Harrison, Cedric Ogbuehi, Shane Matthews, and Patrick Lewis. I\\'m as safe standing right here as I am in the pocket with you guys. You\\'ve done a great job of keeping them off my back and I can\\'t thank you enough for everything. To all my teammates back home, I love you with all my heart. I\\'d especially at this time like to honor somebody who is near and dear to everybody at Texas A&M inJoey Villavisencio. Around this time last year, a center on our team passed away in a tragic car accident.\\xa0It was something that -- that as a whole team that we really had to fight through and press on through the bowl game. And to Mr. and Mrs. Villavisencio: If I had a son I would want him to be exactly like him. Well, I know Joey\\'s in a better place. And most of all I want to thank God for allowing me to be here. All that he\\'s blessed me with in my entire life, I\\'m so thankful for. For the love and the grace that you\\'ve shown me, I\\'ll be forever grateful. And in the values that I\\'ve learned from my parents, and that have been carried over by Texas A&M: leadership, respect, and putting others first -- it\\'s what the \"12th man\" is all about. I believe one -- the 12th man is one of the greatest traditions in all of college football. 40,000 students standing not as fans but as members of our team. To the 12th Man, to Texas A&M, Kerrville, Texas, and Aggies everywhere: This Heisman Trophy is for you. Gig \\'em.',\n",
       " '**Before we begin, I -- I want to \\r\\n\\t\\tsay a few words aboutWarren Christopher. He was a friend, a mentor, and \\r\\n\\t\\ttruly a diplomat\\x92s diplomat. He served our country with such great \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinction in so many capacities over his long and very productive \\r\\n\\t\\tlife. There are a lot of days in this job when I ask myself, \\x93What would \\r\\n\\t\\tWarren do?\\x94 From the Balkans to the Middle East, to China and Vietnam, \\r\\n\\t\\the helped guide the United States through difficult challenges with \\r\\n\\t\\ttremendous grace and wisdom. My thoughts and prayers are with his family \\r\\n\\t\\tand with his many, many friends and colleagues throughout our country \\r\\n\\t\\tand around the world. Now, this has been a quick \\r\\n\\t\\tbut productive trip, and I want to give you a brief update and then \\r\\n\\t\\tanswer your questions. First, let\\x92s remember how we got here. As you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, Americans and people around the world watched with growing concern \\r\\n\\t\\tas Libyan civilians were gunned down by a government that has lost all \\r\\n\\t\\tlegitimacy. The people of Libya appealed for help. The Arab League and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Gulf Cooperation Council called for action. The international community \\r\\n\\t\\tcame together to speak with one voice and to deliver a clear and \\r\\n\\t\\tconsistent message: Colonel Gaddafi campaign of violence against his \\r\\n\\t\\town people must stop. The strong votes in the United Nations Security \\r\\n\\t\\tCouncil underscored this unity. And now the Gaddafi forces face \\r\\n\\t\\tunambiguous terms: a ceasefire must be implemented immediately \\x96 that \\r\\n\\t\\tmeans all attacks against civilians must stop; troops must stop \\r\\n\\t\\tadvancing on Benghazi and pull back from Adjabiya, Misrata, and Zawiya; \\r\\n\\t\\twater, electricity, and gas supplies must be turned on to all areas; \\r\\n\\t\\thumanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya. Yesterday, President Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid very clearly that if Gaddafi failed to comply with these terms, \\r\\n\\t\\tthere would be consequences. Since the President spoke, there has been \\r\\n\\t\\tsome talk from Tripoli of a ceasefire, but the reality on the ground \\r\\n\\t\\ttells a very different story. Colonel Gaddafi continues to defy the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. His attacks on civilians go on. Today, we have been monitoring \\r\\n\\t\\tthe troubling reports of fighting**around and within Benghazi itself. As \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Obama also said, we have every reason to fear that, left \\r\\n\\t\\tunchecked, Gaddafi will commit unspeakable atrocities. It is against that backdrop \\r\\n\\t\\tthat nations from across the region and the world met today here in \\r\\n\\t\\tParis to discuss the ways we can, working together, implementResolution \\r\\n\\t\\t1973. We all recognize that further delay will only put more civilians \\r\\n\\t\\tat risk. So let me be very clear about the position of the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates: We will support an international coalition as it takes all \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessary measures to enforce the terms of Resolution 1973. As you may know, French \\r\\n\\t\\tplanes are already in the skies above Benghazi. Now, America has unique \\r\\n\\t\\tcapabilities and we will bring them to bear to help our European and \\r\\n\\t\\tCanadian allies and Arab partners stop further violence against \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilians, including through the effective implementation of a no-fly \\r\\n\\t\\tzone. As President Obama said, the United States will not deploy ground \\r\\n\\t\\ttroops, but there should be no mistaking our commitment to this effort. Today, I was able to discuss \\r\\n\\t\\tnext steps with the full group and also conduct smaller focused \\r\\n\\t\\tconversations with many of my colleagues. I met first with President \\r\\n\\t\\tSarkozy and Prime Minister Cameron. Both France and the United Kingdom, \\r\\n\\t\\talong with other key partners, have stepped forward to play a leading \\r\\n\\t\\trole in enforcing 1973. We reviewed the latest reports from the ground \\r\\n\\t\\tand discussed how we can work together most effectively in the hours and \\r\\n\\t\\tdays ahead, and how we would work very cooperatively with our other \\r\\n\\t\\tpartners, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, \\r\\n\\t\\tLithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, as \\r\\n\\t\\twell as others that are not in that long list. I also had the opportunity \\r\\n\\t\\tto engage today with my Arab counterparts, including Foreign Minister \\r\\n\\t\\tZebari of Iraq representing the presidency of the Arab Summit, Secretary \\r\\n\\t\\tGeneral Amr Moussa of the Arab League, Prime Minister Hamid bin Jasim of \\r\\n\\t\\tQatar, Sheikh Abdallah bin Zayid of the UAE, Foreign Minister Fassi \\r\\n\\t\\tFihri of Morocco, and Foreign Minister Judeh of Jordan. We have said from the start \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Arab leadership and participation in this effort is crucial, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Arab League showed that with its pivotal statements on Libya what \\r\\n\\t\\treally that meant. It changed the diplomatic landscape. They have sent \\r\\n\\t\\tanother strong message by being here today, and we look to them for \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinued leadership as well as active participation and partnership \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing forward. With Sheikh Abdallah and \\r\\n\\t\\tPrime Minister Hamid bin Jasim, I reiterated our strong and enduring \\r\\n\\t\\tpartnership. The United States has an abiding commitment to Gulf \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity and a top priority is working together with our partners on our \\r\\n\\t\\tshared concerns about Iranian behavior in the region. We share the view \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Iran\\x92s activities in the Gulf, including its efforts to advance its \\r\\n\\t\\tagenda in neighboring countries, undermines peace and stability. Our \\r\\n\\t\\tGulf partners are critical to the international community\\x92s efforts on \\r\\n\\t\\tLibya, and we thank them for their leadership. We also had a constructive \\r\\n\\t\\tdiscussion on Bahrain. We have a decades-long friendship with Bahrain \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we expect to continue long into the future. Our goal is a credible \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople of Bahrain, starting with the Crown Prince\\x92s dialogue, which all \\r\\n\\t\\tparties should join. Of course, that process \\r\\n\\t\\tshould unfold in a peaceful, positive atmosphere that protects the \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom of peaceful assembly while ensuring that students can go to \\r\\n\\t\\tschool, businesses can operate, and people can undertake their normal \\r\\n\\t\\tdaily activities. My GCC counterparts said \\r\\n\\t\\tthey share the same goals in Bahrain. Now, Bahrain obviously has the \\r\\n\\t\\tsovereign right to invite GCC forces into its territory under its \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense and security agreements. The GCC has also announced a major aid \\r\\n\\t\\tpackage for economic and social development in Bahrain. We have made \\r\\n\\t\\tclear that security alone cannot resolve the challenges facing Bahrain. \\r\\n\\t\\tAs I said earlier this week, violence is not and cannot be the answer. A \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical process is. We have raised our concerns about the current \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so. With all of these partners, \\r\\n\\t\\twe have discussed the urgent humanitarian needs arising from the crisis \\r\\n\\t\\tin Libya. I thanked the Arab leaders for their generous contributions to \\r\\n\\t\\taid refugees fleeing Gaddafi\\x92s violence, and we agreed that this will be \\r\\n\\t\\ta critical concern in the days ahead. Egypt and Tunisia, in particular, \\r\\n\\t\\twill need all of our support. The United States has made significant \\r\\n\\t\\tpledges of assistance, and we look to all our allies and partners to \\r\\n\\t\\tjoin us in this work. Now, this is a fluid and \\r\\n\\t\\tfast-moving situation, which may be the understatement of the time. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI know that there are lots of questions that people have about what next \\r\\n\\t\\tand what will we be doing. So let me just underscore the key point: This \\r\\n\\t\\tis a broad international effort; the world will not sit idly by while \\r\\n\\t\\tmore innocent civilians are killed. The United States will support our \\r\\n\\t\\tallies and partners as they move to enforce Resolution 1973. We are \\r\\n\\t\\tstanding with the people of Libya and we will not waver in our efforts \\r\\n\\t\\tto protect them. Thank you.   Question:Madam Secretary, will \\r\\n\\t\\tthe U.S. military actively be engaged in actually [inaudible] sorties \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible]? Twice you said the U.S. will support our allies. And I\\x92m \\r\\n\\t\\tjust wondering how active will the military involvement be. Secretary Clinton:Well, I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink that I\\x92ll stand by what I said. We will support the enforcement of \\r\\n\\t\\t1973. We have unique capabilities to bring to the international efforts, \\r\\n\\t\\tand we intend to do so. Question:Madam Secretary, you \\r\\n\\t\\tmentioned twice here again that it\\x92s important or crucial for Arab \\r\\n\\t\\tleadership and participation. Do you know exactly what that leadership \\r\\n\\t\\tand participation is now specifically and which countries are going to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe doing it? Secretary Clinton:Well, Matt, \\r\\n\\t\\tI think the fact that we had the representation around the table that we \\r\\n\\t\\tdid today and the very strong statements that were made by Arab \\r\\n\\t\\trepresentatives is extraordinarily important. But I will leave it to \\r\\n\\t\\tthem to announce their contributions. I think that\\x92s the appropriate way \\r\\n\\t\\tfor any further information to be made available. Question:I\\x92m sorry. But you do \\r\\n\\t\\texpect something more than them just being at the table today; they have \\r\\n\\t\\tpromised -- Secretary Clinton:Yes, we do \\r\\n\\t\\texpect more. Question:Madam Secretary, you \\r\\n\\t\\thave \\x96 actually, the reports now coming in from Benghazi are that it is \\r\\n\\t\\tquiet and it appears that the [inaudible] have stopped. I know \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible] so I didn\\x92t ask you earlier, but in general, President Sarkozy said that the doors of diplomacy will open when the aggression \\r\\n\\t\\tstops. Now, can you explain [inaudible] what that means? Is that the \\r\\n\\t\\tview of the entire coalition? Could it actually engage with Muamar \\r\\n\\t\\tQadhafi after [inaudible]? Secretary Clinton:Well, Jill, \\r\\n\\t\\tI will let President Sarkozy explain his own statement, but our \\r\\n\\t\\tassessment is that the aggressive actions by Qadhafi forces continue in \\r\\n\\t\\tmany places in the country. We saw it over the last 24 hours and we have \\r\\n\\t\\tseen no real effort on the part of the Qadhafi forces to abide by a \\r\\n\\t\\tceasefire, despite the rhetoric. Several of the speakers around the table said forcefully that they\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\theard these words, they\\x92ve heard them publicly, they were conveyed \\r\\n\\t\\tprivately, and they are not true. So I think our assessment is that it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\ttime for the international community to take action to back up \\r\\n\\t\\tResolution 1973. Question:In terms of the goal \\r\\n\\t\\tof this operation, is it to protect civilians or is it to remove Colonel \\r\\n\\t\\tQadhafi from power? Secretary Clinton:It is to \\r\\n\\t\\tprotect civilians and it is to provide access for humanitarian \\r\\n\\t\\tassistance. If you read the very comprehensive resolution that the \\r\\n\\t\\tSecurity Council passed, it is focused on protecting civilians from \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir own government. Yes. Question:Do you have any \\r\\n\\t\\tindication \\x96 I know you said [inaudible] Bahrain or UAE [inaudible] \\r\\n\\t\\tfighter jets were [inaudible] at all? Secretary Clinton:Again, I\\x92m \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to let individual countries make their own announcements. Question:Madam Secretary, the \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident\\x92s comments yesterday seemed to stop short of repeating his and \\r\\n\\t\\tyour calls for Qadhafi to step down. I\\x92m wondering if [inaudible] go \\r\\n\\t\\tback to that question, is there any way that the U.S. could see Libya\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tsituation resolving itself with Qadhafi somehow still in play? And what \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes this action with the UN resolution mean for Qadhafi\\x92s survival in \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible]? Secretary Clinton:Those are \\r\\n\\t\\tall questions that standing here are difficult to answer. And certainly \\r\\n\\t\\tthe conditions that will unfold as we begin to enforce this resolution \\r\\n\\t\\twill make a new environment in which people are going to act, including \\r\\n\\t\\tthose around Colonel Qadhafi. So I think we should take stock of where \\r\\n\\t\\twe are and how we got here, and how many times the international \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunity called on Qadhafi to end the violence against his own people \\r\\n\\t\\tand to take demonstrable steps to end the aggression and pull back; and \\r\\n\\t\\ttime and time again, starting with the first resolution, 1970, through \\r\\n\\t\\tthe succeeding time period, there was no evidence that he intended to do \\r\\n\\t\\tso, despite various claims that were made. And if the international community is to have credibility in this show \\r\\n\\t\\tof unit that 1973 represents, then action must take place. And if you \\r\\n\\t\\tlook at all the possible permutations of what could or could not happen \\r\\n\\t\\tonce the international community begins to enforce the resolution, there \\r\\n\\t\\tare many different outcomes and I\\x92m not going to speculate on what will \\r\\n\\t\\toccur. Question:Madam Secretary, I \\r\\n\\t\\tknow you said you didn\\x92t want to talk about what steps must come next, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut what did the group of leaders today agree to do? Secretary Clinton:They agreed \\r\\n\\t\\tto take all necessary measures, including military actions, to enforce \\r\\n\\t\\t1973. Question:But in terms of the \\r\\n\\t\\tdetails of that -- Secretary Clinton:Well, those \\r\\n\\t\\tare operational details, Steven. I think that it\\x92s understandable that \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92re not going to lay out every asset that\\x92s been pledged and every \\r\\n\\t\\taction that\\x92s been endorsed. But I think the coming together under \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Sarkozy\\x92s leadership today to reiterate that the words agreed \\r\\n\\t\\tto in the Security Council were more than just rhetorical commitments \\r\\n\\t\\tbut are being translated into very specific actions. Some countries are \\r\\n\\t\\tmore public with their specific pledges to what they are willing to do, \\r\\n\\t\\tand others are looking at how they can best contribute. But the \\r\\n\\t\\tconclusion of this meeting was for me very positive because it was an \\r\\n\\t\\tunmistakable commitment to enforcing the 1973 provisions. Yes. Question:What do today\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tactions do to [inaudible]? How would they [inaudible] that? Secretary Clinton:Well, I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink as I said, French planes were in the air as we were meeting, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthere will be other actions to follow. But there is no doubt that we\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to begin to enforce the resolution. Question:Madam Secretary, as \\r\\n\\t\\tyou yourself have said, for much of the 40 years Colonel Qadhafi has run \\r\\n\\t\\tthat country, it\\x92s been [inaudible] an international outlaw. What is the \\r\\n\\t\\tcompelling interest to the average American today to take this action? Secretary Clinton:I think \\r\\n\\t\\tthere are three very important interests. Number one, with all of the \\r\\n\\t\\tactivities that Colonel Qadhafi engaged in the past, we in the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates had a very clear interest in trying to contain him and prevent \\r\\n\\t\\thim from taking both direct and indirect actions against us and our \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople as well as many others. Following his decision to give up nuclear weapons in 2005, when it was \\r\\n\\t\\tfinally resolved, it appeared that there might be a new opportunity from \\r\\n\\t\\thim to join the international community. But unfortunately, that has not \\r\\n\\t\\tborne to be true and we now have the very brutal crackdown that he is \\r\\n\\t\\tconducting, which reminds us all why he was considered an outlaw in the \\r\\n\\t\\tpast. And it\\x92s unfortunate, but it is a reality that we have to take \\r\\n\\t\\tinto account. Secondly, this has been a time of great ferment in the region, and you \\r\\n\\t\\thave two countries bordering Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, that are \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitted to a democratic transformation. And they have long borders \\r\\n\\t\\twith Libya and they are facing humanitarian crises on those borders. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthere is a lot of concern about the people who are still inside Libya, \\r\\n\\t\\tboth Libyans and third-party nationals that no one can get to and that \\r\\n\\t\\tare basically unaccounted for, and a very unfortunate surmise that \\r\\n\\t\\tQadhafi does not approve of democracy and the actions being taken by his \\r\\n\\t\\tneighbors, which poses a lot of questions about what he might do in the \\r\\n\\t\\tfuture. But thirdly, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council statements \\r\\n\\t\\tcalling for actions by the United Nations were of historic importance. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere was a recognition by the Arab countries that Qadhafi had to be \\r\\n\\t\\tsuspended from the Arab League; but even beyond that, that a no-fly zone \\r\\n\\t\\tand related actions had to be taken. I think it would be quite unfortunate if the international community \\r\\n\\t\\twere to have ignored those requests, and it is in America\\x92s interests \\r\\n\\t\\talong with our European and Canadian allies to forge strategic \\r\\n\\t\\tpartnerships with Arab nations as we move forward into this new era of \\r\\n\\t\\tchange in the Arab world. So there are very specific reasons, there are regional concerns, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthen there are, in my view, very strong strategic rationales as to why \\r\\n\\t\\tthe United States will support. We did not lead this, we did not engage \\r\\n\\t\\tin unilateral actions in any way, but we strongly support the \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational community taking action against governments and leaders \\r\\n\\t\\twho behave as Qadhafi is unfortunately doing so now. And we think an \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational order that can bring about this kind of unity is very much \\r\\n\\t\\tin America\\x92s interest. Question:[inaudible] as \\r\\n\\t\\tconditions are unfolding that will create a new environment in which \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople will act [inaudible] Colonel Qadhafi, is that \\x96 do you believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthat [inaudible] in essence giving up on [inaudible] Colonel Qadhafi \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible] a lot of this [inaudible]. Secretary Clinton:I think \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92re aiming the messages at all of the decision makers inside Libya. As \\r\\n\\t\\tyou know, there have been quite a number of defections. The opposition \\r\\n\\t\\tis largely led by those who defected from the Qadhafi regime or who \\r\\n\\t\\tformerly served it. And it is certainly to be wished for that there will \\r\\n\\t\\tbe even more such defections, that people will put the future of Libya \\r\\n\\t\\tand the interests of the Libyan people above their service to Colonel \\r\\n\\t\\tQadhafi. Question:May I ask a non \\r\\n\\t\\tno-fly zone question, which is you met with Mr. Jabril here in Paris not \\r\\n\\t\\tthat long ago. Secretary Clinton:Right. Not \\r\\n\\t\\tthat long ago. Question:Are you any closer to \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking a decision on whether to follow the French lead in recognizing \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible] opposition? Secretary Clinton:We are not \\r\\n\\t\\tready to make a decision. We have increased our outreach and cooperation \\r\\n\\t\\twith members and leaders of the opposition. We are in almost hourly \\r\\n\\t\\tcontact with someone. But we think that the most important step for us \\r\\n\\t\\tto take now is to assist in every way that is unique to American \\r\\n\\t\\tcapabilities with the enforcement of 1973, which is, after all, the \\r\\n\\t\\tprincipal demand of the opposition. And that\\x92s what we\\x92re trying to \\r\\n\\t\\tmeet. Question:[Inaudible.] Secretary Clinton:What? Question:[Inaudible.] Secretary Clinton:With a lot \\r\\n\\t\\tof people. Question:[Inaudible.] Question:[Inaudible.] Secretary Clinton:No. Lot of \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. Yeah. Question:On the Hill, Senator \\r\\n\\t\\tLugar and others have repeatedly suggested that they thought the \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident should go to Congress to have a debate over whether a \\r\\n\\t\\tdeclaration of war [inaudible] involving the United States in actions in \\r\\n\\t\\tLibya. My question do you is do you think that those comments \\x96 do you \\r\\n\\t\\tthink that those are \\x96 there\\x92s merit to that? And would you describe \\r\\n\\t\\twhat\\x92s going on now as a war? Secretary Clinton:No. I think \\r\\n\\t\\tthe President made that clear in a meeting with congressional leaders \\r\\n\\t\\tthat he held in outlining all of the reasons why the United States was \\r\\n\\t\\tprepared to act in support of the international efforts on behalf of \\r\\n\\t\\t1973. And of course, we would always welcome congressional support, but \\r\\n\\t\\tthe President\\x92s very clear that the United States is acting in a way \\r\\n\\t\\tthat is within the existing authorities available to him.',\n",
       " \"Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya wasattacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They includedSean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and ourAmbassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.1 This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost. All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and generous nation. In the lobby ofthis building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn. Chris Stevensfell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own. In the early days of theLibyan Revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stopa tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations. Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department. He was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to Benghazi. The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself -- how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be. But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by asmall and savage group-- not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety. And last night, when I spoke with thePresident of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible. The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies, consulates, and citizens. There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with theprotestthat took place at our Embassy in Cairoyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is no justification for this. None. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially difficult that this happened onSeptember 11th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris, and their colleagues. May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity -- the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you, Dean Goldman, and good afternoon. Over the last two weeks, there\\x92s been a lot of commentary about what the Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act means for politicians in Washington. We\\x92ve heard speculation about winners and losers, about who\\x92s up and who\\x92s down, and about what this means for November.\\xa0And with Congressional Republicans staging their 31st repeal vote earlier today, it\\x92s clear that some want to keep the political battle going. So I\\x92m glad to be here with you today talk about what the health care law means for those outside Washington: the hard-working American families the law was designed to help.\\xa0And to do that, we need to remember where we were as a country when the law passed. Back in 2010, we faced urgent challenges relating to health care and our economy. Despite spending more on health care than any nation on earth, we had 50 million uninsured citizens and mediocre health results. And our health expenditures were consuming an increasing share of our GDP, threatening our global competitiveness. Families, businesses, and government were all struggling under the burden of rising costs. Between 2000 and 2009, premiums doubled.\\xa0The share of small businesses offering employee coverage dropped from nearly 70 percent to under 60 percent.\\xa0And Medicare costs continued to rise, putting the Trust Fund on pace to be insolvent in 2016. One small business owner in Florida summed up the frustration that so many Americans were feeling when he wrote to me: I am near the breaking point.\\xa0With guaranteed annual increases at 10 to 15 times inflation, eventually, we will go out of business or be forced to cancel insurance.\\xa0Either way, it\\x92s a lousy set of options. At the same time, the private health insurance market was becoming more consolidated and less competitive.\\xa0Some Americans had dependable access to coverage in public plans: children, seniors, the disabled, veterans, and the poorest adults and pregnant women.\\xa0Employees of large companies usually fared well. \\xa0But that left a lot of hard-working families in a broken market where insurance companies made all the rules. Insurers could cap your coverage, raise your rates, or even cancel your coverage with no accountability. And if you were one of the 129 million Americans with a pre-existing condition like cancer or even asthma, you had a good chance of being locked or priced out of the market altogether. This was a successful business model for insurance companies: The five largest insurers made 12 billion dollars in profit in 2009 alone.\\xa0But it didn\\x92t work so well for the rest of us. The health care law was passed to address the twin issues of cost and coverage, and that\\x92s exactly what has begun to happen over the last two years. The law\\x92s first principle is very simple: if you have coverage, you can keep it. So for the 250 million Americans with insurance today, the main change is that they\\x92ll get a little more security. The law puts in place new insurance rules prohibiting insurers from capping your coverage or cancelling it without cause when you get sick. Preventive care is now free for 54 million Americans with private plans.\\xa0And there are new limits on how much of your premium insurance companies can spend on overhead costs like CEO bonuses and ads.\\xa0As a result, 12.8 million Americans will get rebates from their insurance companies later this year.\\xa0That\\x92s right: Insurance companies will actually be sending money back to their customers. Despite what some have claimed, the Affordable Care Act does not cut Medicare benefits; in fact, it adds new benefits for seniors.\\xa0The law has begun to close the insurance gap in Medicare prescription drug plans -- the so-called \"donut hole\" -- saving 5.3 million Medicare beneficiaries with the highest medication costs an average of about 600 dollars each.\\xa0New efforts against fraud and abuse are already paying off, returning a record 5.4 billion dollars to the Trust Fund in the last two years. And yesterday, our department announced that more than 16.1 million people with Medicare have already gotten at least one free preventive service like a wellness visit or cancer screening in 2012 thanks to the law. Small business owners are getting some relief too thanks to a new tax credit that covers up to a third of their health insurance bill. And all Americans with insurance will benefit from no longer having to pay an extra 1,000 dollars per family to cover the uncompensated costs of Americans with no coverage. The law is also beginning to provide better coverage choices for middle class families.\\xa0Already, 3.1 million previously-uninsured young adults have been able to get coverage through their parents\\x92 plans.\\xa0And nearly 70,000 Americans, who had been totally shut out of the insurance market because of their pre-existing condition, are getting life-saving care thanks to new high risk plans. At the same time, the law has begun breaking the stalemate in Washington on addressing health care costs.\\xa0While everyone agrees that health costs are too high, there wasn\\x92t much action in Congress prior to the law passing. And the ideas put forward by those who favor repeal would limit government health spending simply by shifting costs to seniors and patients. The alternative vision put forward by the Affordable Care Act is to do on a national scale, what America\\x92s best health systems have done in their communities: that\\x92s bring down costs by improving care. Prior to the health reform law, many of the financial incentives in Medicare and Medicaid actually penalized care improvements. So over the last two years, we\\x92ve begun to change incentives in our health care system to reward providers for improving care.\\xa0And we\\x92ve had an enthusiastic response from doctors and hospitals.\\xa0For example on Monday, we announced that a total of 154 health organizations serving 2.4 million Americans have already signed up under the law to form Accountable Care Organizations, in which providers share in the savings when their patients stay healthy -- a huge first step. All this progress has happened in the last two years.\\xa0So when people talk about repealing this law, it\\x92s important to be clear about what\\x92s really at stake.\\xa0It\\x92s not the future political fortunes of elected politicians in Washington, all of whom already have excellent health care. It\\x92s the health and economic security of middle class families across America. Repeal would subject these families once again to the worst insurance abuses.\\xa0It would raise the price of seniors\\x92 medications and add financial barriers to their preventive care. It would end tax credits that are helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses cover their employees. It would force millions of young adults to once again begin their careers without the security of health coverage.\\xa0And it would mean the best quality care would continue to be out of reach for most Americans. Now is not the time to roll back this progress and start over.\\xa0It\\x92s time to build on this progress by moving forward to implement and improve the law. And that\\x92s exactly what our department is doing. As most of you know, two major parts of the coverage expansion in the law don\\x92t take effect in 2014.\\xa0First, new marketplaces will be set up in each state where families and small business owners can make an apples-to-apples comparison of health plans and choose the one that\\x92s right for them. Insurers will be forbidden from discriminating against anyone because of a pre-existing condition or charging more based on gender. Farm families, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and others who can\\x92t afford coverage will qualify for a tax credit, averaging about 4,000 dollars per family.\\xa0And Members of Congress and their families will have to get their coverage there too, alongside their constituents. Over the last two years, we\\x92ve partnered closely with states to start setting up these consumer-friendly marketplaces. Far from a \\x93federal takeover,\\x94 the law gives states maximum flexibility in shaping these marketplaces.\\xa0They can decide to fully operate their own state market, to partner with HHS to do it, or to have us do it. In fact, if states can come up with their own way of covering more people at the same quality and cost, the law allows them to do that too.\\xa0And the President has asked Congress to move up this provision so states can have this flexibility in year one. Yesterday, I received letters from 12 Governors saying that they plan to establish their own marketplaces.\\xa0And in the months to come, we\\x92ll keep working with states to get these marketplaces up and running by 2014. The second key change coming in 2014 is that states will begin receiving a very generous federal match to expand Medicaid coverage to uninsured adults making less than 15,000 dollars and families of four making less than 31,000 dollars. Here\\x92s what states are being offered. For the first three years, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs for additional coverage, as well as paying doctors who serve Medicaid patients at a higher rate. After 2017, the federal government will pay at least 90 percent of the costs -- a much more generous match than the average of 57 percent for Medicaid today.\\xa0States will also have flexibility in setting the benefits for the newly covered people.\\xa0And their expenditures will be offset by reduced spending on uncompensated care for the uninsured and other savings in the law. Unprecedented federal support, access to affordable coverage for low-income residents, and steep reductions in costs for the state, its citizens and its health providers: we think this is a deal that states -- in the end -- won\\x92t want to turn down. And we\\x92ve been through this before with the CHIP program. When Congress expanded coverage for kids in 1997 and offered to pay 70 percent of costs, states were initially skeptical.\\xa0Only eight states began covering eligible children in the first year.\\xa0But within two and a half years, all 50 states had decided the benefits far outweighed the costs and committed to participating. The 2014 Medicaid expansion offers states an even better deal, and we\\x92re hopeful states will take advantage of it to cover their neediest working families and ensure their hospitals and doctors get paid. Yesterday, I sent a letter to Governors laying out all this information. And we\\x92re going to keep working closely with states to make sure hard-working families have access to affordable coverage. Now that the Supreme Court has spoken, we need to stop refighting old political battles and trying to take away benefits that millions of Americans are relying on.\\xa0 Instead, we should move forward with implementing and improving this law to provide more security to Americans who have insurance, better choices for those who don\\x92t, and lower costs for all. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m Phil Knight. I\\'m chairman ofNike. Two months ago in Cupertino, California, they held amemorial service for Steve Jobs.Tim Cookwas asked to give one of the eulogies, and Tim Cook loved Steve Jobs. The week after the event, I called Tim Cook and I said, \"How in the world did you get through that?\" And he said, \"It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do and I have no idea.\" I\\'m about to find out. I have worked at Nike and its predecessor company for 48 years. Some might call me a short timer.1In those 48 years, I have never had a promotion. But it\\'s had its other benefits. It is how I metJoe Paterno. Thirty-three years ago, we started a college football coaches trip where coaches and their wives went with company people to -- to a resort for five days to get to know each other, to exchange ideas, and maybe just let down a little bit where there was no media and there was no donors. It was there that I met Joe. And a whole lot of Hall of Fame coaches have gone through those trips over those 33 years, includingBill Walsh,Bo Schembechler,Jimmy Johnson,Bobby Bowden,Mack Brown,Urban Meyer,Barry Switzer,Gene Stallings,Pete Carroll,Lavell Edwards, and hundreds of others. And the one coach they deferred to the most was Joe Paterno. A lot of serious talk goes on there, but in the letdown periods sometimes it gets a little goofy. One year we had a skit for Nebraska coachTom Osborneplayed Nikki Nike and Joe Paterno was a swaying palm tree. One of the great highlights those 15 years ago whenRick Neuheisel,who was the coach at Colorado at the time -- Rick played the guitar on Sunday evenings at the -- at the lounge at the Holiday Inn in Boulder. So, he was skilled, and he got on the stage and was playing his guitar and he asked Joe to come up and do a duet of \"Wild Thing.\" Joe didn\\'t hesitate. He jumped up on to the stage, and while not the most artistic performance ever, it was loud and enthusiastic. At it -- At its conclusion, the place exploded into a standing ovation and it became a tradition for every year. When Rick Neuheisel went to Baltimore, whyGary PattersonofTexas Christiancould also play the guitar, so \"Wild Thing\" became a tradition for all 15 of the last 15 years. Twenty-one days from now in Hawaii, there will be [an] enormous void on talent night. I\\'m a man who has always needed heroes. It started when I was a boy and I never outgrew it. It has, I\\'m sure, something to do with how I decided to make my living. A decade and a half ago anEsquiremagazine reporter, noting our advertising played up the heroic aspects of great athletes, asked the question, \"Who is your hero?\" My answer was simple: my college track coach and partner,Bill Bowerman. He had won four national championships, coached more sub-four-minute milers than anyone when he retired. He was the 1972 Olympic coach. And yet he insisted he was not a track coach -- that he was a \"professor of competitive response.\" One year at the University of Oregon, the only group that had a higher grade point average than the track team was the fraternity ofPhi Beta Kappa, and burned into every distance runner\\'s brain was his mantra: \"Do right and fear no man.\" When Bill Bowerman died on Christmas Eve in 1999, I asked myself what do I do for a hero now? Two months later on the Nike trip, the answer showed itself across the table wearing a thick set of eyeglasses. I said, \"I\\'m not asking your permission. I\\'m just telling you. I need someone to look up to. You\\'re my new hero.\" His response was typical. He threw that left hand up and said \"Ah, shaah.\" In the 12 years since, through four losing seasons, big bowl wins, 12-win seasons, through All-Americans, and players with criminal charges, with [4.0] students, and players dismissed from the team for discipline, never once did he let me down. Not one time. Conventional wisdom dictates that I would phrase it a different way. It would say in 11 of those 12 years he never let me down and those years outweighed this last year, but nobody ever accused me of wisdom of any kind, let alone conventional. In the year in question it turns out he gave full disclosure to his superiors, information that went up the chain to the head of the campus police and the president of the school. The matter was in the hands of aworld class universityand by apresident with an outstanding national reputation. Whatever the details of the investigation are, this much is clear to me: If there was a villain in this tragedy, it lies in that investigation, not in Joe Paterno\\'s response to it. And yet, for his actions he wasexcoriatedby the media and fired over the telephone by his university. Yet, in all his subsequent appearances, in the press, on TV, interacting with students, conversing with hospital personnel, givinginterviews to Sally Jenkins, he never complained, he never lashed out. Every word, every bit of body language conveyed a single message: We are Penn State. So I do not follow conventional wisdom. Joe is my hero -- every day for 12 of the last 12 years. But it does lead me to this question: Who is the real trustee at Penn State University? In periods of stress and grief, not only does your mind do funny things, you say things that surprise you. When I came back from mass on Sunday, Penny said, \"Heather called. Joe has passed.\" The first words out of my mouth, way out of sequence and typically self-centered, through the tears I asked, \"Who\\'s going to be my hero now?\" It\\'s a question everyone in this arena should ask and I do not have an answer for you, but I can tell you this much: That old hero, he set a standard that will live forever. Thank you.',\n",

And, of course, thanks to all of you for taking the time to be here \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday. Audience Member:We love you! First Lady Obama:Thanks so much. \\xa0That\\x92s very sweet of you. \\xa0I love you guys \\r\\n\\t\\ttoo. \\xa0I can\\x92t believe it\\x92s just a few weeks before Election Day, as we \\r\\n\\t\\tcome together to support the next President and Vice President of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine!\\xa0 And New Hampshire is \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to be important, as always. So I\\x92m going to get a little serious here, because I think we can all \\r\\n\\t\\tagree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because \\r\\n\\t\\tit has been a week of profound contrast. See, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day \\r\\n\\t\\tof the Girl and Let Girls Learn.\\xa0 And it was a wonderful \\r\\n\\t\\tcelebration. It was the last event that I\\x92m going to be doing as First \\r\\n\\t\\tLady for Let Girls Learn. \\xa0And I had the pleasure of spending hours \\r\\n\\t\\ttalking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet, \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung girls here in the U.S. and all around the world. \\xa0And we talked \\r\\n\\t\\tabout their hopes and their dreams. \\xa0We talked about their aspirations. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0See, because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just \\r\\n\\t\\tto attend school, jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, \\r\\n\\t\\trisking the rejection of their families and communities. So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how \\r\\n\\t\\tvaluable and precious they are. \\xa0I wanted them to understand that the \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.\\xa0 And I \\r\\n\\t\\ttold them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and \\r\\n\\t\\tI told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, and that they should make their voices heard in the world. \\xa0And I \\r\\n\\t\\twalked away feeling so inspired, just like I\\x92m inspired by all the young \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople here -- and I was so uplifted by these girls. \\xa0That \\r\\n\\t\\twas Tuesday. And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we \\r\\n\\t\\thave consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women -- \\r\\n\\t\\tlanguage that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but \\r\\n\\t\\tas parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, \\r\\n\\t\\trespectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation\\x92s leaders \\r\\n\\t\\tshould meet basic standards of human decency. The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for President of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so \\r\\n\\t\\tdemeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today. \\xa0And last \\r\\n\\t\\tweek, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting \\r\\n\\t\\twomen. \\xa0And I can\\x92t believe that I\\x92m saying that a candidate for \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting \\r\\n\\t\\twomen. And I have to tell you that I can\\x92t stop thinking about this. \\xa0It has \\r\\n\\t\\tshaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\\x92t have predicted. \\xa0So while \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn\\x92t happening, and to \\r\\n\\t\\tcome out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest \\r\\n\\t\\tand disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was \\r\\n\\t\\tall just a bad dream. This is not something that we can ignore. \\xa0It\\x92s not something we can \\r\\n\\t\\tjust sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad \\r\\n\\t\\telection season. \\xa0Because this was not just a \\x93lewd conversation.\\x94 \\xa0This \\r\\n\\t\\twasn\\x92t just locker-room banter. \\xa0This was a powerful individual speaking \\r\\n\\t\\tfreely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually \\r\\n\\t\\tbragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe TV. And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn\\x92t an \\r\\n\\t\\tisolated incident. \\xa0It\\x92s one of countless examples of how he has treated \\r\\n\\t\\twomen his whole life. \\xa0And I have to tell you that I listen to all of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis and I feel it so personally, and I\\x92m sure that many of you do too, \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly the women. \\xa0The shameful comments about our bodies. \\xa0The \\r\\n\\t\\tdisrespect of our ambitions and intellect. \\xa0The belief that you can do \\r\\n\\t\\tanything you want to a woman. It is cruel. \\xa0It\\x92s frightening. \\xa0And the truth is, it hurts. \\xa0It hurts. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0It\\x92s like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you\\x92re walking down \\r\\n\\t\\tthe street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words \\r\\n\\t\\tabout your body. \\xa0Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle too close, stares a little too long, and makes you feel \\r\\n\\t\\tuncomfortable in your own skin. It\\x92s that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt \\r\\n\\t\\twhen someone has grabbed them, or forced himself on them and they\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid no but he didn\\x92t listen -- something that we know happens on \\r\\n\\t\\tcollege campuses and countless other places every single day. \\xa0It \\r\\n\\t\\treminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about \\r\\n\\t\\thow, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped \\r\\n\\t\\tover every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough. We thought all of that was ancient history, didn\\x92t we? \\xa0And so many have \\r\\n\\t\\tworked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and \\r\\n\\t\\tdisrespect, but here we are, in 2016, and we\\x92re hearing these exact same \\r\\n\\t\\tthings every day on the campaign trail. \\xa0We are drowning in it. \\xa0And all \\r\\n\\t\\tof us are doing what women have always done: \\xa0We\\x92re trying to keep our \\r\\n\\t\\theads above water, just trying to get through it, trying to pretend like \\r\\n\\t\\tthis doesn\\x92t really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch it hurts makes us as women look weak. \\xa0Maybe we\\x92re afraid to be \\r\\n\\t\\tthat vulnerable. \\xa0Maybe we\\x92ve grown accustomed to swallowing these \\r\\n\\t\\temotions and staying quiet, because we\\x92ve seen that people often won\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\ttake our word over his. \\xa0Or maybe we don\\x92t want to believe that there \\r\\n\\t\\tare still people out there who think so little of us as women. \\xa0Too many \\r\\n\\t\\tare treating this as just another day\\x92s headline, as if our outrage is \\r\\n\\t\\toverblown or unwarranted, as if this is normal, just politics as usual. But, New Hampshire, be clear: \\xa0This is not normal. \\xa0This is not politics \\r\\n\\t\\tas usual.\\xa0 This is disgraceful. \\xa0It is intolerable. \\xa0And it doesn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter what party you belong to -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- \\r\\n\\t\\tno woman deserves to be treated this way. \\xa0None of us deserves this kind \\r\\n\\t\\tof abuse. And I know it\\x92s a campaign, but this isn\\x92t about politics. \\xa0It\\x92s about \\r\\n\\t\\tbasic human decency. \\xa0It\\x92s about right and wrong.\\xa0 And we simply \\r\\n\\t\\tcannot endure this, or expose our children to this any longer -- not for \\r\\n\\t\\tanother minute, and let alone for four years.\\xa0 Now is the time for \\r\\n\\t\\tall of us to stand up and say enough is enough.\\xa0 This has got to \\r\\n\\t\\tstop right now. Because consider this: \\xa0If all of this is painful to us as grown women, \\r\\n\\t\\twhat do you think this is doing to our children? \\xa0What message are our \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle girls hearing about who they should look like, how they should \\r\\n\\t\\tact? What lessons are they learning about their value as professionals, \\r\\n\\t\\tas human beings, about their dreams and aspirations? \\xa0And how is this \\r\\n\\t\\taffecting men and boys in this country? \\xa0Because I can tell you that the \\r\\n\\t\\tmen in my life do not talk about women like this. \\xa0And I know that my \\r\\n\\t\\tfamily is not unusual.\\xa0 And to dismiss this as everyday locker-room \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk is an insult to decent men everywhere. The men that you and I know don\\x92t treat women this way. \\xa0They are loving \\r\\n\\t\\tfathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed \\r\\n\\t\\tto this kind of vicious language about women. \\xa0They are husbands and \\r\\n\\t\\tbrothers and sons who don\\x92t tolerate women being treated and demeaned \\r\\n\\t\\tand disrespected.\\xa0 And like us, these men are worried about the \\r\\n\\t\\timpact this election is having on our boys who are looking for role \\r\\n\\t\\tmodels of what it means to be a man. In fact, someone recently told me a story about their six-year-old son \\r\\n\\t\\twho one day was watching the news -- they were watching the news \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether. \\xa0And the little boy, out of the blue, said, \\x93I think Hillary \\r\\n\\t\\tClinton will be President.\\x94 \\xa0And his mom said, \\x93Well, why do you say \\r\\n\\t\\tthat?\\x94 \\xa0And this little six-year-old said, \\x93Because the other guy called \\r\\n\\t\\tsomeone a piggy, and,\\x94 he said, \\x93you cannot be President if you call \\r\\n\\t\\tsomeone a piggy.\\x94 So even a six-year-old knows better. \\xa0A six-year-old knows that this is \\r\\n\\t\\tnot how adults behave. \\xa0This is not how decent human beings behave. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthis is certainly not how someone who wants to be President of the \\r\\n\\t\\tUnited States behaves. Because let\\x92s be very clear: \\xa0Strong men -- men who are truly role \\r\\n\\t\\tmodels -- don\\x92t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tPeople who are truly strong lift others up. \\xa0People who are truly \\r\\n\\t\\tpowerful bring others together. \\xa0And that is what we need in our next \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident. \\xa0We need someone who is a uniting force in this country. We \\r\\n\\t\\tneed someone who will heal the wounds that divide us, someone who truly \\r\\n\\t\\tcares about us and our children, someone with strength and compassion to \\r\\n\\t\\tlead this country forward. And let me tell you, I\\x92m here today because I believe with all of my \\r\\n\\t\\theart that Hillary Clinton will be that President. See, we know that Hillary is the right person for the job because we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tseen her character and commitment not just in this campaign, but over \\r\\n\\t\\tthe course of her entire life. \\xa0The fact is that Hillary embodies so \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of the values that we try so hard to teach our young people. \\xa0We \\r\\n\\t\\ttell our young people \\x93Work hard in school, get a good education.\\x94 \\xa0We \\r\\n\\t\\tencourage them to use that education to help others -- which is exactly \\r\\n\\t\\twhat Hillary did with her college and law degrees, advocating for kids \\r\\n\\t\\twith disabilities, fighting for children\\x92s health care as First Lady, \\r\\n\\t\\taffordable child care in the Senate. We teach our kids the value of being a team player, which is what \\r\\n\\t\\tHillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed \\r\\n\\t\\tto work for her opponent as our Secretary of State -- earning sky-high approval ratings serving her country once again. We also teach our kids that you don\\x92t take shortcuts in life, and you \\r\\n\\t\\tstrive for meaningful success in whatever job you do. \\xa0Well, Hillary has \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe United States, a U.S. senator, Secretary of State. \\xa0And she has been \\r\\n\\t\\tsuccessful in every role, gaining more experience and exposure to the \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidency than any candidate in our lifetime -- more than Barack, more \\r\\n\\t\\tthan Bill.\\xa0 And, yes, she happens to be a woman. And finally, we teach our kids that when you hit challenges in life, you \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t give up, you stick with it. \\xa0Well, during her four years as \\r\\n\\t\\tSecretary of State alone, Hillary has faced her share of challenges. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0She\\x92s traveled to 112 countries, negotiated a ceasefire, a peace \\r\\n\\t\\tagreement, a release of dissidents. \\xa0She spent 11 hours testifying \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore a congressional committee. \\xa0We know that when things get tough, \\r\\n\\t\\tHillary doesn\\x92t complain. \\xa0She doesn\\x92t blame others. \\xa0She doesn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tabandon ship for something easier. \\xa0No, Hillary Clinton has never quit \\r\\n\\t\\ton anything in her life. So in Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public \\r\\n\\t\\tservice, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tShe is an outstanding mother. \\xa0She has raised a phenomenal young woman. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0She is a loving, loyal wife. \\xa0She\\x92s a devoted daughter who cared for \\r\\n\\t\\ther mother until her final days. \\xa0And if any of us had raised a daughter \\r\\n\\t\\tlike Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. \\xa0We would be proud. And regardless of who her opponent might be, no one could be more \\r\\n\\t\\tqualified for this job than Hillary -- no one. \\xa0And in this election, if \\r\\n\\t\\twe turn away from her, if we just stand by and allow her opponent to be \\r\\n\\t\\telected, then what are we teaching our children about the values they \\r\\n\\t\\tshould hold, about the kind of life they should lead? \\xa0What are we \\r\\n\\t\\tsaying? In our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary\\x92s opponent win this \\r\\n\\t\\telection, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that \\r\\n\\t\\teverything they\\x92re seeing and hearing is perfectly okay. \\xa0We are \\r\\n\\t\\tvalidating it. \\xa0We are endorsing it. \\xa0We\\x92re telling our sons that it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tokay to humiliate women. We\\x92re telling our daughters that this is how \\r\\n\\t\\tthey deserve to be treated. We\\x92re telling all our kids that bigotry and \\r\\n\\t\\tbullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country. \\xa0Is \\r\\n\\t\\tthat what we want for our children? Audience Members:No! First Lady Obama:And remember, we \\r\\n\\t\\twon\\x92t just be setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. \\xa0Because for so long, America has been a model for countries \\r\\n\\t\\tacross the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting that \\r\\n\\t\\tthey give more rights to their women. \\xa0But if we have a President who \\r\\n\\t\\troutinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, \\r\\n\\t\\tthen how can we maintain our moral authority in the world? \\xa0How can we \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to be a beacon of freedom and justice and human dignity? Well, fortunately, New Hampshire, here\\x92s the beauty: \\xa0We have everything \\r\\n\\t\\twe need to stop this madness. \\xa0You see, while our mothers and \\r\\n\\t\\tgrandmothers were often powerless to change their circumstances, today, \\r\\n\\t\\twe as women have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this \\r\\n\\t\\telection. We have knowledge. \\xa0We have a voice. \\xa0We have a vote. \\xa0And on November \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 8th, we as women, we as Americans, we as decent human beings can \\r\\n\\t\\tcome together and declare that enough is enough, and we do not tolerate \\r\\n\\t\\tthis kind of behavior in this country. Remember this: \\xa0In 2012, women\\x92s votes were the difference between \\r\\n\\t\\tBarack winning and losing in key swing states, including right here in \\r\\n\\t\\tNew Hampshire.\\xa0 So for anyone who might be thinking that your one \\r\\n\\t\\tvote doesn\\x92t really matter, or that one person can\\x92t really make a \\r\\n\\t\\tdifference, consider this: \\xa0Back in 2012, Barack won New Hampshire by \\r\\n\\t\\tabout 40,000 votes, which sounds like a lot. \\xa0But when you break that \\r\\n\\t\\tnumber down, the difference between winning and losing this state was \\r\\n\\t\\tonly 66 votes per precinct. \\xa0Just take that in. \\xa0If 66 people each \\r\\n\\t\\tprecinct had gone the other way, Barack would have lost. So each of you right here today could help swing an entire precinct and \\r\\n\\t\\twin this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your families, \\r\\n\\t\\tand your friends and neighbors out to vote. \\xa0You can do it right here.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tBut you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary\\x92s opponent \\r\\n\\t\\twith a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration. Because here\\x92s the truth: \\xa0Either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will \\r\\n\\t\\tbe elected President this year. \\xa0And if you vote for someone other than \\r\\n\\t\\tHillary, or if you don\\x92t vote at all, then you are helping to elect her \\r\\n\\t\\topponent. \\xa0And just think about how you will feel if that happens. \\r\\n\\t\\tImagine waking up on November the 9th and looking into the eyes of your \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughter or son, or looking into your own eyes as you stare into the \\r\\n\\t\\tmirror. \\xa0Imagine how you\\x92ll feel if you stayed home, or if you didn\\x92t do \\r\\n\\t\\teverything possible to elect Hillary. We simply cannot let that happen. \\xa0We cannot allow ourselves to be so \\r\\n\\t\\tdisgusted that we just shut off the TV and walk away. \\xa0And we can\\x92t just \\r\\n\\t\\tsit around wringing our hands. \\xa0Now, we need to recover from our shock \\r\\n\\t\\tand depression and do what women have always done in this country. \\xa0We \\r\\n\\t\\tneed you to roll up your sleeves. \\xa0We need to get to work.\\xa0 Because \\r\\n\\t\\tremember this: \\xa0When they go low, we go -- Audience Members:High! First Lady Obama:Yes, we do. And voting ourselves is a great start, but we also have to step up and \\r\\n\\t\\tstart organizing. \\xa0So we need you to make calls, and knock on doors, and \\r\\n\\t\\tget folks to the polls on Election Day, and sign up to volunteer with \\r\\n\\t\\tone of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today just waiting for \\r\\n\\t\\tyou to step up. And, young people and not-so-young people, get on social media.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tShare your own story of why this election matters, why it should matter \\r\\n\\t\\tfor all people of conscience in this country. \\xa0There is so much at stake \\r\\n\\t\\tin this election. See, the choice you make November 8th could determine whether we have a \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident who treats people with respect -- or not. \\xa0A President who \\r\\n\\t\\twill fight for kids, for good schools, for good jobs for our families -- \\r\\n\\t\\tor not. \\xa0A President who thinks that women deserve the right to make our \\r\\n\\t\\town choices about our bodies and our health -- or not.\\xa0 That\\x92s just \\r\\n\\t\\ta little bit of what\\x92s at stake. So we cannot afford to be tired or turned off. \\xa0And we cannot afford to \\r\\n\\t\\tstay home on Election Day. \\xa0Because on November the 8th, we have the \\r\\n\\t\\tpower to show our children that America\\x92s greatness comes from \\r\\n\\t\\trecognizing the innate dignity and worth of all our people. \\xa0On November \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 8th, we can show our children that this country is big enough to \\r\\n\\t\\thave a place for us all -- men and women, folks of every background and \\r\\n\\t\\twalk of life -- and that each of us is a precious part of this great \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican story, and we are always stronger together. On November 8th, we can show our children that here in America, we \\r\\n\\t\\treject hatred and fear -- and in difficult times, we don\\x92t discard our \\r\\n\\t\\thighest ideals. \\xa0No, we rise up to meet them. \\xa0We rise up to perfect our \\r\\n\\t\\tunion. \\xa0We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty. \\xa0We rise up to \\r\\n\\t\\tembody the values of equality and opportunity and sacrifice that have \\r\\n\\t\\talways made this country the greatest nation on Earth. That is who we are.\\xa0 And don\\x92t ever let anyone tell you \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferently.\\xa0 Hope is important. \\xa0Hope is important for our young \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. \\xa0And we deserve a President who can see those truths in us -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident who can bring us together and bring out the very best in us. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0Hillary Clinton will be that President. So for the next 26 days, we need to do everything we can to help her and \\r\\n\\t\\tTim Kaine win this election. \\xa0I know I\\x92m going to be doing it. \\xa0Are you \\r\\n\\t\\twith me?\\xa0 Are you all with me?\\xa0 You ready to roll up your \\r\\n\\t\\tsleeves? \\xa0Get to work knocking on doors? All right, let\\x92s get to work. \\xa0Thank you all. \\xa0God bless.',\n",
       " 'Thank you, very much. Thank you. Thank you, \\r\\nvery much. My friends, fellow Democrats, fellow Americans: I\\x92m going to be candid with you. I had hoped to \\r\\nbe back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. \\r\\nBut you know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there\\x92s that \\r\\nlittle-known third category.  But I didn\\x92t come here tonight to talk about \\r\\nthe past. After all, I don\\x92t want you to think that I lie awake at night \\r\\ncounting and recounting sheep. I prefer to focus on the future, because I know \\r\\nfrom my own experience that America\\x92s a land of opportunity, where every little \\r\\nboy and girl has a chance to grow up and win the popular vote. In all seriousness, I am deeply, deeply \\r\\ngrateful for the opportunity you have given me to serve my country. I want to \\r\\nthank you as Democrats for the honor of being your nominee for President four \\r\\nyears ago and for all you did for me and for our country. And I want to thank \\r\\nthe American people for the privilege of serving as Vice President of the United \\r\\nStates. Most of all, I want to thank my family with all my heart -- my children \\r\\nand grandchildren, especially my beloved partner in life, Tipper. I love this country deeply. Wasn\\x92t BeBe Winans \\r\\ngreat? I believe that\\x92s the best national anthem I\\x92ve ever heard sung. I love \\r\\nthis country deeply, and even though I always look to the future with optimism \\r\\nand hope, I do think it\\x92s worth pausing for just a moment as we begin this \\r\\nyear\\x92s convention, to take note of two very important lessons from four years \\r\\nago. The first lesson is this: Take it from me; \\r\\nevery vote counts. In our democracy, every vote has power. And never forget that \\r\\npower is yours. Don\\x92t let anyone take it away from you or talk you into throwing \\r\\nit away. And let\\x92s make sure that this time every vote \\r\\nis counted. Let\\x92s make sure that the Supreme Court does not pick the next \\r\\nPresident, and that this President is not the one who picks the next Supreme \\r\\nCourt. The second lesson from 2000 is this: What \\r\\nhappens in a presidential election matters -- a lot. The outcome profoundly \\r\\naffects the lives of all 293 million Americans, and people in the rest of the \\r\\nworld, too. The choice of who is president affects your life and your family\\x92s \\r\\nfuture. And never has that been more true than in 2000 \\r\\nand 4, because let\\x92s face it our country faces deep challenges. These challenges \\r\\nwe now confront are not Democratic or Republican challenges; they are American \\r\\nchallenges that we all must overcome together as one people, as one nation. And it is in that spirit, that I sincerely ask \\r\\nthose watching at home tonight who supported President Bush four years ago: did \\r\\nyou really get what you expected from the candidate you voted for? Is our \\r\\ncountry more united today? Or more divided? Has the promise of compassionate \\r\\nconservatism been fulfilled? Or do those words now ring hollow? For that matter, are the economic policies \\r\\nreally conservative at all? For example, did you expect the largest deficits in \\r\\nhistory, year after year? One right after another? And the loss of more than a \\r\\nmillion jobs? By the way, I know about the bad economy. I was \\r\\nthe first one laid off. And while it\\x92s true that new jobs are being created, \\r\\nthey\\x92re just not as good as the jobs people have lost. And incidentally, that\\x92s \\r\\nbeen true for me too. Unfortunately, this is no joke for millions of Americans. \\r\\nAnd the real solutions require us to transcend partisanship. So that\\x92s one \\r\\nreason why, even though we meet here as Democrats, we believe this is a time to \\r\\nreach beyond our party lines to Republicans as well. And I also ask tonight for the consideration \\r\\nand the help of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000. I urge you \\r\\nto ask yourselves this question: Do you still believe that there was no \\r\\ndifference between the candidates? Are you troubled by the erosion of America\\x92s \\r\\nmost basic civil liberties? Are you worried that our environmental laws are \\r\\nbeing weakened and dismantled to allow vast increases in pollution that are \\r\\ncontributing to a global climate crisis? No matter how you voted in the last \\r\\nelection, these are profound problems that all voters must take into account \\r\\nthis November 2nd. And of course, no challenge is more critical \\r\\nthan the situation we confront in Iraq. Regardless of your opinion at the \\r\\nbeginning of this war, isn\\x92t it now abundantly obvious that the way this war has \\r\\nbeen managed by the administration has gotten us into very serious trouble? \\r\\nWouldn\\x92t we be better off with a new President who hasn\\x92t burned his bridges to \\r\\nour allies, and who can rebuild respect for America in the world? Isn\\x92t \\r\\ncooperation with other nations crucial to solving our dilemma in Iraq? Isn\\x92t it \\r\\nalso critical to defeating the terrorists? We have to be crystal clear about the threat we \\r\\nface from terrorism. It is deadly. It is real. It is imminent. But in order to \\r\\nprotect our people, shouldn\\x92t we focus on the real source of this threat: the \\r\\ngroup that attacked us and is trying to attack us again: Al Qaeda, headed by \\r\\nOsama bin Laden? Wouldn\\x92t we be safer with a President who didn\\x92t insist on \\r\\nconfusing Al Qaeda with Iraq? Doesn\\x92t that divert too much of our attention away \\r\\nfrom the principal danger? I want to say to all Americans this evening \\r\\nthat whether it\\x92s the threat to the global environment or the erosion of \\r\\nAmerica\\x92s leadership in the world, whether it is the challenge to our economy \\r\\nfrom new competitors or the challenge to our security from new enemies, I \\r\\nbelieve we need new leadership that is both strong and wise. And we can have new \\r\\nleadership, because one of our greatest strengths as a democracy is that when \\r\\nwe\\x92re headed in the wrong direction, we can correct our course. When policies \\r\\nare clearly not working, we, the people, can change them. If our leaders make \\r\\nmistakes, we can hold them accountable -- even if they never admit their \\r\\nmistakes. I firmly believe America needs new leadership \\r\\nthat will make us stronger at home and respected in the world.And we\\x92re here \\r\\nthis week to present to the nation the man who should be and will be our new \\r\\npresident: John Kerry. John and I were elected to the United States \\r\\nSenate on the same day 20 years ago, and I have worked closely with him for all \\r\\nthat time. So I want to say a personal word about John Kerry the man. He is a \\r\\nfriend who will stand by you. His word is his bond. He has a deep patriotism \\r\\nthat goes far beyond words. He has devoted his life to making America a better \\r\\nplace for all of us. He showed uncommon heroism on the battlefield \\r\\nin Vietnam. I watched him show that same courage on the Senate floor. For \\r\\nexample, he had the best record of protecting the environment against polluters \\r\\nof any of my colleagues bar none. He never shied away from a fight, no matter \\r\\nhow powerful the foe. He was never afraid to take on difficult and thankless \\r\\nissues that few others wanted to touch -- like exposing the threat of \\r\\nnarcoterrorism and tracing the sources of terrorist financing. He was one of the \\r\\nvery first in our Party to take on the issue of drastic deficit reduction. And \\r\\nhe\\x92s developed a tough and thoughtful plan to restore our economic strength and \\r\\nfiscal discipline. To put it simply, those of us who have worked \\r\\nwith John know that he has the courage, integrity and leadership to be a truly \\r\\ngreat President of the United States of America. And he showed wisdom in his very first decision \\r\\nas the leader of our Party when he picked as his running mate an inspiring \\r\\nfighter for middle class families and families struggling to reach the middle \\r\\nclass: John Edwards of North Carolina. John Kerry and John Edwards are fighting for us \\r\\nand for all Americans, so after we nominate them here in Boston and return back \\r\\nto our home states across this land, we have to fight for them. Talk to your \\r\\nfriends and neighbors, go to \"JohnKerry.com,\" \\r\\nraise money, register voters, get \\'em to the polls, volunteer your time, and \\r\\nabove all: make your vote count. To those of you who felt disappointed or angry \\r\\nwith the outcome in 2000, I want you to remember all of those feelings. But then \\r\\nI want you to do with them what I have done: focus them fully and completely on \\r\\nputting John Kerry and John Edwards in the White House in 2000 and 4, so we can \\r\\nhave a new direction in America, a new President, a new Vice President, new \\r\\npolicies, a new day, a brighter future -- what this country and what our people \\r\\ndeserve. Fellow Democrats, when I look out and see so \\r\\nmany friends who have meant so much to me in my own public service, my heart is \\r\\nfull tonight. I thank you for all the love you\\x92ve shown to Tipper and me. You \\r\\nwill forever be in our hearts. And there\\x92s someone else I\\x92d like to thank, and \\r\\nthat\\x92s the man who asked me to join him on the ticket at our convention 12 years \\r\\nago, my friend and my partner for eight years: President Bill Clinton. I will \\r\\nnever forget that convention or that campaign the way we barnstormed our \\r\\ncountry, carrying a message of hope and change, believing with our whole hearts \\r\\nthat America could be made new again. And so it was. And with your help, and \\r\\nwith the leadership of John Kerry and John Edwards, so it shall be again. Thank \\r\\nyou, God bless you, and may God bless the United States.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much. Rain, somebody said, is like confetti from heaven. So even the heavens \\r\\n\\t\\tare celebrating this morning, joining the rest of us at this wonderful \\r\\n\\t\\tcommencement ceremony. Before we go any further, graduates, you have an \\r\\n\\t\\timportant task to perform because behind you are your parents and \\r\\n\\t\\tguardians. Two or three or four years ago, they drove intoCardigan, \\r\\n\\t\\tdropped you off, helped you get settled and then turned around and drove \\r\\n\\t\\tback out the gates. It was an extraordinary sacrifice for them. They \\r\\n\\t\\tdrove down the trail of tears back to an emptier and lonelier house. They did that because the decision about your education, they knew, was \\r\\n\\t\\tabout you. It was not about them. That sacrifice and others they made \\r\\n\\t\\thave brought you to this point. But this morning is not just about you. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt is also about them. So I hope you will stand up and turn around and \\r\\n\\t\\tgive them a great round of applause, please. Now when somebody asks me how the remarks at \\r\\n\\t\\tCardigan went, I will be \\r\\n\\t\\table to say they were interrupted by applause. Congratulations, class of \\r\\n\\t\\t2017. You\\'ve reached an important milestone. An important stage of your \\r\\n\\t\\tlife is behind you. I\\'m sorry to be the one to tell you it is the \\r\\n\\t\\teasiest stage of your life, but it is in the books. Now While you\\'ve been at \\r\\n\\t\\tCardigan, you have all been a part of an important international \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunity as well. And I think that needs to be particularly recognized. Now around the country today at colleges, high schools, middle schools, \\r\\n\\t\\tcommencement speakers are standing before impatient graduates, and they \\r\\n\\t\\tare almost always saying the same things. They will say that \"today is a \\r\\n\\t\\tcommencement exercise.\" \"It is a beginning, not an end.\" \"You should look \\r\\n\\t\\tforward.\" And I think that is true enough. However, I think if you\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to look forward to figure out where you\\'re going, it\\'s good to \\r\\n\\t\\tknow where you\\'ve been, and to look back as well. And I think if you look \\r\\n\\t\\tback to your first afternoon here at Cardigan, perhaps you will recall \\r\\n\\t\\tthat you were lonely. Perhaps you will recall that you were a little \\r\\n\\t\\tscared, a little anxious. And now look at you. You are surrounded by \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends that you call brothers, and you are confident in facing the next \\r\\n\\t\\tstep in your education. It is worth trying to think why that is so. And when you do, I think you \\r\\n\\t\\tmay appreciate that it was because of the support of your classmates in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe classroom, on the athletic field, and in the dorms. And as far as the \\r\\n\\t\\tconfidence goes, I think you will appreciate that it is not because you \\r\\n\\t\\tsucceeded at everything you did, but because, with the help of your \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends, you were not afraid to fail. And if you did fail, you got up \\r\\n\\t\\tand tried again. And if you failed again, you got up and tried again. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd if you failed again, it might be time to think about doing something \\r\\n\\t\\telse. But it was not just success, but not being afraid to fail that \\r\\n\\t\\tbrought you to this point. Now the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and \\r\\n\\t\\textend good wishes to you. I will not do that and I\\'ll tell you why. From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated \\r\\n\\t\\tunfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope \\r\\n\\t\\tthat you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance \\r\\n\\t\\tof loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to \\r\\n\\t\\ttime so that you don\\'t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, \\r\\n\\t\\tagain, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of \\r\\n\\t\\tchance in life and understand that your success is not completely \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved \\r\\n\\t\\teither. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every \\r\\n\\t\\tnow and then your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way \\r\\n\\t\\tfor you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you\\'ll be \\r\\n\\t\\tignored so you know the importance of listening to others. And I hope \\r\\n\\t\\tyou will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these \\r\\n\\t\\tthings or not, they\\'re going to happen. And whether you -- you benefit from \\r\\n\\t\\tthem or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your \\r\\n\\t\\tmisfortunes. Now commencement speakers are also expected to give some advice. They \\r\\n\\t\\tgive grand advice, and they give some useful tips. The most common grand \\r\\n\\t\\tadvice they give is for you to be yourself. It is an odd piece of advice \\r\\n\\t\\tto give people dressed identically, but you should -- you should be \\r\\n\\t\\tyourself. But you should understand what that means. Unless you are \\r\\n\\t\\tperfect, it does not mean don\\'t make any changes. In a certain sense, \\r\\n\\t\\tyou should not be yourself. You should try to become something better. \\r\\n\\t\\tPeople say \"be yourself\" because they want you to resist the impulse to \\r\\n\\t\\tconform to what others want you to be. But you can\\'t be yourself if you \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t learn who are, and you can\\'t learn who you are unless you think \\r\\n\\t\\tabout it.2 The Greek philosopherSocrates said, \"The unexamined life is not worth \\r\\n\\t\\tliving.\" And while \"Just \\r\\n\\t\\tDo It\" might be a good motto for some things, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s not a good motto when it\\'s trying to figure out how to live your \\r\\n\\t\\tlife that is before you. And one important clue to living a good life is \\r\\n\\t\\tto not to try to livethegood life.3The best way to lose the \\r\\n\\t\\tvalues that are central to who you are is, frankly, not to think about \\r\\n\\t\\tthem at all. So that\\'s the deep advice. Now some tips as you get ready to go to your \\r\\n\\t\\tnew school. Over the last couple of years, I have gotten to know many \\r\\n\\t\\tof you young men pretty well, and I know you are good guys. But you are \\r\\n\\t\\talso privileged young men. And if you weren\\'t privileged when you came \\r\\n\\t\\there, you\\'re privileged now because you have been here. My advice is: \\r\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t act like it. When you get to your new school, walk up and introduce yourself to the \\r\\n\\t\\tperson who is raking the leaves, shoveling the snow, or emptying the \\r\\n\\t\\ttrash. Learn their name and call them by their name during your time at \\r\\n\\t\\tthe school. Another piece of advice: When you pass by people you don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\trecognize on the walks, smile, look them in the eye, and say hello. The \\r\\n\\t\\tworst thing that will happen is that you will become known as the young \\r\\n\\t\\tman who smiles and says hello, and that is not a bad thing to start \\r\\n\\t\\twith. You\\'ve been at a school with just boys. Most of you will be going to a \\r\\n\\t\\tschool with girls. I have no advice for you. The --\\r\\n\\t\\tThe last bit of advice I\\'ll give you is very simple, but I think it \\r\\n\\t\\tcould make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write \\r\\n\\t\\ta note to someone -- not an email, a note on a piece of paper. It will \\r\\n\\t\\ttake you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult. Let them tell you what a \\r\\n\\t\\tstamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope -- again, 10 minutes, once \\r\\n\\t\\ta week. I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you \\r\\n\\t\\tshould write. It will say: \"Dear\" -- fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School. Say: \"I have started at this new school. We \\r\\n\\t\\tare reading (blank) in English.\" \"Football\" (or) \"Soccer practice is hard, but \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'m enjoying it.\" \"Thank you for teaching me.\" Put it in an envelope. Put \\r\\n\\t\\ta stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who, for \\r\\n\\t\\treasons most of us cannot contemplate, have dedicated themselves to \\r\\n\\t\\tteaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take you exactly 10 \\r\\n\\t\\tminutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes \\r\\n\\t\\tto 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you \\r\\n\\t\\tdid, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. \\r\\n\\t\\tNo one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school. Enough advice. I would like to end by reading some important lyrics. I \\r\\n\\t\\tcited the Greek philosopher Socrates earlier. These lyrics are from the \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat American philosopher,Bob Dylan. They\\'re almost 50 years old. He \\r\\n\\t\\twrote them for his son, Jesse, who he was missing while he was on tour. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt lists the hopes that a parent might have for a son and for a \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughter. They\\'re also good goals for a son and a daughter. The wishes \\r\\n\\t\\tare beautiful. They\\'re timeless. They\\'re universal. They\\'re good and \\r\\n\\t\\ttrue, except for one: It is the wish that gives the song its title and \\r\\n\\t\\tits refrain. That wish is a parent\\'s lament. It\\'s not a good wish. So \\r\\n\\t\\tthese are the lyrics fromForever Youngby Bob Dylan:',\n",
       " 'Well, thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note, so I just wanted to \\r\\n\\t\\tperhaps make more of a statement than an -- give more of an explanation \\r\\n\\t\\tthan what amounts to be a traditional press interaction. Most Americans don\\'t know what happens when we lose one of our soldiers, \\r\\n\\t\\tsailors, airmen, Marines, our Coast Guardsmen, in combat. So let me tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou what happens: Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on \\r\\n\\t\\ta helicopter as a routine, and sends them home. Their first stop along \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way is when they\\'re packed in ice, typically at the -- at the airhead. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd \\r\\n\\t\\tthen they\\'re flown to, usually, Europe where they\\'re then packed in ice \\r\\n\\t\\tagain and flown toDover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the \\r\\n\\t\\tremains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with \\r\\n\\t\\tthe -- with the medals that they\\'ve earned, the emblems of their service, and then \\r\\n\\t\\tputs them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort \\r\\n\\t\\tthat takes them home. A very, very good movie to watch, if you haven\\'t ever seen it, is \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Taking Chance,\" where this is done in a movie -- HBO setting.Chance \\r\\n\\t\\tPhelpswas killed under my command right next to me, and it\\'s worth \\r\\n\\t\\tseeing that if you\\'ve never seen it. So that\\'s the process. While that\\'s happening, a casualty [notification] \\r\\n\\t\\tofficer \\r\\n\\t\\ttypically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom \\r\\n\\t\\tand dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening \\r\\n\\t\\tin two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different \\r\\n\\t\\tplaces. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family \\r\\n\\t\\tmember and stays with that family until -- well, for a long, long time, \\r\\n\\t\\teven after the internment. So that\\'s what happens. Who\\r\\n\\t\\tare these young men and women? They are the best 1 percent this country \\r\\n\\t\\tproduces. Most of you, as Americans, don\\'t know them. Many of you don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tknow anyone who knows any one of them. But they are the very best this \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry produces, and they volunteer to protect our country when there\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tnothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that self[less] \\r\\n\\t\\tservice to the nation is not only appropriate, but required. But that\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tall right. Who writes letters to the families? Typically, the company commander -- \\r\\n\\t\\tin my case, as a Marine -- the company commander, battalion commander, \\r\\n\\t\\tregimental commander, division commander, Secretary of Defense, \\r\\n\\t\\ttypically the service chief, commandant of the Marine Corps, and the \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident typically writes a letter. Typically, the only phone calls a family receives are the most important \\r\\n\\t\\tphone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my \\r\\n\\t\\tcase, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from \\r\\n\\t\\tAfghanistan, telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only \\r\\n\\t\\tphone calls that really matter. And yeah, the letters count, to a degree, but there\\'s not much that \\r\\n\\t\\treally can take the edge off what a family member is going through. So some Presidents have elected to call. All Presidents, I believe, have \\r\\n\\t\\telected to send letters. If you elect to call a family like this, it is \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the most difficult thing you could imagine. There\\'s no perfect way \\r\\n\\t\\tto make that phone call. When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, \\r\\n\\t\\tmy first recommendation was he not do it because it\\'s not the phone call \\r\\n\\t\\tthat parents, family members are looking forward to. It\\'s nice to do, in \\r\\n\\t\\tmy opinion, in any event. He asked me about previous Presidents, and I said, I can tell you that \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident Obama, who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active \\r\\n\\t\\tduty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to \\r\\n\\t\\tsimply say, I don\\'t believe President Obama called. That\\'s not a \\r\\n\\t\\tnegative thing. I don\\'t believe President Bush called in all cases. I \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t believe any President, particularly when the casualty rates are \\r\\n\\t\\tvery, very high -- that Presidents call. But I believe they all write. So when I gave that explanation to our President three days ago, he \\r\\n\\t\\telected to make phone calls in the case of thefour young men who were lost \\r\\n\\t\\tin Nigerat the earlier part of this month. But then he said, you know...\"How do you \\r\\n\\t\\tmake these calls?\" If you\\'re not in the family, if you\\'ve never worn the \\r\\n\\t\\tuniform, if you\\'ve never been in combat, you can\\'t even imagine how to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake that call. I think he very bravely does make those calls. The call in question that he made yesterday -- or day before yesterday \\r\\n\\t\\tnow -- were to four family members, the four fallen. And remember, \\r\\n\\t\\tthere\\'s a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he\\'s married, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s typically the -- the spouse. If he\\'s not married, that\\'s typically the \\r\\n\\t\\tparents unless the parents are divorced, and then he selects one of \\r\\n\\t\\tthem. If he didn\\'t get along with his parents, he\\x92ll -- he\\'ll select a sibling. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut the point is, the phone call is made to the -- the next-of-kinonlyif the \\r\\n\\t\\tnext-of-kin agrees to take the phone call. Sometimes they don\\'t. So a pre-call is made: \"The President of the United States\" or \"The \\r\\n\\t\\tcommandant of the Marine Corps,\" or someone \"would like to call.\" \"Will you \\r\\n\\t\\taccept the call?\" And typically, they all accept the call. So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe best way that he could. And he said to me, \"What do I say?\" I said to \\r\\n\\t\\thim, \"Sir, there\\'s nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these \\r\\n\\t\\tfamilies.\" Well, let me tell you what I told him. Let me tell you what my best \\r\\n\\t\\tfriend,Joe Dunford, told me -- because he was my casualty officer. He \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid, \"Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed.\" \\r\\n\\t\\t\"He knew what he was getting into by joining...that 1 percent.\" \"He knew what \\r\\n\\t\\tthe possibilities were because we\\'re at war.\" \"And when he died,\" -- in the \\r\\n\\t\\tfour cases we\\'re talking about, Niger, [and] my son\\'s case in Afghanistan \\r\\n\\t\\t-- when he died, \"he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends.\" That\\'s what the President tried to say to -- to four families the other day. I \\r\\n\\t\\twasstunnedwhen I came to work yesterday morning, and broken-hearted at \\r\\n\\t\\twhat I saw a member of Congress doing. A member of Congress who listened \\r\\n\\t\\tin on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young \\r\\n\\t\\twife, and in his way tried to express that opinion -- that he\\'s a brave \\r\\n\\t\\tman, a fallen hero, he knew what he was getting himself into because he \\r\\n\\t\\tenlisted. There\\'s no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he \\r\\n\\t\\twanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he \\r\\n\\t\\twanted to be with when his life was taken. That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted. It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that \\r\\n\\t\\tconversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was \\r\\n\\t\\tsacred. You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were \\r\\n\\t\\tsacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life, the dignity of life, is sacred. That\\'s gone. Religion, that seems \\r\\n\\t\\tto be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut I just thought -- the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman \\r\\n\\t\\tto die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred. And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she \\r\\n\\t\\twas doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to \\r\\n\\t\\tgo and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth. And you can \\r\\n\\t\\talways find them because they\\'re inArlington National Cemetery. I went \\r\\n\\t\\tover there for an hour-and-a-half, walked among the stones, some of whom \\r\\n\\t\\tI put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they \\r\\n\\t\\twere killed. I\\'ll end with this: In...October -- April, rather, of 2015, I was still on \\r\\n\\t\\tactive duty, and I went to thededication of the new FBI field office in \\r\\n\\t\\tMiami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in afirefight in \\r\\n\\t\\tMiamiwith -- against drug traffickers in 1986 -- a guy by the name of[Benjamin P.] Groganand Duke.1Grogan almost retired, 53 years old; Duke, I think less than a \\r\\n\\t\\tyear on the job. Anyways, they got in a gunfight and they were killed. \\r\\n\\t\\tThree other FBI agents were there, were wounded, now retired. So we \\r\\n\\t\\tgo down -- Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to \\r\\n\\t\\tthose fallen men and...to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve \\r\\n\\t\\tour country so well, and law enforcement so well. There were family members there. Some of the children that were there \\r\\n\\t\\twere only three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street \\r\\n\\t\\tin Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and \\r\\n\\t\\tgave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives. And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about \\r\\n\\t\\thow she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and \\r\\n\\t\\thow she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she \\r\\n\\t\\tjust called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money \\r\\n\\t\\t-- the 20 million dollars -- to build the building. And she sat down, and we \\r\\n\\t\\twere stunned, stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is \\r\\n\\t\\tthat empty a barrel, we were stunned. But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us \\r\\n\\t\\tstood up and were appalled. We just said, \"Okay, fine.\" So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat let\\'s not let this maybe last thing that\\'s held sacred in our \\r\\n\\t\\t-- in our society -- a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life \\r\\n\\t\\tfor our country -- let\\'s -- let\\'s try to somehow keep that -- keep that sacred. But it eroded \\r\\n\\t\\ta great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress. So I\\'m willing to take a question or two on this -- on this topic. Let me ask you \\r\\n\\t\\tthis -- Let me ask you this: Is anyone here a Gold Star parent or sibling? Does anyone here \\r\\n\\t\\tknow a Gold Star parent or sibling? Okay, you get the question.   Question:Well, thank you, General Kelly. First of all, we have a great deal of \\r\\n\\t\\trespect --Semper Fi-- for everything that you\\'ve ever done. But if we \\r\\n\\t\\tcould take this a bit further. Why were they in Niger? What was -- We were told they \\r\\n\\t\\tweren\\'t in armored vehicles and there was no air cover. So what are the \\r\\n\\t\\tspecifics about this particular incident? And why were we there? And why \\r\\n\\t\\tare we there? General Kelly:Well, I would start by saying there is an investigation. \\r\\n\\t\\tNow, let me back up and say, the fact of the matter is, young men and women \\r\\n\\t\\tthat wear our uniform are deployed around the world and there are tens \\r\\n\\t\\tof thousands, near the DMZ in North Korea [sic], in Okinawa, waiting to \\r\\n\\t\\tgo -- in South Korea -- in Okinawa, ready to go;\\xa0 all over the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates, training, ready to go. They\\'re all over Latin America. Down \\r\\n\\t\\tthere, they do mostly drug interdiction, working with our partners -- \\r\\n\\t\\tour great partners -- the Colombians, the Central Americans, the \\r\\n\\t\\tMexicans. You know, there\\'s thousands. My own son, right now, back in the fight \\r\\n\\t\\tfor his fifth tour in -- against ISIS. There\\'s thousands of them in Europe \\r\\n\\t\\tacting as a deterrent. And they\\'re throughout Africa. And they\\'re doing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe nation\\'s work there, and not making a lot of money, by the way, \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing it. They love what they do. So why were they there? They\\'re there working with partners, local -- \\r\\n\\t\\tall across Africa -- in this case, Niger -- working with partners, \\r\\n\\t\\tteaching them how to be better soldiers; teaching them how to respect \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights; teaching them how to fight ISIS so that we don\\'t have to \\r\\n\\t\\tsend our soldiers and Marines there in their thousands. That\\'s what they \\r\\n\\t\\twere doing there. Now, there is an investigation. There\\'s always a -- unless it\\'s a very, \\r\\n\\t\\tvery conventional death in a conventional war, there\\'s always an \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation. Of course, that operation is conducted byAFRICOMthat, \\r\\n\\t\\tof course, works directly for the Secretary of Defense. There is a -- and I talked to Jim Mattis this morning. I think he madestatementsthis afternoon. There\\'s an investigation ongoing. An \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestigation doesn\\'t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tmean people\\'s heads are going to roll. The fact is they need to find out \\r\\n\\t\\twhat happened and why it happened. But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand \\r\\n\\t\\tthat these young people -- sometimes old guys -- put on the uniform, go \\r\\n\\t\\tto where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large \\r\\n\\t\\tnumbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes they\\'re working \\r\\n\\t\\tin small units, working with our partners in Africa, Asia, Latin \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica, helping them be better. But at the end of the day, they\\'re helping those partners be better at \\r\\n\\t\\tfighting ISIS in North Africa to protect our country so that we don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\thave to send large numbers of troops. Any other -- someone who knows a Gold Star fallen person. John? Question:General, thank you for being here today and thank you for your service \\r\\n\\t\\t-- General Kelly:No, don\\'t -- question, \\r\\n\\t\\tplease. Question:--and for your family\\'s sacrifice. There has been some talk about the timetable of the release of the \\r\\n\\t\\tstatement about the -- I think at that point it was three soldiers who \\r\\n\\t\\twere killed in Niger. Can you walk us through the timetable of the \\r\\n\\t\\trelease of that information? And what part did the fact that a beacon \\r\\n\\t\\twas pinging during that time have to do with the release of the \\r\\n\\t\\tstatement? And were you concerned that divulging information early might \\r\\n\\t\\tjeopardize the soldiers\\' attempt at E&E.2 General Kelly:Yeah, first of all, that\\'s a -- you know, we are at the highest \\r\\n\\t\\tlevel of the U.S. government. The people that will answer those \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions will be the people at the other end of the military pyramid. I\\'m sure the Special Forces group is conducting it. I know they\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tconducting an investigation. That investigation, of course, under the \\r\\n\\t\\tauspices of AFRICOM, ultimately will go to the White -- go to the Pentagon. I\\'ve read the \\r\\n\\t\\tsame stories you have. I actually know a lot more than I\\'m letting on, \\r\\n\\t\\tso -- but I\\'m not going to tell you. There is an investigation being done. But as I say, the men and women of \\r\\n\\t\\tour country that are serving all around the world -- I mean, what, you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, what the \\r\\n\\t\\thell is my son doing back in the fight? He\\'s back in the fight because \\r\\n\\t\\t-- working with Iraqi soldiers who are infinitely better than they were \\r\\n\\t\\ta few years ago to take ISIS on directly so that we don\\'t have to do it. \\r\\n\\t\\tSmall numbers of Marines where he is -- working alongside those guys. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s why they\\'re out there, whether it\\'s Niger, Iraq, or whatever. We \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines, \\r\\n\\t\\tin particular, to go fight. I\\'ll take one more, but it\\'s got to be from someone who knows -- all \\r\\n\\t\\tright. Question:General, when you talk about Niger, sir, what does your intelligence \\r\\n\\t\\ttell you about the Russian connection with them? And the stories that \\r\\n\\t\\tare coming out now, they\\'re supporting -- General Kelly:I have no -- no knowledge of any Russian connection, but I was \\r\\n\\t\\tnot, in my position, to know that. That\\'s a question for NORTHCOM or for \\r\\n\\t\\t-- not NORTHCOM -- for AFRICOM or DOD. So, thanks very much, everybody. [crosstalk] As I walk off the stage, understand there\\'s tens of thousands of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican kids, mostly, doing their nation\\'s bidding all around the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld. They don\\'t have to be in uniform. You know, when I was a kid, \\r\\n\\t\\tevery man in my life was a veteran -- World War II, Korea, and there was \\r\\n\\t\\tthe draft. These young people today, they don\\'t do it for any other \\r\\n\\t\\treason than their selfless -- sense of selfless devotion to this great \\r\\n\\t\\tnation. We don\\'t look down upon those of you who that haven\\'t served. In fact, \\r\\n\\t\\tin a way we\\'re a little bit sorry because you\\'ll have never have \\r\\n\\t\\texperienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the \\r\\n\\t\\tkind of things our service men and women do -- not for any other reason \\r\\n\\t\\tthan they love this country. So just think of that. And I do appreciate your time. Take care.',\n",
       " 'Thank you so much, everybody. I apologize for being a few moments late. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere was a fire and then there was some traffic backed up, and so here \\r\\n\\t\\tI am and here are you, and thank you for being here. Let me begin by thanking our terrific U.S. Special Envoy for Climate \\r\\n\\t\\tChange Jonathan Pershing. I couldn\\x92t be luckier than to have him in this \\r\\n\\t\\tjob. He was over at the Energy Department for a while. We stole him from \\r\\n\\t\\tErnie Moniz, who is a great colleague and was gracious in my theft. And \\r\\n\\t\\the has done a spectacular job working with all of our international \\r\\n\\t\\tpartners as we begin the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd I also want to thank Ambassador Jennifer Haverkamp, who, along with \\r\\n\\t\\tJonathan and a lot of the team that I see sitting here, has done an \\r\\n\\t\\tabsolutely terrific job in leading the State Department\\x92s efforts to \\r\\n\\t\\tadvance our climate goals this year. And I have to tell you -- well, let \\r\\n\\t\\tme just divert for a minute. I also want to thank Brian Deese -- I don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tknow if he\\x92s here -- but I\\x92m grateful for President Obama\\x92s senior \\r\\n\\t\\tadvisor on climate issues and the entire intrepid U.S. delegation to the \\r\\n\\t\\tCOP, whom I had a chance to meet with earlier this morning, but we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tkind of traveled this road together. I also thank our international partners, and particularly the executive \\r\\n\\t\\tsecretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa; the outgoing president of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe COP, Minister Segolene Royal of France; and the incoming COP \\r\\n\\t\\tpresident, my friend and our host this week, Minister Salaheddine \\r\\n\\t\\tMezouar, the foreign minister of Morocco. And I also want to thank our \\r\\n\\t\\tpartners from Fiji, who will serve as president for the next COP, which \\r\\n\\t\\tI intend hopefully to attend as Citizen Kerry. It\\x92s a great pleasure for me to be able to be here in Marrakech. I\\x92m \\r\\n\\t\\treminded of one of the 20th century\\x92s most outsized figures whose \\r\\n\\t\\tconnection with this city is so famous -- Sir Winston Churchill. He loved \\r\\n\\t\\tto paint the landscapes here and to absorb the beauty and the culture. And in fact, at the very height of World War II, as he and President \\r\\n\\t\\tFranklin Roosevelt and Allied leaders gathered in Casablanca to plan the \\r\\n\\t\\tstrategy for the European Theater, Churchill was absolutely stunned to \\r\\n\\t\\tlearn that Roosevelt had never been to this part of Morocco. So in a move that perhaps only Winston Churchill would get away with in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe middle of a global war -- world war -- Churchill convinced Roosevelt \\r\\n\\t\\tto extend his visit and drive through what was still, at the time, a \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry engulfed in active combat. So after several hours on the loose, and because we\\x92re talking about \\r\\n\\t\\tWinston Churchill, plenty of Scotch -- the two leaders \\r\\n\\t\\tarrived in Marrakech in time to see the sun set on the Atlas Mountains. And Churchill said it was the loveliest view on Earth. So I think it\\x92s fitting, therefore, that almost three-quarters of a \\r\\n\\t\\tcentury later, friends and allies meet again in Marrakech in order to \\r\\n\\t\\tundertake a very important discussion -- a discussion about the natural \\r\\n\\t\\tworld that surrounds us and the importance of preserving it for \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerations to come. As Jonathan mentioned, climate change is deeply personal to me, but it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tpersonal to everyone in this room. I know that. And we obviously want it \\r\\n\\t\\tto be just as personal for everyone in every room: men, women, children, \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinesspeople, consumers, parents, teachers, students, grandparents. \\r\\n\\t\\tWherever we live, whatever our calling, whatever our background must be, \\r\\n\\t\\tthis is an imperative. Now, I know the danger of preaching to the choir -- and, obviously, all \\r\\n\\t\\tof us here are the proverbial choir. But I\\x92m actually grateful for that, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause here at the 22nd COP, no one can deny the remarkable progress \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we have made -- progress that actually was pretty hard to imagine \\r\\n\\t\\teven a few years ago. The global community is more united than ever not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust in accepting the challenge, but in confronting it with real action, \\r\\n\\t\\tin making a difference. And no one should doubt the overwhelming \\r\\n\\t\\tmajority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is \\r\\n\\t\\thappening and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made \\r\\n\\t\\tin Paris. None of us will forget the moment last December at Le Bourget, when the \\r\\n\\t\\tformer foreign minister of France, with Segolene and a bunch of you \\r\\n\\t\\tthere, led by our friend Laurent Fabius, who gaveled in the strongest, \\r\\n\\t\\tmost ambitious global climate agreement ever negotiated. It was an \\r\\n\\t\\taccord that took literally decades to achieve -- the proud work product \\r\\n\\t\\tof principled diplomacy, and ultimately, a deeply held, shared \\r\\n\\t\\tunderstanding that we\\x92re all in this together. And when we left Paris, no one rested on their laurels. Instead, the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld -- unified -- moved expeditiously to begin the -- to pull the \\r\\n\\t\\tagreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries representing 55 percent of global emissions, and doing so far \\r\\n\\t\\tfaster than even the most optimistic among us might have predicted. In a \\r\\n\\t\\tpowerful statement of the whole world\\x92s broad commitment to this \\r\\n\\t\\tagreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 \\r\\n\\t\\tpercent of the world\\x92s emissions have now formally committed to bold, \\r\\n\\t\\tdecisive action -- and we are determined to affirm that action and to \\r\\n\\t\\tstick with it out of Marrakech. Now, we have in place -- so we have in place a foundation, \\r\\n\\t\\tbased on national climate goals -- 109 nations, each of them have come up \\r\\n\\t\\twith their own plan, each of us setting goals that are based on our own \\r\\n\\t\\tabilities and our own circumstances. This agreement is, in fact, the \\r\\n\\t\\tessence of common but differentiated responsibilities. It provides \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport to countries that need help meeting the targets. It leaves no \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry to weather the storm of climate change alone. It marshals an \\r\\n\\t\\tarray of tools in order to help developing nations to invest in \\r\\n\\t\\tinfrastructure, technology, and the science to get the job done. It \\r\\n\\t\\tsupports the most vulnerable countries, so they can better adapt to the \\r\\n\\t\\tclimate impacts that many of those countries are already confronting. And finally, it enables us to ratchet up ambition over time as \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology develops and as the price of clean energy comes down. This is \\r\\n\\t\\tcritical: the agreement calls on the parties to revisit their national \\r\\n\\t\\tpledges every five years, in order to ensure that we keep pace with the \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology and that we accelerate the global transition to a clean \\r\\n\\t\\tenergy economy. This process -- a cornerstone of our agreement -- gives us a framework \\r\\n\\t\\tthat is built to last, and a degree of global accountability that has \\r\\n\\t\\tnever before existed. But I want to share with you that the progress \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we\\x92ve made this year goes well beyond Paris. In early October, the International Civil Aviation Organization \\r\\n\\t\\testablished a sector-wide agreement for carbon-neutral growth. Why is \\r\\n\\t\\tthis so important? Because international aviation wasn\\x92t covered by what \\r\\n\\t\\twe did in Paris, and if that aviation was a country, it would rank among \\r\\n\\t\\tthe top dozen greenhouse gas emitters in the world. A few weeks later, I was pleased to be in Kigali, Rwanda, when \\r\\n\\t\\trepresentatives from again nearly 200 countries came together to phase \\r\\n\\t\\tdown the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons -- which has \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen expected to increase very rapidly with a danger that is multiple of \\r\\n\\t\\ttimes more damaging than carbon dioxide. The Kigali agreement could \\r\\n\\t\\tsinglehandedly help us to avoid an entire half a degree centigrade of \\r\\n\\t\\twarming by the end of the century -- while at the same time opening up \\r\\n\\t\\tnew opportunities for growth in a range of industries. All of these steps combine to move the needle in the direction that we \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to. And in large part because global leaders have woken up to the \\r\\n\\t\\tenormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether towards a clean energy future. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded \\r\\n\\t\\tmore than six-fold. Last year, investment in renewable energy was at an \\r\\n\\t\\tall-time high -- nearly $350 billion. But that only tells you part of the \\r\\n\\t\\tstory. An average of -- that 350 billion is the first time that we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen able to see that money outpacing what is being put into fossil \\r\\n\\t\\tfuels. An average of half a million new solar panels were installed \\r\\n\\t\\tevery single day last year. And for the first time since the \\r\\n\\t\\tPre-Industrial Era, despite the fact that you have global prices of oil \\r\\n\\t\\tand gas and coal that are lower than ever, still more of the world\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tmoney was invested in renewable energy technologies than in new fossil \\r\\n\\t\\tfuel plants. And like many of you, I\\x92ve seen this transformation take hold in my own \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry. That\\x92s why I\\x92m confident about the future, regardless of what \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicy might be chosen, because of the marketplace. I\\x92ve met with \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders and innovators in the energy industry all across our nation, and \\r\\n\\t\\tI am excited about the path that they are on. America\\x92s wind generation \\r\\n\\t\\thas tripled since 2008 and that will continue, and solar generation has \\r\\n\\t\\tincreased 30 times over. And the reason both of those will continue is \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the marketplace will dictate that, not the government. I can tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou with confidence that the United States is right now, today, on our \\r\\n\\t\\tway to meeting all of the international targets that we\\x92ve set, and \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause of the market decisions that are being made, I do not believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthat that can or will be reversed. Now, much of this is due to President Obama\\x92s leadership, and our \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress also moving in a bipartisan fashion on things like tax credits \\r\\n\\t\\tfor renewable energy. This leadership has helped to inspire targeted \\r\\n\\t\\tinvestment from the private sector. Today our emissions are being driven \\r\\n\\t\\tdown because market-based forces are taking hold all over the world. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\x92s what we said we would do in Paris. None of us pretended that in \\r\\n\\t\\tParis, the agreement itself was going to achieve two degrees. What we \\r\\n\\t\\tknew is we were sending that critical message to the marketplace, and \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinesses have responded, as I just described. Most businesspeople have \\r\\n\\t\\tcome to understand: investing in clean energy simply makes good economic \\r\\n\\t\\tsense. You can make money. You can do good and do well at the same time. Now, significantly, the renewable energy boom isn\\x92t limited to \\r\\n\\t\\tindustrialized countries, and that\\x92s important to note. In fact, \\r\\n\\t\\temerging economies like China, India, and Brazil invested even more in \\r\\n\\t\\trenewable technologies last year than the developed world. China alone invested more than 100 billion dollars. Ultimately, clean \\r\\n\\t\\tenergy is expected to be a multitrillion dollar market -- the largest \\r\\n\\t\\tmarket the world has ever known. And no nation will do well if it sits \\r\\n\\t\\ton the sidelines, handicapping its new businesses from reaping the \\r\\n\\t\\tbenefits of the clean-tech explosion. My friends, we are in the midst of a global renewable energy surge, and \\r\\n\\t\\tas a result, in many places, clean energy has already reached cost \\r\\n\\t\\tparity with fossil fuels. Millions around the world are currently \\r\\n\\t\\temployed by the renewable energy industry. And if we make the right \\r\\n\\t\\tchoices, millions more people will be put to work. So good things are happening. The energy curve is bending towards \\r\\n\\t\\tsustainability. The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthat trend will only become more pronounced. Now, for those of us who have been working on this challenge for \\r\\n\\t\\tdecades, this really is a turning point. It is a cause for optimism, \\r\\n\\t\\tnotwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics and change. In no uncertain terms, the question now is not \\r\\n\\t\\twhether we will transition to energy economy -- to a clean energy \\r\\n\\t\\teconomy. That we\\x92ve already begun to do. The question now is whether or \\r\\n\\t\\tnot we are going to have the will to get this job done. That\\x92s the \\r\\n\\t\\tquestion now -- whether we will make the transition in time to be able to \\r\\n\\t\\tdo what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage. Ladies and gentlemen, I\\x92m not a Cassandra. You can tell from what I\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid. But I\\x92m a realist. Time is not on our side. The world is already \\r\\n\\t\\tchanging at an increasingly alarming rate with increasingly alarming \\r\\n\\t\\tconsequences. The last time that Morocco hosted the COP was in 2001, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe intervening 15 years have been among the 16 hottest years in \\r\\n\\t\\trecorded history. 2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every \\r\\n\\t\\tmonth so far has broken a record. And this year will contribute its \\r\\n\\t\\trecord-breaking heat to the hottest decade in recorded history, which \\r\\n\\t\\twas, by the way, preceded by the second-hottest decade, which was \\r\\n\\t\\tpreceded by the third hottest decade. At some point, even the strongest \\r\\n\\t\\tskeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening. We have seen record-breaking droughts everywhere -- from India to Brazil \\r\\n\\t\\tto the west coast of the United States. Storms that used to happen once \\r\\n\\t\\tevery 500 years are becoming relatively normal. In recent years, an \\r\\n\\t\\taverage of 22.5 million people have been displaced by extreme weather \\r\\n\\t\\tevents annually. We never saw that in the 20th Century. Communities in island states like Fiji have already been forced to take \\r\\n\\t\\tsteps to relocate permanently, because the places they have called home \\r\\n\\t\\tfor generations are now uninhabitable. And there are many, many more who \\r\\n\\t\\tknow it\\x92s only a matter of time before rising oceans begin to inundate \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir cities. I know this is a lot for anyone to process -- hard to process. That\\x92s why \\r\\n\\t\\tI have found that whenever possible, the best way to try to understand \\r\\n\\t\\tand to see whether people are pushing the envelope of thinking on this \\r\\n\\t\\tor not is to see for oneself what is happening. That\\x92s why this summer I \\r\\n\\t\\twent to Greenland to visit the incredible Jakobshavn glacier. Scientists \\r\\n\\t\\tpointed out to me the lines many meters above the water today that mark \\r\\n\\t\\tthe glacier\\x92s retreat which it has done more in the past 15 years than \\r\\n\\t\\tit did in the entire previous century. And while I was there, I boarded \\r\\n\\t\\ta Danish naval vessel and I traveled through the ice fjord. I saw the \\r\\n\\t\\tmassive ice chunks that had just broken off from the glacier to melt \\r\\n\\t\\tinexorably into the sea. And because they come off Greenland, which is \\r\\n\\t\\ton rock, every bit of that ice contributes to the rise of the ocean. Since the 1990s, the painful pace of that melting has nearly tripled. \\r\\n\\t\\tEvery day, 86 million metric tons of ice makes its way down that fjord \\r\\n\\t\\tinto the ocean. And the total flow that comes off that glacier in a \\r\\n\\t\\tsingle year is enough water to meet the needs of New York City for two \\r\\n\\t\\tdecades. But experts in Greenland and elsewhere have always warned me, and they \\r\\n\\t\\twarned me on this trip this summer, if you really want to understand \\r\\n\\t\\twhat\\x92s happening and what the threat is, go to Antarctica. Nowhere on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe planet are the stakes as high as they are on the opposite end of the \\r\\n\\t\\tglobe. For half a century, climate scientists have believed the West \\r\\n\\t\\tAntarctic Ice Sheet is a sword of Damocles hanging over our entire way \\r\\n\\t\\tof life. Should it break apart and melt into the sea, it alone could \\r\\n\\t\\traise global sea levels by four to five meters. And the scientists down \\r\\n\\t\\tthere described to me how the pressure of the ice and the weight of the \\r\\n\\t\\tice pushes the entire continent down so that it\\x92s grounded on the base \\r\\n\\t\\tof Earth\\x92s crust and rock. But that allows warmer sea water to creep in \\r\\n\\t\\tunder the glacier and speed up the process of the melting and \\r\\n\\t\\tdestabilize the glacier. Antarctica contains ice sheets that are, in some places, on the East \\r\\n\\t\\tAntarctic Ice Sheet three miles deep. And if all that ice were somehow \\r\\n\\t\\table to melt away completely because we are irresponsible about climate \\r\\n\\t\\tchange, in the coming centuries, sea level would rise somewhere over 100 \\r\\n\\t\\tto 200 feet. That\\x92s why I flew last week to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to meet \\r\\n\\t\\twith our scientists and to understand better what is taking place. I \\r\\n\\t\\tflew by helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. I walked out onto \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Ross Sea ice shelf. And I talked with the scientists who are on the \\r\\n\\t\\tfront lines, not people involved in day to day politics, but people who \\r\\n\\t\\tare making scientific judgment and doing extensive research. And they \\r\\n\\t\\twere crystal clear: The more they learn, the more alarmed they become \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the speed with which these changes are happening. A scientist from \\r\\n\\t\\tNew Zealand named Gavin Dunbar described what they\\x92re seeing there as \\r\\n\\t\\tthe quote, \\x93canary in the coal mine\\x94 and warned that some thresholds, if \\r\\n\\t\\twe cross them, cannot be reversed. In other words, we can\\x92t wait too long to translate the science that we \\r\\n\\t\\thave today into the policies that are necessary to address this \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenge. These scientists urged me to remind my own government and \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments around the world and everyone here that what we do right now \\r\\n\\t\\t-- today -- matters, because if we don\\x92t go far enough and if we don\\x92t go \\r\\n\\t\\tfast enough, the damage we inflict could take centuries to undo -- if it \\r\\n\\t\\tcan be undone at all. I underscore today: We don\\x92t get a second chance. The consequences of \\r\\n\\t\\tfailure would in most cases be irreversible. And if we lose this moment \\r\\n\\t\\tfor action, there\\x92s no speech decades from now that will put these \\r\\n\\t\\tmassive ice sheets back together. There\\x92s no magic wand in any capital \\r\\n\\t\\tin the world that you can wave to refill all of the lakes and rivers \\r\\n\\t\\tthat will dry up, or make farm -- arid farm land fertile again. And we \\r\\n\\t\\tcertainly won\\x92t have the power to hold back rising tides as they \\r\\n\\t\\tencroach on our shores. So we have to get this right, and we have to get \\r\\n\\t\\tit right now. The scientists in Antarctica told me that they are still trying to \\r\\n\\t\\tfigure out how quickly this is all happening. But they know for certain \\r\\n\\t\\tthat it\\x92s happening, and it\\x92s happening faster than we previously \\r\\n\\t\\tthought possible. The alarm bells ought to be going off everywhere. As \\r\\n\\t\\tan American glacial geologist told me down there, a fellow by the name \\r\\n\\t\\tof John Stone, he said, \\x93The catastrophic period could already be \\r\\n\\t\\tunderway.\\x94 That\\x92s why wise public policy demands that we take \\r\\n\\t\\tprecautionary measures now. Still, despite the real-life changes that are being done and the threat \\r\\n\\t\\tof more to come, it\\x92s important to remind ourselves that we are not on a \\r\\n\\t\\tpre-ordained path to disaster. This is not pre-ordained. It\\x92s not \\r\\n\\t\\twritten in the stars. This is about choices -- choices that we still \\r\\n\\t\\thave. This is a test of willpower, not capacity. It\\x92s within our power \\r\\n\\t\\tto put the planet back on a better track. But doing that requires \\r\\n\\t\\tholding ourselves accountable to the hard truth. It requires holding \\r\\n\\t\\tourselves accountable to facts, not opinion; to science, not theories \\r\\n\\t\\tthat haven\\x92t been proven and can\\x92t be proven; and certainly not to \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical bromides and slogans. For all the progress that we are making, at the current pace we will not \\r\\n\\t\\tmeet our goal. I said that earlier. We knew in Paris that what we were \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing was trying to start down a road. But we also knew it doesn\\x92t get \\r\\n\\t\\tus to the end of the journey. Yes, renewables make up more than half of \\r\\n\\t\\tall the new electricity installation last year. That\\x92s progress. But the \\r\\n\\t\\treality is because of the existing energy infrastructure already in \\r\\n\\t\\tplace, that new energy only generated a little more than 10 percent of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world\\x92s total energy. That is nowhere near what we need in order to \\r\\n\\t\\tachieve our goals. If we\\x92re going to have the ability to stave off the worst impacts of \\r\\n\\t\\tclimate change, we have to dramatically accelerate the transition that \\r\\n\\t\\tis already starting. We need to get to a point where clean sources are \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerating most of the world\\x92s energy, and we need to get there fast. \\r\\n\\t\\tCertainly experts tell us by the middle of this century we have to get \\r\\n\\t\\tthere. Now, I\\x92ve said many times, and I\\x92ll say it again today: It is not going \\r\\n\\t\\tto be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenge. The private sector is the most important player. And already \\r\\n\\t\\twe are seeing real solutions coming from entrepreneurs and academia. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\x92s going to be innovators, workers, and business leaders, many of whom \\r\\n\\t\\thave been hammering away at this challenge for years who are going to \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way that we power our world. But make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential. And \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause today is the last opportunity I will have to address the COP as \\r\\n\\t\\tSecretary of State, I just want to take a moment to underscore the work \\r\\n\\t\\tthat government leaders can do and should do, especially the 200 -- \\r\\n\\t\\talmost 200 nations represented here. Now, we know that we have not come to Marrakech to bask in the glow of \\r\\n\\t\\tParis. We\\x92ve come here to move forward. In doing so, we cannot forget \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the contributions we\\x92ve each made thus far were never meant to be \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ceiling. They\\x92re a foundation on which we expect to build. And \\r\\n\\t\\tunless our nations voluntarily ratchet up our ambition, and unless we \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to put sustained pressure on one another to act wisely, we will \\r\\n\\t\\thave difficulty meeting the current mitigation needs, let alone holding \\r\\n\\t\\ttemperature increases at 2 degrees warming, which science tells us is a \\r\\n\\t\\ttipping point. And if we fall short, it will be the single greatest instance in modern \\r\\n\\t\\thistory of a generation in a time of crisis abdicating responsibility \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the future. And it won\\x92t just be a policy failure; because of the \\r\\n\\t\\tnature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of \\r\\n\\t\\tdevastating consequence. Now, I know not -- that\\x92s not what any of us here signed up for. As Pope \\r\\n\\t\\tFrancis said, \\x93We receive this world as an inheritance from past \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerations, but also as a loan for future generations, to whom we will \\r\\n\\t\\thave to return it.\\x94 Now, I fully recognize the challenges that a number of countries face \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause they have a big population, they have a growing economy, they \\r\\n\\t\\thave a lot of people in poverty, they\\x92re determined to maintain \\r\\n\\t\\tstability and pull those people into the economy. And of course, they\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tconcerned about stability -- we all are. Access to affordable energy is a \\r\\n\\t\\tkey part of providing that stability. And the dirtiest sources of energy \\r\\n\\t\\tare, unfortunately, some of the cheapest. But I emphasize this: Only in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe short term. In the long term, it\\x92s an entirely different story, \\r\\n\\t\\tfolks. In the long term, carbon-intensive energy is actually today, \\r\\n\\t\\tright now, one of the costliest and most foolhardy investments any \\r\\n\\t\\tnation can possibly make. And that is because the final invoice for \\r\\n\\t\\tcarbon-based energy includes a lot more than just the price of the oil \\r\\n\\t\\tor the coal, or the natural gas; it -- or the price of building the power \\r\\n\\t\\tplant. The real cost accounting needs to fully consider all of the \\r\\n\\t\\tdownstream consequences, which, in the case of dirty fuels, are enough \\r\\n\\t\\tto at least double or triple the initial expenses. That\\x92s the kind of accounting that we need to do today. Just think about \\r\\n\\t\\tthe price of environmental and agricultural degradation. Think about the \\r\\n\\t\\tloss of an ability of farmers in one area because of the lack of water \\r\\n\\t\\tor too much heat to be able to grow their crops today. Think of the \\r\\n\\t\\thospital bills for asthma and emphysema patients, and the millions of \\r\\n\\t\\tdeaths that are linked to air pollution caused by the use of fossil \\r\\n\\t\\tfuels. In 2014, a study found that up to six million people in China have black \\r\\n\\t\\tlung because they lived and worked so close to coal-fired power plants. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere are nearly 20 million new asthma cases a year in India linked to \\r\\n\\t\\tcoal-related air pollution, and in the United States, asthma costs \\r\\n\\t\\ttaxpayers more than $55 billion annually. The greatest cause of children \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing hospitalized in the summer in the United States is environmentally \\r\\n\\t\\tinduced asthma. These are real costs, and they need to be added to the \\r\\n\\t\\ttally. We also have to include the price tag of rebuilding after devastating \\r\\n\\t\\tstorms and flooding. Just in the first three quarters of this year \\r\\n\\t\\talone, extreme weather events have cost the United States -- have cost \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican taxpayers $27 billion in damage. In August alone, Louisiana \\r\\n\\t\\texperienced flooding that resulted in roughly $10 billion worth of \\r\\n\\t\\tdamage. So none of us can afford to be oblivious to these expenses, and these \\r\\n\\t\\tinitial costs are in reality just a glimpse of what the future could \\r\\n\\t\\thold in store for us if we fail to respond. Just imagine: Sea barriers \\r\\n\\t\\tthat have to be built. Go down to Miami -- in south Miami, they\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tbuilding -- they\\x92re raising streets to deal with flooding that\\x92s already \\r\\n\\t\\toccurring, building new storm drains and assessing people additional tax \\r\\n\\t\\tin order to do it. Massive increases in cost of maintaining \\r\\n\\t\\tinfrastructure to control flooding, withstand storms. Power outages. All \\r\\n\\t\\tof this and more has to be added to any honest assessment of high-carbon \\r\\n\\t\\tenergy sources. And in an age of increasing transparency and public \\r\\n\\t\\tdemand for accountability, citizens in the long run will not accept \\r\\n\\t\\tphony accounting or an obfuscation of the consequences of the decisions. So everyone needs to make smarter choices -- with the long game, not the \\r\\n\\t\\tshort game, in mind. Coal, unfortunately, is the single biggest contributor to global carbon \\r\\n\\t\\tpollution. It provides about 30 percent of the world\\x92s energy, but it \\r\\n\\t\\tproduces nearly 50 percent of the world\\x92s greenhouse gases. The \\r\\n\\t\\tunprecedented investments that we are now seeing in clean energy will \\r\\n\\t\\tmean very, very little if, at the same time, new coal fire plants \\r\\n\\t\\twithout carbon capture are coming online and at a rate dumping into the \\r\\n\\t\\tatmosphere more and more of the very pollution that we\\x92re all working so \\r\\n\\t\\thard to reduce. Some of these projections, I have to tell you, are deeply troubling. For \\r\\n\\t\\texample, between now and 2040, the demand for electricity in Southeast \\r\\n\\t\\tAsia is likely to triple -- and the bulk of that demand is currently \\r\\n\\t\\texpected to be met by growth -- where? In the coal-fired power sector, \\r\\n\\t\\trather than clean energy. That threatens everything we\\x92re trying to \\r\\n\\t\\tachieve here. We literally cannot use one hand to pat ourselves on the back for what \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92ve done to take steps to address climate change, and then turn around \\r\\n\\t\\tand use the other hand to write a big fat check enabling the widespread \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment of the dirtiest source of fuel in an outdated way. It just \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\x92t make sense. That\\x92s suicide. And that\\x92s how we all lose this \\r\\n\\t\\tfight. Make no mistake: People all over the world are working for victory in \\r\\n\\t\\tthis. And this issue is increasingly capturing the attention of citizens \\r\\n\\t\\teverywhere, and certainly the private sector. The private sector \\r\\n\\t\\twelcomed the signals that we sent in Paris, but they are demanding even \\r\\n\\t\\tstronger signals now -- the private sector -- so that they can invest \\r\\n\\t\\tclean energy solutions with even greater confidence. One of the strongest signals that government can send, one of the most \\r\\n\\t\\tpowerful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest possible course -- cost \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tis to move toward carbon pricing that puts basic, free-market economics \\r\\n\\t\\tto work in addressing this challenge. Now obviously, this is not a new idea. Many have come to this conclusion \\r\\n\\t\\talready. The share of global emissions that are covered by a carbon \\r\\n\\t\\tprice has tripled over the last decade. Last year, more than 1,000 \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinesses and investors -- including sectors that might be surprising to \\r\\n\\t\\tsome of you -- all came together to voice their support for carbon \\r\\n\\t\\tpricing. The long list of supporters includes energy companies like BP, \\r\\n\\t\\tRoyal Dutch Shell, utilities like PG&E, transportation companies like \\r\\n\\t\\tBritish Airways, construction firms like Cemex, financial institutions \\r\\n\\t\\tlike Deutsche Bank, like Swiss Re, and consumer goods corporations like \\r\\n\\t\\tUnilever and Nokia. These companies all believe that carbon pricing will \\r\\n\\t\\testablish the necessary certainty in the marketplace that helps the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivate sector to move the capital that helps to solve the problem. Carbon pricing allows citizens, innovators, and companies -- it allows \\r\\n\\t\\tthe market to make independent decisions free from the government to be \\r\\n\\t\\table to best drive their emission reductions. And this is also, by the \\r\\n\\t\\tway, the chief reason that carbon pricing has received support from \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders and economists on both sides of the aisle in the United States \\r\\n\\t\\tof America. A price on carbon, coupled with government support for \\r\\n\\t\\tinnovation in key sectors, is easily one of the most compelling tools \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the world to accelerate the clean energy transformation that we are \\r\\n\\t\\tworking to achieve. Now, while it may be some time before we see this \\r\\n\\t\\tideal outcome, the effort to improve carbon markets ought to be a \\r\\n\\t\\tpriority going forward. The bottom line is that there are many tools at the world\\x92s disposal. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe COP itself is an important tool, in a sense. It has become much more \\r\\n\\t\\tof a -- much more than just a gathering of government officials. It\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\treally a yearly summit, 25,000 people strong this year from all over the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld, for all sectors to showcase their commitment to climate action \\r\\n\\t\\tand to discuss ways to expand shared efforts. It\\x92s a regular reminder of \\r\\n\\t\\texactly how much this movement has grown -- and how many people, in how \\r\\n\\t\\tmany countries, are committed to action. Walking around the conference here before I was coming in here and \\r\\n\\t\\tseeing this site in Marrakech, and seeing the delegations and the \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness leaders, the entrepreneurs and the activists who have traveled \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom near and far to be here, it\\x92s abundantly clear we have the ability \\r\\n\\t\\tto prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But again, we\\x92re forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because \\r\\n\\t\\tour success is not going to happen by accident. It won\\x92t happen without \\r\\n\\t\\tsustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. And it \\r\\n\\t\\twon\\x92t happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd it certainly won\\x92t happen without leadership. For those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may \\r\\n\\t\\tbe confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical \\r\\n\\t\\tjuncture, I ask you, on behalf of billions of people around the world: \\r\\n\\t\\tDon\\x92t take my word for it. Don\\x92t take just the existence of this COP as \\r\\n\\t\\tthe stamp of approval for it. I ask you to see for yourselves. Do your \\r\\n\\t\\town due diligence before making irrevocable choices. Examine closely what it is that has persuaded the Pope, presidents, and \\r\\n\\t\\tprime ministers all over the world, leaders around the world, to take on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe responsibility of responding to this threat. Talk to the business \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders of Fortune 500 companies and smaller innovative companies, all \\r\\n\\t\\tof whom are eager to invest in the energy markets of the future. Get the \\r\\n\\t\\tbest economists\\x92 judgment on the risk of inaction, of what the cost \\r\\n\\t\\twould be to global economies, versus the opportunities that are to be \\r\\n\\t\\tfound in the clean energy market of the future. Speak with the military \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders who view climate change as a global security concern, as a \\r\\n\\t\\tthreat multiplier. Ask farmers about -- and fisherman about the impact of \\r\\n\\t\\tdramatic changes in weather patterns on their current ability to make a \\r\\n\\t\\tliving and to support their families or on what they see for the future. \\r\\n\\t\\tListen to faith leaders talk about the moral responsibility that human \\r\\n\\t\\tbeings have to act as stewards of the planet that we have to share, the \\r\\n\\t\\tonly planet we have. Bring in the activists and civil society, groups \\r\\n\\t\\twho have worked for years with communities all over the world to raise \\r\\n\\t\\tawareness and to respond to this threat. Ask young people about their \\r\\n\\t\\tlegitimate concerns for the planet that their children will inherit in \\r\\n\\t\\treducing emissions worldwide. And above all, consult with the scientists who have dedicated their \\r\\n\\t\\tentire lives to expanding our understanding of this challenge, and whose \\r\\n\\t\\twork will be in vain unless we sound the alarm loud enough for everyone \\r\\n\\t\\tto hear. No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople based on solely ideology or without proper input. Anyone who has these conversations, who takes the time to learn from \\r\\n\\t\\tthese experts, who gets the full picture of what we\\x92re facing -- I \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve they can only come to one legitimate decision, and that is to \\r\\n\\t\\tact boldly on climate change and encourage others to do the same. Now, I want to acknowledge that since this COP started, obviously, an \\r\\n\\t\\telection took place in my country. And I know it has left some here and \\r\\n\\t\\telsewhere feeling uncertain about the future. I obviously understand \\r\\n\\t\\tthat uncertainty. And while I can\\x92t stand here and speculate about what \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the \\r\\n\\t\\ttime that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned \\r\\n\\t\\tis that some issues look a little bit different when you\\x92re actually in \\r\\n\\t\\toffice compared to when you\\x92re on the campaign trail. And the truth is that climate change shouldn\\x92t be a partisan issue in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe first place. It isn\\x92t a partisan issue for our military leaders at \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Pentagon who call climate change a threat multiplier. It \\r\\n\\t\\tisn\\x92t a partisan issue for those military leaders because of the way \\r\\n\\t\\tthat climate change exacerbates conflicts all over the world and who \\r\\n\\t\\tview it as a threat to military readiness at their bases and could \\r\\n\\t\\tsuffer the consequences of rising seas and stronger storms. It isn\\x92t a \\r\\n\\t\\tpartisan issue for our intelligence community, who just this year \\r\\n\\t\\treleased a report detailing the implications of climate change for U.S. \\r\\n\\t\\tnational security: threats to the stability of fragile nations, \\r\\n\\t\\theightened social and political tensions, rising food prices, increased \\r\\n\\t\\trisks to human health, and more. It isn\\x92t a partisan issue for mayors from New Orleans to Miami, who are \\r\\n\\t\\talready working hard to manage sunny-day floods and stronger storm \\r\\n\\t\\tsurges caused by climate change. It isn\\x92t partisan for liberal and \\r\\n\\t\\tconservative business leaders alike who are investing unprecedented \\r\\n\\t\\tamounts of money into renewables, voluntarily committing to reduce their \\r\\n\\t\\town emissions, and even holding their supply chains accountable to their \\r\\n\\t\\toverall carbon footprint. And there\\x92s nothing partisan about climate change for the world \\r\\n\\t\\tscientists who are near unanimous in their conclusion that climate \\r\\n\\t\\tchange is real, it is happening, human beings for the most part are \\r\\n\\t\\tcausing it, and we will have increasing catastrophic impacts on our way \\r\\n\\t\\tof life if we don\\x92t take the dramatic steps necessary to reduce the \\r\\n\\t\\tcarbon footprint of our civilization. Now, whether we are able to meet this moment is a big test -- probably as \\r\\n\\t\\tbig a test of courage and vision as you\\x92ll ever find. Every nation has a \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibility to do its part if we are going to pass that test -- and \\r\\n\\t\\tonly those nations who step up and respond to this threat can \\r\\n\\t\\tlegitimately lay claim to a mantle of global leadership. That\\x92s a fact. More than his love of Marrakech, Winston Churchill was known for his \\r\\n\\t\\thard-nosed insight and the way that he expressed it. He once argued, \\r\\n\\t\\ttellingly: \\x93It\\x92s not always enough that we do our best; sometimes we \\r\\n\\t\\thave to do what is required.\\x94 We know today what is required. And with all of the real-world evidence, \\r\\n\\t\\twith all of the peer-reviewed science, with all of the plain just old \\r\\n\\t\\tcommon sense, there isn\\x92t anyone who can credibly argue otherwise. So we \\r\\n\\t\\thave to continue this fight, my friends. We have to continue to defy \\r\\n\\t\\texpectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to \\r\\n\\t\\ta clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another \\r\\n\\t\\taccountable for the choices that our nations makes. Earlier this year, on Earth Day, I had the great privilege of signing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Paris Agreement on behalf of President Obama and the United States. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt was a special day. And because my daughter lives in New York, I \\r\\n\\t\\tinvited her to join me at the UN. She surprised me by bringing my \\r\\n\\t\\t2-year-old granddaughter, Isabelle, along as well. And that morning, I had been thinking about the history that had brought \\r\\n\\t\\tus to that day. I thought about the first Earth Day in 1970 that I \\r\\n\\t\\tmentioned earlier, when I joined with millions of Americans in teach-ins \\r\\n\\t\\tto educate the public about the environmental challenges we faced. I \\r\\n\\t\\tthought about the first UN climate conference in Rio, which is actually \\r\\n\\t\\twhere I met my wife Teresa, and I thought of the urgency that we all \\r\\n\\t\\tfelt way back then in 1992. And of course, I thought about that December \\r\\n\\t\\tnight at Le Bourget, when it seemed -- for the first time -- that the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld had finally found the path forward. But as I sat and I played with my granddaughter, waiting for my turn to \\r\\n\\t\\tgo out and sign the Agreement, I thought, not of the past, but I thought \\r\\n\\t\\tof the future. Her future. The world her children would one day inherit. And when it was time for me to go up on that stage, I scooped her up and \\r\\n\\t\\tI brought her out with me. I wanted to share that moment with her. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92ll never forget it. But to my surprise, people responded to her presence that day, and since \\r\\n\\t\\tthen so many people have said to me, they\\x92ve conveyed to me how that \\r\\n\\t\\tmoment conveyed something special and moved them. They told me they \\r\\n\\t\\tthought of their own children, their own grandchildren. They thought of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe future. They were reminded of the stakes. Ladies and gentlemen, here in Marrakech, in the next hours, let us make \\r\\n\\t\\tclear to the world that we will always remember the stakes. Let us stand \\r\\n\\t\\tfirm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves \\r\\n\\t\\tto double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to \\r\\n\\t\\tclimate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as \\r\\n\\t\\tWinston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required. I look forward to working with you in this important work for whatever \\r\\n\\t\\tnumber of years ahead I have a chance to. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Thanks, Jake, it\\x92s great to be here. I want to thank Slate and Arizona State University for sponsoring today\\x92s conversation on Internet freedom, which I believe is one of the game-changing human rights issues of our time. And I want to thank Andres Martinez for inviting me here. I get a lot of speaking invitations these days. But most of them are less cool. Usually the cool invitations go to Ian Schuler, our resident techie in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Ian will be speaking later this afternoon on a panel with Sascha Meinrath about the \\x93Internet in a suitcase\\x94 program that the State Department is funding here at New America. I\\x92m particularly pleased to see here today so many thought leaders, policymakers, journalists, techies and activists. All of you have helped shape this conversation and many have helped governments, including our own, come to grips with the challenges and opportunities posed by these transformational new technologies. We\\x92re excited about the \\x93internet in a suitcase\\x94 project, one of a number of cutting-edge technologies and projects that we\\x92re investing in. It\\x92s part of what Secretary of State Clinton calls a \\x93venture capital approach\\x94 to addressing the wide range of challenges that democracy and human rights activists are facing in Internet repressive environments around the world. By the end of this year, my bureau will have led the effort within the US government to award $70 million in grants. We\\x92re supporting a dozen different circumvention technologies:\\xa0 a \\x93panic button\\x94 app for mobile phones; a \\x93slingshot\\x94 program to identify censored content that users are searching for in a particular country and fling it back over firewalls where ordinary citizens can get it; and training programs to help activists operating in repressive areas to keep operating, thwart surveillance and protect their privacy. In short, we\\x92re funding a whole slew of tools and techniques that empower users to gain access to information, organize them, tell their own stories and stay safe online. But this is not just about technology. Secretary Clinton has put Internet freedom on the map as a key diplomatic priority, in our bilateral relationships and in multilateral institutions, including the UN Human Rights Council, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which just held a ministerial on these issues a few weeks ago, and others. Many of you here today have urged us to not view Internet freedom in isolation, but to wrestle with the challenge of integrating Internet freedom with national security, combating cyber crime, protecting intellectual property, and other vital interests. This is what we\\x92ve done in President Obama\\x92s International Strategy for Cyberspace, which incorporates all of these legitimate interests. This is the hard part \\x96 it\\x92s where Americans disagree not only with repressive governments but amongst ourselves. But we all agree on the importance of getting it right. By now, every government understands the power of ordinary citizens to harness the Internet and social media to organize and express themselves. Some have embraced these new technologies as a way to connect with and serve their citizens. Others are redoubling their attempts to control them. We are seeing the development of more sophisticated tools for cyber-repression, including filtering, surveillance, anti-circumvention, and network-disabling technologies by government security forces in closed societies. We\\x92re also witnessing the rise of cyber attacks on the computers of independent media, Distributed Denial of Service attacks on the sites of watchdog groups, and other attempts to thwart the work of civil society. Before I joined this administration, I spent 30 years working on human rights issues from the low-tech NGO side. So today I want to refocus attention not on the technologies to fight Internet repression, but on the psychology of the repressors. What causes a regime to perceive the Internet as such a profound threat that it is willing to damage its country\\x92s economy by choking bandwidth, blocking content or even shutting down the network entirely? These are the acts of governments that fear their own people. In cracking down on the Internet, they expose their own lack of legitimacy. But these crackdowns also indicate a basic lack of understanding that free speech \\x96 whether it\\x92s supportive speech or subversive speech \\x96 is harder than ever to suppress in the Digital Age. And the young people who have taken to the streets across the Arab world this year understand that it isn\\x92t pornography or pirating that is being suppressed. It\\x92s people. It\\x92s their demands for dignity and a say in the political and economic future of their countries. After all, Facebook does not foment dissent; people do. Twitter only amplifies those voices that have the most resonance, those ideas that people find most powerful. As President Obama said in a speech in Cairo in June 2009 -- 19 months before the protests in Tahrir Square -- \\x93Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\\x94 Two billion people now have access to the Internet. That\\x92s a lot of speech to try to suppress. In the next 20 years, nearly 5 billion more people will come online. Will they be joining a true global conversation over a single, unified global network? Or will they be entering a stilted alternative reality of government-approved content on controlled national intranets? This is the vision of the \\x93halal\\x94 Internet being advocated by some in Iran, a course that would only deepen the country\\x92s isolation and the Iranian authorities\\x92 estrangement from their own citizens. So let\\x92s be honest: Governments that respect the rights of their citizens have no reason to fear a free Internet. The Internet didn\\x92t topple the governments of Tunisia or Egypt; their people did. But smart governments are using social media tools to better communicate with and understand their own people -- and to deliver services in a more open and accountable fashion. And they are recognizing that free access to tech tools spurs both social and economic progress. If you really want to address popular discontent, you don\\x92t need an army of censors deleting posts on social media sites. You need a cadre of government officials reading those posts and figuring out how to identify and address the legitimate grievances that are being expressed there. So don\\x92t shoot the instant messenger! Instead, address the underlying grievances -- the corruption, the abuse of power, the environmental degradation, the lack of political and economic opportunity, the daily affronts to dignity by indifferent authorities. More than anything else, it is this quest for dignity that has prompted so many young people to walk away from their keyboards and into the streets to demand a chance to build a better future. And it is their vision of the future that matters. This administration is working to support them. Our work on Internet freedom is not about messaging; it\\x92s about empowerment. It is up to all the people of each country to build societies in which governments respect not some rights part of the time, but all of the rights of the governed, every day. The role of the international community is to offer support -- technological and institutional. Your generation \\x96 the digital natives -- has developed new tools with unprecedented potential to empower people around the world to participate in a truly democratic process. The world is eager to see what you will invent next. But we\\x92re equally eager for your help in forging international consensus and setting the expectations needed to support Internet freedom. It will be up to your generation to make this vision a reality for the 5 billion users \\x96 by setting the rules of the road on the Internet for the 21st century. The human challenge of Internet freedom is to use technological tools to build a different kind of relationship between citizens, civil society and their governments -- a relationship based not merely upon the consent of the governed, but upon broad participation in governance by all citizens. With your help, we will continue to put U.S. diplomatic power behind that vision of a more inclusive, peaceful and democratic world. Thank you.',\n",

He mentioned in his introduction the \\r\\n\\t\\ttime we were able to spend over the Pickles Research Center. What an \\r\\n\\t\\textraordinary place, what extraordinary people. And what really struck \\r\\n\\t\\tme this morning was that while Texas is obviously so well known as the \\r\\n\\t\\toil-producing part of America and has built its reputation on that for \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, it really is now the energy-producing center of America. And what \\r\\n\\t\\tyou are doing with respect to research on solar and wind, alternative, \\r\\n\\t\\trenewable, is exactly what President Obama and I and others hoped would \\r\\n\\t\\thappen in the context of our efforts on global climate change and the \\r\\n\\t\\tagreement we signed in Paris. The agreement, obviously, is not going to \\r\\n\\t\\tguarantee we meet a 2 degrees centigrade increase in temperature, but \\r\\n\\t\\twhat it is going to do is send a message to the marketplace exciting the \\r\\n\\t\\tallocation of capital, exciting our next Thomas Edison or Bill Gates or \\r\\n\\t\\tSteve Jobs to find a way to have battery storage or some cheaper form of \\r\\n\\t\\ta solar cell, and that is the way we\\'re going to solve this problem. And \\r\\n\\t\\tUniversity of Texas is going to contribute to that significantly. So, \\r\\n\\t\\tGreg, thank you for what you\\'re doing. I want to add my voice to that of so many people here who I know \\r\\n\\t\\tbeforehand have always -- have been praising what Ken Burns has done and \\r\\n\\t\\this contributions to the study of history and the art of documentary \\r\\n\\t\\tfilm. I listened in the corner there to the conversation that was taking \\r\\n\\t\\tplace. It was absolutely fascinating -- honest, which is important, on \\r\\n\\t\\tthis topic. And I thought immediately that what I need to do is not give \\r\\n\\t\\tsome long, quote, \"keynote\" address as it is billed, but just try to \\r\\n\\t\\tshare a few quick observations with you, and then have the time to be \\r\\n\\t\\table to have Ken grill me and we can have a good conversation. And I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink that might be a little bit more productive and rewarding for \\r\\n\\t\\teverybody. But his unbelievable accomplishments on Brooklyn Bridge, the \\r\\n\\t\\tconservation of our National Parks, the epic narrative of the Civil War, \\r\\n\\t\\this new -- his latest film on Jackie Robinson, his film on baseball -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthis guy really taps into the pulse of our nation and has a way of \\r\\n\\t\\tpresenting it that is just absolutely sheer delight -- subtle, brilliant, \\r\\n\\t\\thonest. And I am absolutely more than confident that the extraordinary \\r\\n\\t\\ttime and the passion that has consumed this particular project means the \\r\\n\\t\\tfinal product is not only going to be a work of art -- and you heard him; \\r\\n\\t\\tI mean, they\\'re changing a word or two after it\\'s locked -- it\\'s going to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe the definitive examination of Vietnam, with profound impact not only \\r\\n\\t\\ton the way that America thinks about that war, but I think on America\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tengagement with the issue of war itself. And I think it will do so for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe better. I know that this conference and tonight this topic, these couple of \\r\\n\\t\\tdays, call for a serious analysis of what happened and why -- it\\'s about \\r\\n\\t\\thistory. But it\\'s also about us, about our heart and soul and our gut; \\r\\n\\t\\tabout how wrenching it was in the ways that Lynn and Ken just described \\r\\n\\t\\tto you. And this examination should help us to understand Santayana\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tfamous warning to those who don\\'t heed the lessons of the past. So I \\r\\n\\t\\tlook forward when I finish to a good exchange, but to lay the groundwork \\r\\n\\t\\tfor that conversation let me make a few key points that I think are key \\r\\n\\t\\tin the context of this conference that might not otherwise surface as we \\r\\n\\t\\tare principally looking backwards. First, those who expressed concern about the way the war in Southeast \\r\\n\\t\\tAsia was conducted were, I think this film will show, clearly justified \\r\\n\\t\\tin those concerns. I am not going to dredge up all of the old arguments \\r\\n\\t\\t-- that is well-trodden ground by myself and by others, including I \\r\\n\\t\\tthought quite definitively by Neil Sheehan, whose book title sums it up. \\r\\n\\t\\tAs I know we\\'re going to be reminded by Ken\\'s documentary, there were \\r\\n\\t\\tmistakes in leadership, mistakes in communication, mistakes in strategy. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere were huge mistakes in the basic assumptions about the war. So it \\r\\n\\t\\tis not a surprise that public support virtually disappeared at a \\r\\n\\t\\tcritical point of time. And we can talk about that a little bit. My second point is that the confusion that some Americans showed in \\r\\n\\t\\tblaming the warriors for the war itself was tragically misplaced. Our \\r\\n\\t\\tveterans did not receive the welcome home.\\xa0 Our veterans did \\r\\n\\t\\tnot receive either the welcome home nor the benefits nor the treatment \\r\\n\\t\\tthat they not only deserved, but needed, and the fundamental contract \\r\\n\\t\\tbetween soldier and government simply was not honored. As a result, the \\r\\n\\t\\tvets themselves had to go out and fight a whole new round of battles. I \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that well, as one of the four co-founders of the Vietnam Veterans \\r\\n\\t\\tof America. They had to fight to get an increase in the GI Bill; fight \\r\\n\\t\\tto deal with homelessness and trauma; fight to have the ultimate \\r\\n\\t\\tsacrifice of their buddies memorialized on America\\'s National Mall. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI thank Jan Scruggs for his extraordinary leadership with respect to \\r\\n\\t\\tthat. So when we talk about Vietnam, to me, here is lesson number one: Whether \\r\\n\\t\\ta war is popular or unpopular, or it\\'s not even what we call a war but a \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict, we must always -- always -- treat our returning vets with the \\r\\n\\t\\tdignity and the respect that they have earned by virtue of their service \\r\\n\\t\\tto our nation. My third and final point is that we were right to work hard, and in some \\r\\n\\t\\tcases we still are working, to move forward from the pain and the \\r\\n\\t\\tdivision of the war to begin a process of healing both within our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry and between the United States and Vietnam. We were right to think about what had gone wrong and to enact laws that \\r\\n\\t\\tshed greater light on how our government goes about its business. We \\r\\n\\t\\twere right to take steps to help Amerasian children and to welcome the \\r\\n\\t\\tmany thousands of Vietnamese refugees following the fall of Saigon. Our \\r\\n\\t\\tSupreme Court was right to uphold the publication of the Pentagon \\r\\n\\t\\tPapers, so that more of the truth about the war would be revealed. And \\r\\n\\t\\twe were right -- and we were right to pursue a full \\r\\n\\t\\taccounting of our fellow citizens who were missing or unaccounted for, \\r\\n\\t\\teven after our POWs returned to our shores. Now, let me say a word, if I can, about this accounting. It\\'s not a \\r\\n\\t\\twell-known story in America, but it should be. For those of us -- John \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain and myself particularly as we approach the issue of normalization \\r\\n\\t\\twith Vietnam -- the accounting for POW/MIA was absolutely a prerequisite \\r\\n\\t\\tand non-negotiable. But this process of accounting, frankly, tells you \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething not only about us as Americans and our keeping faith with \\r\\n\\t\\tthose who fall in battle; it also tells you something quite remarkable \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the extraordinary openness of the Vietnamese people, who helped us \\r\\n\\t\\tsearch for the remains of our fallen troops even as the vast majority of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheirs -- a million strong probably -- would never be found. They allowed \\r\\n\\t\\thelicopters to land once again unannounced in hamlets that brought back \\r\\n\\t\\tbitter memories of the war itself, and I remember negotiating with them \\r\\n\\t\\tto permit us to do that because we had to have the element of surprise \\r\\n\\t\\tin order to prove to people they weren\\'t moving people from where they \\r\\n\\t\\twere being kept. But the Vietnamese did so because they wanted also to \\r\\n\\t\\tmove beyond the war. They dug up their fields and let us into their \\r\\n\\t\\thomes, their \"history houses,\" their jails. On more than one occasion, \\r\\n\\t\\tthey guided us across what were actually minefields. And even today as I \\r\\n\\t\\tstand here, thanks to a process that was fully embraced by President \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorge H.W. Bush, with whom I had the pleasure of visiting yesterday in \\r\\n\\t\\tHouston -- one of the greatest people in America -- and General Brent \\r\\n\\t\\tScowcroft -- together we were able to engage in what has become, my \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends, the single most significant, most comprehensive, most \\r\\n\\t\\texhaustive accounting of the missing and dead in any war in the history \\r\\n\\t\\tof humankind. And I think the United States should be very proud of \\r\\n\\t\\tthat. Literally, we have people over there still today as we sit here working \\r\\n\\t\\tto complete that task of accountability. And I have to tell you, having \\r\\n\\t\\tflown in a Russian helicopter, which was an experience of holding your \\r\\n\\t\\tbreath for hours, across Vietnam and landing in these places, I remember \\r\\n\\t\\twalking down 20 feet deep into a pit that had been dug by archeologists, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause it was the crash site of a C-130, and literally looking at the \\r\\n\\t\\twall of mud in which there was the detritus of the C-130 looking for the \\r\\n\\t\\tremains in order to bring them home and repatriate them. That is the \\r\\n\\t\\tdepths and extent to which we currently go. Now, to be clear -- and I want to emphasize this here today -- certainly \\r\\n\\t\\tfor me, and I think for most veterans, whatever their feelings were \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the war, about what happened in America around the war, the \\r\\n\\t\\tprocess of reconciliation and restoring diplomatic ties was not about \\r\\n\\t\\tforgetting. If we forget, we cease to learn. And the tragedy of what \\r\\n\\t\\thappened in Vietnam has to be a constant reminder of the capacity to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake mistakes, the capacity to see things in the wrong lens, the \\r\\n\\t\\tcapacity to miss the signals, and ultimately to miss the constant \\r\\n\\t\\treminder of the horror and the suffering that war inflicts. But neither should we become the prisoners of history. And I want you just to think for a moment -- this is what I thought was a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle different from where we\\'d be otherwise, and I will go, I\\'m sure, \\r\\n\\t\\tin the conversation with Ken. I want you to consider how far we have \\r\\n\\t\\tcome since normalization. Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 60,000 American visitors \\r\\n\\t\\tannually to Vietnam. Today, there are nearly half a million. Twenty years ago, bilateral trade in goods with Vietnam was only $451 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion. Today, it is more than $45 billion a year. Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 800 Vietnamese students studying \\r\\n\\t\\tin the United States. Today, there are nearly 19,000. And I was very \\r\\n\\t\\tproud as a senator to join in creating with my friend Tom Vallely -- who \\r\\n\\t\\tis here, who was mentioned by Ken -- and others the Fulbright School that \\r\\n\\t\\texists today in Ho Chi Minh City, the second-largest Fulbright program \\r\\n\\t\\tin the world. It was the largest for a period of time. And later this \\r\\n\\t\\tyear, we will be moving ahead with the founding of the Fulbright \\r\\n\\t\\tUniversity Vietnam, which will offer a world-class education and deepen \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ties between our peoples. And I can tell you that a huge percentage \\r\\n\\t\\tof the current governing -- the Government of Vietnam have attended the \\r\\n\\t\\tFulbright program or come over here to go to Harvard or to go to some \\r\\n\\t\\tuniversity and share an education. That is a small measure, those statistics, of a remarkable \\r\\n\\t\\ttransformation. And I can -- I\\'ll tell you a story. I can remember during the war \\r\\n\\t\\tsecuring a short pass to get to then-Saigon and coming up from the Delta \\r\\n\\t\\twhere we were stationed, and sitting on the top of the Rex Hotel in a \\r\\n\\t\\tmomentary pause from all of the craziness, and I was looking out at the \\r\\n\\t\\tcity at night watching these flares popping all around the city \\r\\n\\t\\teverywhere, and in the distance hearing bursts of gunfire and the \\r\\n\\t\\toccasional roar of a C-130 flying by, and occasionally, the burp of what \\r\\n\\t\\twe call Puff the Magic Dragon. It was surreal. An oasis of sorts, but \\r\\n\\t\\tstill the very essence of a war zone. You go back there today, which I \\r\\n\\t\\thave done, same hotel, same rooftop, but completely different view -- a \\r\\n\\t\\tcompletely different nation. The traffic circle outside the Rex is \\r\\n\\t\\tfilled with motorbikes, teeming with passengers and every form of \\r\\n\\t\\tcommerce -- from chicken coops to air conditioners to computer monitors \\r\\n\\t\\tto smartphones. Nobody\\'s thinking about the war. In fact, most people -- the majority in \\r\\n\\t\\tVietnam are too young to even remember it. It\\'s a different era. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthat calls for a wholly different relationship. No one back in 1968, I can tell you, could have possibly imagined \\r\\n\\t\\tGeneral Secretary Trong\\'s visit to Washington last year or President \\r\\n\\t\\tObama\\'s planned visit to Vietnam next month, which I look forward to \\r\\n\\t\\tjoining him in. No one could have imagined the broad bilateral agenda that we have \\r\\n\\t\\tdeveloped, including education, climate change, science, health, \\r\\n\\t\\thigh-tech, the internet, and military-to-military cooperation. And no one could have imagined the United States and Vietnam joining \\r\\n\\t\\twith 10 other nations to achieve a priceless opportunity on trade. The \\r\\n\\t\\tTrans-Pacific Partnership agreement represents nearly 40 percent of the \\r\\n\\t\\tentire world\\'s GDP, and it will create jobs, enhance the environment, \\r\\n\\t\\timprove working conditions, and strengthen commercial ties from Hanoi to \\r\\n\\t\\tTokyo to Santiago to Washington. And to be sure, let me make it clear: The true measure of our \\r\\n\\t\\tpartnership is not just whether our economies grow, but it is how they \\r\\n\\t\\tgrow. And we are working very carefully on all of those issues with \\r\\n\\t\\trespect to freedom and human rights, and by the way, within the \\r\\n\\t\\tTrans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam has accepted labor unions, the right \\r\\n\\t\\tto strike. So some of you may think we made a catastrophic mistake, but \\r\\n\\t\\tin fact their rights have been enhanced. I have to tell you all, when I -- I never thought when I was patrolling \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Mekong that nearly 50 years later, I would be involved in a plan to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp save that river. But together with our partners in the Lower Mekong \\r\\n\\t\\tInitiative, we are working to improve Vietnam\\'s resilience to the \\r\\n\\t\\teffects of climate change, which they are already feeling hugely in the \\r\\n\\t\\tentire Mekong Delta. And we are focusing our aid on clean energy and the \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment of sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem resource \\r\\n\\t\\tmanagement. We\\'re also working together in the academic arena. The Institute of \\r\\n\\t\\tInternational Education, Arizona State University, Harvard Medical \\r\\n\\t\\tSchool, and the University of Hawaii all have partnerships with \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions in Vietnam, several involving participation by the private \\r\\n\\t\\tsector. And two decades ago, when the United States and Vietnam did normalize \\r\\n\\t\\trelations, we might have been able to foresee that our countries would \\r\\n\\t\\teventually cooperate on economic matters, but something far less \\r\\n\\t\\tpredictable is now the new normal -- we are cooperating on security \\r\\n\\t\\tissues as well. Now, there is -- and particularly, I might add, with respect to the South \\r\\n\\t\\tChina Sea, but that\\'s not all -- on many other issues of security, we are \\r\\n\\t\\tengaged in discussions and in actual programs. Now, as I say all of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis, is everything where we want it to be? No. There\\'s no question that \\r\\n\\t\\tour government and the government in Hanoi obviously continue to have \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferences. But the good news is that we talk about them frankly and \\r\\n\\t\\tregularly and often productively. And for anybody who tunes in to what the original goal was with respect \\r\\n\\t\\tto our efforts in Vietnam, which were to protect the country from \\r\\n\\t\\tbecoming communist, let me make it clear to you today that while it is \\r\\n\\t\\tauthoritarian and a one-party system, it\\'s anything but communist, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause communism is an economic theory. And they are as market-oriented \\r\\n\\t\\tas any country I\\'ve ever seen, a raging capitalism -- what -- \\r\\n\\t\\tnotwithstanding within the constraints of a one-party system that still, \\r\\n\\t\\tlike the authoritarian model of China and others, tries to contain its \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation and move forward. History will determine whether or not that \\r\\n\\t\\tever works out in the long run. So it\\'s clear today that the Vietnam that we are engaged with none of us \\r\\n\\t\\tcould have imagined in the context of the discussion that is taking \\r\\n\\t\\tplace here in the context of the war. And it\\'s clear that Vietnam is \\r\\n\\t\\treaching forward towards the globalized world of modernity, and millions \\r\\n\\t\\tof people in Vietnam are already freely expressing themselves on Facebook, and many thousands of Vietnamese workers are already freely \\r\\n\\t\\tassociating to defend their interests -- even though sometimes risky. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey are the ones asking their government to guarantee in law the \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedoms that they are starting to exercise in practice. And we know \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the more progress that occurs in those areas, the more likely it is \\r\\n\\t\\tthat our bilateral relationship, which has already come an extraordinary \\r\\n\\t\\tdistance, is going to be able to ultimately reach its full potential. In 1971,when I testified against the war in Vietnam before the Senate, \\r\\n\\t\\tI spoke of the determination of veterans to undertake one last mission \\r\\n\\t\\tso that in 30 years, when our brothers went down the street without a \\r\\n\\t\\tleg or an arm and people asked why, we\\'d be able to say \"Vietnam\" and \\r\\n\\t\\tnot mean a bitter memory, but mean instead the place where America \\r\\n\\t\\tturned, and where we helped it in the turning. So it has been 45 years since that testimony, but it is clear that we \\r\\n\\t\\thave turned some very important corners. There are hard choices still to \\r\\n\\t\\tmake for our relationship to reach its full potential, but now we can \\r\\n\\t\\tsay definitively -- because so many Vietnamese and Americans themselves \\r\\n\\t\\trefuse to let our past define our future -- Vietnam, a former adversary, \\r\\n\\t\\tis now a partner with whom we have developed increasingly warm personal \\r\\n\\t\\tand national ties. That is our shared legacy, and it\\'s one that I hope \\r\\n\\t\\twe will continue to strengthen in the years to come. Thank you.   Mr. Ken Burns:Mr. Secretary, this is an extraordinary honor for me to be at \\r\\n\\t\\tthis conference and to have the opportunity to have a conversation with \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. We have -- Lynn and I and our team have lived with you for many, \\r\\n\\t\\tmany years. We came to you at the outset of the project and told you \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we wouldn\\'t interview you, but you would exist, as your colleague \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn McCain would, in the film, in the story, and you do. And it occurs \\r\\n\\t\\tto me, because your speech was so correctly addressed to the future, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we should dwell on the experience but briefly back in Vietnam. How \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes the war come back to your consciousness in those private moments? Secretary Kerry:Well, mostly in the context of the current wars. I \\r\\n\\t\\tmean, we\\'re struggling to end the war of absurdity in Syria, to end the \\r\\n\\t\\twar in Yemen -- we\\'re making progress there -- to end the struggle of \\r\\n\\t\\tLibya and get a government to stand up, end a war in Afghanistan, \\r\\n\\t\\tprevent a war in North Korea, and prevent other major challenges of \\r\\n\\t\\tfailing states or failed states. We are making great progress; we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tworking very closely with Nigeria to end the plague of Boko Haram there, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I believe we will. We are making progress in Somalia, pushing al-Shabaab \\r\\n\\t\\tback. So we\\'re really in a massive struggle against extremism in many parts of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world, and so I\\'m constantly confronting a plethora of AK-47s and \\r\\n\\t\\trockets and artillery and whatever in too many places. So in many ways \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'m still living with war as a reality, but I\\'m so pleased, obviously, \\r\\n\\t\\tto be in a place to try to be making a difference. To either end it or \\r\\n\\t\\tprevent it is a privilege, and I think the United States is doing great \\r\\n\\t\\tthings, some of which are not well understood or articulated publicly. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut we\\'re making more progress than people think. We will defeat Daesh, \\r\\n\\t\\tno question in my mind, and if certain things are able to happen with \\r\\n\\t\\tRussia and other players in the region with respect to Assad, we could \\r\\n\\t\\tdo it much sooner. So that\\'s the way it comes back, and obviously there are always \\r\\n\\t\\treminders in terms -- I mean, I don\\'t think any veteran will tell you \\r\\n\\t\\tthere aren\\'t moments where there\\'s a flash of some memory or someone \\r\\n\\t\\tthat you remember or something. I just lost one of my crew members a few \\r\\n\\t\\tweeks ago, and all my crew guys were in touch with me and back with \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, and some of them that were just very, very moved by that. But it \\r\\n\\t\\tjust really grabbed them, and I think that it stays with you. Mr. Burns:We started asking questions even before the war ended. What \\r\\n\\t\\tshould Americans have learned from the conflict in Southeast Asia, and \\r\\n\\t\\tto what extent have we in fact put those lessons into practice? Secretary Kerry:Well, I was listening to your conversation earlier, and \\r\\n\\t\\tI have to agree with you that it depends on where you sit and who you \\r\\n\\t\\tare and where you start. People are going to take different lessons out \\r\\n\\t\\tof it, and some people, unfortunately, are frozen in a place where their \\r\\n\\t\\tminds are just not going to open up to -- and I think you mentioned \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething to that degree -- they\\'re not going to be able to move beyond \\r\\n\\t\\tthe place where they retreated to and found safety. Mr. Burns:Right. Secretary Kerry:So that\\'s too bad, but there are people in that place. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut I think that clearly the lesson I articulated, number one, is don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tever confuse the war with the warriors, particularly in a volunteer \\r\\n\\t\\tstatus where people are serving their country and trying to keep all of \\r\\n\\t\\tus safe and responding to the requests of leaders who are supposed to \\r\\n\\t\\tget it right. Mr. Burns:Right. Secretary Kerry:So that\\'s number one. Number two, make sure that the \\r\\n\\t\\tflow of information is as open and free as it ought to be so everybody \\r\\n\\t\\tcan make a judgment and invest in the decision. And obviously, with \\r\\n\\t\\trespect to the Iraq War, there are questions about that because of what \\r\\n\\t\\twe learned about the absence of weapons in a time where people were \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing told they are there. So I think that that still lives with us, and \\r\\n\\t\\twe need to, obviously, insist on that. I think, thirdly, we need to -- as we define our exceptionalism, which I \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve in very deeply -- Mr. Burns:Me too. Secretary Kerry:-- but which I believe we have to manage more carefully \\r\\n\\t\\tin terms of how we talk about it and brandish it, because other people \\r\\n\\t\\tthink they\\'re exceptional too, and are. And I think that it\\'s important \\r\\n\\t\\tfor us to look at whatever country it is we\\'re looking at -- and as I \\r\\n\\t\\tmentioned a moment ago, so many assumptions, fundamental assumptions \\r\\n\\t\\twere incorrect in Vietnam, because we could only see it through one \\r\\n\\t\\tcertain lens. It was a particularly colored lens with respect to World \\r\\n\\t\\tWar II, with respect to Korea -- whatever frustrations may have grown up \\r\\n\\t\\tout of that, by the way. And I think -- never talked about enough, but \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve always thought about it -- because of the way we thought about the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunist threat and the experience of Joe McCarthy and the scare \\r\\n\\t\\ttactics that took place with respect to communism and people\\'s fear that \\r\\n\\t\\tthey never wanted to be on the wrong side of making sure we were tough \\r\\n\\t\\tenough about that. And therefore, when threats of the entire Asia domino theory were thrown \\r\\n\\t\\tat people, there was a bias towards accepting that notion rather than \\r\\n\\t\\tthinking about the history of Vietnam or the history of Ho Chi Minh or \\r\\n\\t\\tthe history of their -- Mr. Burns:Seeing it as national liberation and not a proxy war. Secretary Kerry:All of the above, and understanding the civil nature of \\r\\n\\t\\tit and so forth. So I think those three things are -- now, there are a \\r\\n\\t\\tlot more lessons, folks. You can take the Powell Doctrine, you can take \\r\\n\\t\\t-- I mean, you can run through a litany of lessons. Mr. Burns:Let me ask you something. You\\'re on the diplomatic side now, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut obviously that diplomatic side is intricately tied with the military \\r\\n\\t\\tconsiderations. And we tend to, as we made the film in Vietnam, realize \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we were hearing echoes ahead to Afghanistan, echoes ahead to Iraq, \\r\\n\\t\\tto Syria. Now, today they\\'re not mentioned, but they bubble up, that \\r\\n\\t\\twhat has been is now. But it occurs to me too that we have to look at \\r\\n\\t\\tthis from the angle of perpetual war. Eisenhower at the end of the \\x9150s \\r\\n\\t\\twarned us about the military-industrial complex, and to the extent that \\r\\n\\t\\twe can fashion lessons that are easily identifiable with a particular \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict like Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria, we also have to understand \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we\\'re also the victims of kind of momentum of warfare as a kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tperpetual state. I mean, even Dr. Kissinger was talking about this last \\r\\n\\t\\tnight. Secretary Kerry:I wish I had heard him. I wish I\\'d heard how he phrased \\r\\n\\t\\tthat. I\\'ve had -- I\\'ve talked to him a number of times, obviously, in the \\r\\n\\t\\tlast years about these challenges. What he\\'s said to me is that we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tdealing with, first of all, a very, very different world from the world \\r\\n\\t\\tthat he dealt with, and he acknowledges that right up front. And if you \\r\\n\\t\\tread his book, \"Diplomacy,\" which I\\'ve read several times -- it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tbrilliant -- he talks about balance of power, interests and state \\r\\n\\t\\tinterests, and so forth. And that was the world that really defined -- I \\r\\n\\t\\tmean, that\\'s Disraeli and Metternich and so forth. I mean, that\\'s 18th, \\r\\n\\t\\t19th centuries and so forth. The 20th century was far more defined, I think, in the bipolar way \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause of the strength we had coming out of World War I, the unfinished \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness of World War I which was World War II, and then of course we \\r\\n\\t\\twere the only economic power left standing. But we understood what we \\r\\n\\t\\twere trying to go to with the United Nations, with global pacts and \\r\\n\\t\\tagreements on human rights and on universal values and so forth, which \\r\\n\\t\\twere translated into these international institutions. And then with the \\r\\n\\t\\tfall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, forces have been \\r\\n\\t\\tunleashed together with the profound impact of technology and \\r\\n\\t\\tglobalization, which has come with technology, and so all of a sudden \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world is smaller and now you\\'ve got millions of people running \\r\\n\\t\\taround with smartphones in poor countries, poor people, but who see and \\r\\n\\t\\tknow what everybody else is doing and thinking and getting on a daily \\r\\n\\t\\tbasis. And it changes everything. And Kissinger, I think -- so I don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tagree with your -- actually, with this notion that war per -- I think \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'re in a different cycle now. We\\'re not seeing a moment -- despite what \\r\\n\\t\\tRussia is doing in Ukraine. There\\'s a reason Russia didn\\'t go to Kyiv. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd there\\'s a reason there are limits to what it is doing and will do \\r\\n\\t\\tand can do in Syria. And I think what we are seeing today is less the \\r\\n\\t\\t20th century of nation states being willing to go to war with massive \\r\\n\\t\\tkinds of casualties as a consequence of the kinds of weapons we chose to \\r\\n\\t\\tuse. Now we have non-state actors as the principal threat to every \\r\\n\\t\\tnation-state. That\\'s a different equation. And when you\\'re struggle is \\r\\n\\t\\tagainst one human being who if they decide they want to kill themselves \\r\\n\\t\\tcan go out and take 100 people or 200 people with them, or more in the \\r\\n\\t\\tcase of 9/11, et cetera, it\\'s a very asymmetrical struggle because we, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe government, have to get it right 24/7, 365, and they only have to \\r\\n\\t\\tget it right a few hours or minutes of a day. And what I think we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tseeing today. And I think the greatest challenge -- just quickly, the \\r\\n\\t\\tgreatest challenge we face, which is why I say we can\\'t be the prisoners \\r\\n\\t\\tof Vietnam. Mr. Burns:Right. Secretary Kerry:It\\'s different. And we have to see it differently. I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink the challenge today is that we\\'re not -- the world, particularly \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Western world, the developed world particularly is not doing enough \\r\\n\\t\\tto protect ourselves by investing in the long-term initiatives that will \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep people from becoming terrorists because they actually have a future \\r\\n\\t\\tand there is decent governance in their country and they can get a job \\r\\n\\t\\tultimately and share in what we translate to people as the American \\r\\n\\t\\tdream and our values. Mr. Burns:In your extraordinary effort at normalization, you had the \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity to meet with a lot of the leaders of North Vietnam and some \\r\\n\\t\\tof the people who you were fighting against in that war. How did your \\r\\n\\t\\tinteractions then in the late \\x9180s and \\x9190s with the Vietnamese modify \\r\\n\\t\\tor change, maybe even enhance your understanding of the conflict? Secretary Kerry:I don\\'t want to disappoint you. But I have \\r\\n\\t\\tto tell you truthfully, it didn\\'t really change my understanding of the \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict, which I\\'d already spent a lot of energy when I was there and \\r\\n\\t\\twhen I immediately came back trying to understand, and I talked pretty \\r\\n\\t\\tpublicly about it. What it did was inform me about our former adversary \\r\\n\\t\\tin a way that you were talking about. Mr. Burns:Yes. Secretary Kerry:It instructed me about how just unbelievably \\r\\n\\t\\tdisciplined and patient and open and ready to be sort of fair-minded and \\r\\n\\t\\tthoughtful, but nevertheless obviously hurt by the [inaudible] -- but it \\r\\n\\t\\ttaught me to see how they saw the war. To us -- it was not the Vietnam \\r\\n\\t\\tWar, it was the American war to them. And to them it was the American \\r\\n\\t\\twar that followed the French war that came before the Chinese war that \\r\\n\\t\\tfollowed the first Chinese war and that came after -- you know? We didn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tsee any of that. We never thought about sort of that longer view and \\r\\n\\t\\tlong sense of things. And obviously we completely missed the internal \\r\\n\\t\\tdynamics and struggle of North and South, the civil component of that. But it really refreshed, in a sense, my -- and it was very difficult, I \\r\\n\\t\\tmight add, because it refreshed my sense of these folks in a way that \\r\\n\\t\\tgave me confidence to come back and try to proceed with the \\r\\n\\t\\tnormalization. But it certainly wasn\\'t something that penetrated easy \\r\\n\\t\\tthe body politic of the United States. So the suspicions that still \\r\\n\\t\\texisted -- I mean, in the early 1990s, Newsweek Magazine carried a cover \\r\\n\\t\\tstory of live prisoners still being held in Vietnam. That\\'s the mood \\r\\n\\t\\tthat John McCain and I entered into as we came together to agree that we \\r\\n\\t\\twere going to try to move this process forward beginning with the \\r\\n\\t\\tPOW/MIA. And it was an extraordinary journey. I mean, we spent 10 years \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing that, trying to get enough confidence that we could put out a \\r\\n\\t\\treport which ultimately all 12 members of the POW/MIA committee signed, \\r\\n\\t\\tsplit evenly Republican and Democrat. It was quite remarkable. Mr. Burns:How did you -- I mean, this is an early diplomatic experience \\r\\n\\t\\tof you, but I mean, hindsight is so easy. How did you two, and I guess \\r\\n\\t\\tBob Kerry to some extent, even think that that was possible and how did \\r\\n\\t\\tthat -- those diplomatic efforts inform your current work as Secretary of \\r\\n\\t\\tState? Secretary Kerry:Well, the current work is informed by probably the \\r\\n\\t\\tlessons of patience and tenacity. I will tell you there were some \\r\\n\\t\\tunbelievably hairy moments where I thought the whole thing could blow \\r\\n\\t\\tup. There was one time where we were going to go into a prison outside \\r\\n\\t\\tof Saigon, then Saigon -- not then Saigon, but for a lot of people Saigon \\r\\n\\t\\t-- and we were taking a New York Times reporter with us and ABC and a \\r\\n\\t\\tcouple of other media people because the whole purpose of the trip was \\r\\n\\t\\tto prove that it was spontaneous and we could get in and people could \\r\\n\\t\\tsee that there was nothing there, or that we -- the evidence was not \\r\\n\\t\\tthere -- and we got there and some local official had not gotten the word \\r\\n\\t\\tand the place was closed. And I -- for a moment I said, okay, five years\\' \\r\\n\\t\\twork is about to blow up in smoke and this will feed all the \\r\\n\\t\\tconspiracies and so forth. But to the credit of the Vietnamese, we had \\r\\n\\t\\tthe leadership fully invested in this and I was able to get on the phone \\r\\n\\t\\tand call the foreign minister, who was able to call somebody, and a half \\r\\n\\t\\thour later we broke the walls down and we got in, and it actually turned \\r\\n\\t\\tout better because the fact that the local guy refused entrance and \\r\\n\\t\\thadn\\'t gotten the word and then on the moment we broke it open and got \\r\\n\\t\\tin there, people had total confidence of the spontaneity of it, and it \\r\\n\\t\\tactually turned out to be -- we couldn\\'t have staged it better if we\\'d \\r\\n\\t\\ttried.\\xa0 So it worked. And then another time -- a story I\\'ve not told in public, but I have -- I \\r\\n\\t\\tshould probably reserve it for memoir but I won\\'t. I\\'ll tell you a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle bit tonight.\\xa0 I had to go in to the chairperson -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tchairman of the Community Party and the president of the nation and \\r\\n\\t\\tpersuade them to allow me and another senator to go down underneath the \\r\\n\\t\\ttomb of Ho Chi Minh because there was intelligence information that \\r\\n\\t\\tthere were tunnels under there and there was a possibility that people \\r\\n\\t\\twere being held. And you can imagine what it was like to sit with the \\r\\n\\t\\tchairman of the party with a big bust of Ho above you and I\\'m telling \\r\\n\\t\\thim, \"I got to go down and check out whether there\\'s anybody underneath \\r\\n\\t\\tHo.\"\\xa0 It was pretty amazing and we did it, and I won\\'t tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou the rest of the story about what it was like or what happened. Mr. Burns:We anxiously await those memoirs. Secretary Kerry:It was amazing. That\\'s what I want. You have to \\r\\n\\t\\tactually anxiously wait. Mr. Burns:The -- this idea maybe not of perpetual war but of the lessons \\r\\n\\t\\tlearned from Vietnam or perhaps missed in various conflicts that we\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\thad since, the Iran deal stands, as Mr. Barnes said so eloquently, \"in \\r\\n\\t\\tstark contrast to that,\" and it seems that you and the President have \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen able to arrest a momentum or a default practice of war. I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\timpressed by that. Can you talk about that? That was an extraordinary \\r\\n\\t\\tachievement. I mean, many Americans disagree, but I think the notion \\r\\n\\t\\tthat in an age when the response to everything is let\\'s go in there and \\r\\n\\t\\tput the boots on the ground -- Secretary Kerry:Sure. Mr. Burns:-- this was the opposite of that, and you placed faith in a \\r\\n\\t\\ttenuous at best outcome that seems to have been at least so far -- knock \\r\\n\\t\\ton wood -- good for everybody. Secretary Kerry:Well, look, I believe \\r\\n\\t\\t-- President Obama and I have \\r\\n\\t\\ttalked about this frequently a number of times. I learned through the \\r\\n\\t\\twar and have said many times that one of the principal obligations of \\r\\n\\t\\tanybody in the highest positions of responsibility and certainly the \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidency is if you are going to make -- if you are going to ask young \\r\\n\\t\\tmen and women to go and put their lives on the line and if not die \\r\\n\\t\\tsuffer perhaps grievous injury and live with whatever kind of injury for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe rest of their lives, you better make damn sure you have tried \\r\\n\\t\\teverything possible that is legitimate to first exercise diplomacy and \\r\\n\\t\\tmake war the last resort. That is critical. And those of us who were privileged to come back from Vietnam -- whole, \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly -- and my guys on my crew, we still kick it around, we get \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether, and we have a saying: every day is extra. And it\\'s true, every \\r\\n\\t\\tday is extra. And it gives you the opportunity, particularly since I am \\r\\n\\t\\tnow in a position of responsibility, to live those -- to live my beliefs \\r\\n\\t\\tand to live my lessons. And I think that the President, I know, shares \\r\\n\\t\\tthat belief. He was deeply impacted by the funerals and the letters he \\r\\n\\t\\thad to write and what you have to go through in terms of Afghanistan, \\r\\n\\t\\tIraq, and so forth, and other efforts. So you\\'d think this was common sense, but it\\'s not the automatic \\r\\n\\t\\tinstinct of everybody, obviously. Mr. Burns:And how did this -- I mean, this President was a little boy \\r\\n\\t\\tduring Vietnam. How did he get -- Secretary Kerry:Well, he\\'s a smart man, and he learned a lot. Mr. Burns:I think he understood the lesson of Vietnam. Secretary Kerry:He did. I think he understood the lesson of Vietnam, \\r\\n\\t\\tand more. And I think the President -- I mean, has struck me by how \\r\\n\\t\\tthoughtful he is in the questions that he asks and the way that he \\r\\n\\t\\tprobes with respect to the options that are put in front of him. And my \\r\\n\\t\\tsense is that we also are living in a different -- in a different world, \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent set of choices. Let me be more precise. There are places where we have no choice. I am \\r\\n\\t\\tnot a pacifist. Mr. Burns:No? Secretary Kerry:Even after the experience of war. And I\\'ve read a lot \\r\\n\\t\\tabout war -- I read a lot about World War I, a lot about World War II \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly. I know you have Joe Galloway here. One of the battles I \\r\\n\\t\\tmost admire and one of the greatest examples of American guts and \\r\\n\\t\\tprowess was the Battle of Ia Drang Valley. And there were many examples \\r\\n\\t\\tof that, and I think every Vietnam vet sometimes probably bristles a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle bit about the greatest generation references, because I think \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople feel like they fought just as passionately, just as valiantly, \\r\\n\\t\\tand gave as much of themselves. But the outcome, obviously, was \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent, the structure was different, and that\\'s part of the tension \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we live with. That\\'s part of what you were talking about a little \\r\\n\\t\\twhile ago. It wasn\\'t -- it didn\\'t invite a great victory parade. There \\r\\n\\t\\twasn\\'t some denouement where you dropped a bomb and -- I was just in \\r\\n\\t\\tHiroshima, and you can end a war where the war in Europe had already \\r\\n\\t\\tended and Hitler was dead. It wasn\\'t that. And so that\\'s not very \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfying for anybody, particularly the people who fight in it. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s one of the reasons there\\'s a lingering anger by some people who \\r\\n\\t\\thaven\\'t necessarily worked through, as you talked about, and won\\'t, \\r\\n\\t\\tperhaps -- particularly those who will not see film -- that has an impact. But I think that we\\'re living in a period now where we have to call on \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople, unfortunately, to go into harm\\'s way, particularly against Daesh \\r\\n\\t\\tand some other people who threaten us and with whom there is nothing to \\r\\n\\t\\tnegotiate. I mean, where do you begin? There is no negotiation. And \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly when they threaten and tell you that unless you are going \\r\\n\\t\\tto be them and be like them and convert and do a whole bunch of things \\r\\n\\t\\t-- Mr. Burns:They\\'ll kill you. Secretary Kerry:-- you\\'re the infidel, and doomed to be displaced. Mr. Burns:You spoke in your remarks about one of the big lessons having \\r\\n\\t\\tto do with not blaming the warrior. I think that is a lesson that we\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tlearned, all of us, regardless of our political -- Secretary Kerry:Well, we have and we haven\\'t, Ken. Mr. Burns:But I want to ask you whether the fact that we now have an \\r\\n\\t\\tall-volunteer army that suffers, as Lynn and Mark [ph] and I were \\r\\n\\t\\ttalking, its loss is apart and alone from everyone, separates us and \\r\\n\\t\\tpermits us both the luxury of that respect, but also the distance that \\r\\n\\t\\tthat permits as well. And I think to some extent we hide behind a kind \\r\\n\\t\\tof false patriotism about that -- many Americans do. Secretary Kerry:Well, I\\'m not going to judge whether it\\'s false \\r\\n\\t\\tpatriotism or not; I don\\'t know. But I think there is a separation. And \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s a dangerous separation. And there is the kind of permissiveness \\r\\n\\t\\twhich has been talked about. It\\'s -- and that is dangerous, I agree. Mr. Burns:Yes. Secretary Kerry:I have always had \\r\\n\\t\\t-- I mean, I\\'m not -- now I\\'m ranging a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle bit into the issues that I don\\'t touch on much very much in my \\r\\n\\t\\tcurrent role -- and try not to, I might add -- but in the spirit of this \\r\\n\\t\\tevening, I will -- I would just say that I have deep reservations about \\r\\n\\t\\tjust an all-volunteer military. And I think that there should be shared \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibility among all Americans and all responsibility.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd I think that\\'s one of the best ways that you don\\'t have wars, that \\r\\n\\t\\tif you\\'re spreading that -- one of the great difficulties we had in \\r\\n\\t\\tVietnam was the way the draft was applied. And that created enormous \\r\\n\\t\\tresentment and anger. It\\'s one of the things that probably still lingers \\r\\n\\t\\tas a tension in relationships. But I think every American ought to find \\r\\n\\t\\ta way to serve somehow. It doesn\\'t have to be in the military; there are \\r\\n\\t\\tplenty of other things to do. But I rather like still the idea that \\r\\n\\t\\teverybody ought to give back something. Mr. Burns:I think I\\'d agree. The war in Vietnam had an immense impact on \\r\\n\\t\\ta whole generation of us, of Americans, and of course, also a whole \\r\\n\\t\\tgeneration of Vietnamese and Cambodians and Laotians. When you look back \\r\\n\\t\\tat what\\'s happened in Afghanistan and Iraq and now Syria for the past 5, \\r\\n\\t\\t10, 15 years, what are your thoughts about the potential long-term \\r\\n\\t\\timpacts there for those people, for those societies? And to what extent \\r\\n\\t\\tdo those thoughts influence your views concerning the importance of \\r\\n\\t\\tdiplomacy and choices you\\'re making every day in the Middle East, which \\r\\n\\t\\tseems still -- still -- the center of all of our concern? Secretary Kerry:It affects it profoundly. I mean, it\\'s a big deal in \\r\\n\\t\\tthose countries. And I\\'ll come back to that in a minute, because I just \\r\\n\\t\\tthought of something that I wanted to share with people, because it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\timportant to take away from here. You mentioned a moment ago you thought \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we had learned a lesson, and I said for the most part. Mr. Burns:Yeah. Secretary Kerry:And I want to share with people why I say \\r\\n\\t\\t\"for the most \\r\\n\\t\\tpart.\" We do welcome people home. We do say thank you. And we have lots \\r\\n\\t\\tof ways in which we have built into our daily lives a recognition for \\r\\n\\t\\tservice -- Hire the Veteran programs, outreach programs, service people \\r\\n\\t\\twho can get a first-class seat on a plane if it\\'s open, different things \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we say thank you, and that\\'s superb, wonderful, and totally well \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserved. But there are more meaningful things to veterans coming home from war. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd we still have too long a backlog. We\\'ve had 188 -- we\\'ve had a \\r\\n\\t\\treduction of about 180-plus days in the wait time for people to be able \\r\\n\\t\\tto get into the VA and get an appointment. But that\\'s still -- that\\'s 188 \\r\\n\\t\\tdays taken away from 282 days that it took to get there. That\\'s still \\r\\n\\t\\ttoo long -- 90 days, whatever it is that it works out -- it\\'s somewhere in \\r\\n\\t\\tthat vicinity. It\\'s just wrong. It\\'s not right. I mean, let\\'s get down \\r\\n\\t\\tto four days, a week, and in some cases, that\\'s the difference between \\r\\n\\t\\tlife and death. Mr. Burns:Right. Secretary Kerry:And -- I think -- so for mental health \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly we need greater intervention and activity. There are other \\r\\n\\t\\tthings that matter; families need more help. There are a lot of families \\r\\n\\t\\tfor whom this is extraordinarily disruptive. Mr. Burns:Yes, of course. Secretary Kerry:And women. Women particularly have a different set of \\r\\n\\t\\thealth problems, and sometimes abuse problems that they have to respond \\r\\n\\t\\tto, so that\\'s also been complicated. So there are things that we need to do even more effectively. And I \\r\\n\\t\\tmight add one of the dangers of what we have today in the, quote -- in \\r\\n\\t\\tthis volunteer structure, is I\\'ve met people who are on their fifth and \\r\\n\\t\\tsixth deployments to a Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere. And that\\'s -- \\r\\n\\t\\tboy is that tough. I mean, that is just really hard for people to hold a \\r\\n\\t\\tfamily together, raise kids, and do the things we expect. So we got to \\r\\n\\t\\tconfront this as a country. That\\'s part of what I say about sharing it \\r\\n\\t\\tmore and being willing to do what we need to do. I\\'ll probably get in trouble for this, but years ago I proposed -- and I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink there are others who\\'ve talked about it -- that vets who want to go \\r\\n\\t\\tto the Veterans Administration go to the Veterans Administration. They \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserve the hospital they want and deserve the choice. But those who \\r\\n\\t\\tcan\\'t get in or it\\'s too late, who need to go somewhere, ought to be \\r\\n\\t\\table to go somewhere else, and we ought to be able to take care of them. Mr. Burns:So I would withdraw my false patriotism comment and say more \\r\\n\\t\\tthat, as I think you\\'ve done so articulately, Mr. Secretary, that we \\r\\n\\t\\thave paid a kind of common and easy respect to the veteran, but the \\r\\n\\t\\tharder work of having the resources necessary to reduce that wait time \\r\\n\\t\\t-- Secretary Kerry:Sure. Mr. Burns:-- and all the other things -- Secretary Kerry:Are tough. Mr. Burns:-- you just described is the work that still has to be done. Secretary Kerry:Now, let me come to your other \\r\\n\\t\\t-- to your question, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause it\\'s an important question. In every country, you can go to -- \\r\\n\\t\\tyou go to the Czech Republic and they\\'re still worried about a war that \\r\\n\\t\\thappened in 1600-and-something, and you can go to -- obviously, you go \\r\\n\\t\\tanywhere in the Middle East and you can learn, which I know all the \\r\\n\\t\\tdetails of to a fare-thee-well aboutKarbala in 682andwhat happened to Hussainand the fight for legitimacy betweenTwelversandSevenersand \\r\\n\\t\\tso -- it\\'s extraordinary, which is why I gave a speech last night in \\r\\n\\t\\tHouston about the importance of religion in the context to understanding \\r\\n\\t\\tit and reaching out and working with various religious entities and \\r\\n\\t\\tgroups as you try to do good foreign policy, because you can\\'t do it \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday in today\\'s world. Four out of five people on the planet are \\r\\n\\t\\taffiliated with one religion or another, and many of them are able to \\r\\n\\t\\ttake it to some very risky, dangerous places. And if you think back \\r\\n\\t\\thistorically on the Thirty Years\\' War, and other things, we shouldn\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tclaim any primacy in our ability to avoid that kind of memory -- Northern \\r\\n\\t\\tIreland and other places. So my point is we got to think very carefully about the impression that \\r\\n\\t\\twe are leaving and what we are doing in various places because this can \\r\\n\\t\\tbecome the long-term -- I mean, look at the Crusades and look at their \\r\\n\\t\\timpact on people\\'s attitude about some of the things that we choose to \\r\\n\\t\\tdo or not do today in the Middle East. It still comes up. So we have to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe, I think, particularly sensitive to the aftermath and to what the \\r\\n\\t\\tlong-term vision is for how we are going to manage to transition people \\r\\n\\t\\twhere we want them to go in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and elsewhere. And trust me, it is complicated beyond what I had even imagined in the \\r\\n\\t\\tbeginning, many people -- we\\'ve got about six wars going on in Syria. \\r\\n\\t\\tNow, most of you would probably not have thought that. But you\\'ve got \\r\\n\\t\\tKurds versus Turkey. You\\'ve got Saudi Arabia versus Iran. You\\'ve got \\r\\n\\t\\tSunni versus Shia. You got a whole bunch of people versus Daesh/ISIL. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd then you got a whole bunch of people against Assad. And that\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore you get into some tribal and other things that go back to Karbala \\r\\n\\t\\tor before. So this is -- it\\'s -- they\\'re -- and then you have an enormous Muslim \\r\\n\\t\\tBrotherhood challenge with respect to -- Mr. Burns:Egypt. Secretary Kerry:-- Egypt and its attitude about Qatar and Turkey and \\r\\n\\t\\tSaudi versus other Arab countries in the region who have a slightly \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent -- so you put all those in a caldron and bubble it up, it\\'s not \\r\\n\\t\\teasy to find the way to go forward. And that\\'s why I think we have to \\r\\n\\t\\tthink very -- that\\'s the lens I\\'m talking about. That is a lesson from \\r\\n\\t\\tVietnam, is we cannot look at other countries and see them only through \\r\\n\\t\\tan American lens. We have to try and put ourselves wherever we are into \\r\\n\\t\\tthe other person\\'s shoes, into the other person\\'s life, and see their \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry as they see their country, and we\\'ll do a lot better. Mr. Burns:I just had the opportunity to spend some time discussing with \\r\\n\\t\\ta mentor -- somebody you know, Tom Brokaw -- a thorny problem that I had \\r\\n\\t\\tin an unrelated subject. And he said to me, \"What we learn is more \\r\\n\\t\\timportant than what we set out to do.\" And I think, Mr. Secretary, \\r\\n\\t\\tthere\\'s not a person here in this room who doesn\\'t appreciate that you \\r\\n\\t\\twould spend one of your extra days with us. Thank you very much. Secretary Kerry:Thank you.\\xa0 My pleasure, honestly.',\n",
       " 'Nothing that I say to you can bring comfort. Nothing\\r\\nthat anyone else can say can bring comfort. But there is a voice that speaks without\\r\\nwords and addresses us in the depths of our being. And that voice says to our troubled\\r\\nsouls: I would be misleading you if I said I understand\\r\\nthis. I don\\'t. Why human beings do evil, I do not understand. Why bad things happen to\\r\\ngood people, I do not understand. Like every one of you, at such a time as this, I go on my\\r\\nknees and ask, \"Why, Oh Lord, Why?\" I do know this: At such a time we need each other. To the families of all those who died here, I say: You are not alone. \\r\\nThe heart of America aches with\\r\\nyours. We hold your agony in the center of our prayers. The entire nation is a community\\r\\nof shock, of love, and of grief. May you feel the embrace of the literally hundreds of millions who\\r\\nweep with you. And our thoughts are with the many who bore injury;\\r\\nwe hope and pray along with their families that they will be whole again. One of \\r\\nthe truths of the human condition is that suffering binds\\r\\nus together. Suffering lays bare our common human need for love, kindness, and grace. In\\r\\nour suffering all of us stand naked before God. And for all of us, the Scripture says, though\\r\\nit may be darkness now, \"joy cometh in the morning.\" Here, in Jefferson County,\\r\\nthe spring has yielded to a cold winter of the heart. But I am reminded of the words of a sage writer who\\r\\nsaid: \"In the depths of winter, I finally learned\\r\\nthat within me there lay an invincible summer.\" To the world that is watching us, let us remind them\\r\\nthat the young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for the spirit of America.\\r\\nAmerica is a good and decent place; and our goodness is a light to all the nations of\\r\\nthe world. We have seen in this community so much of that goodness, so much healing, so\\r\\nmuch of what is best in our country. You have shown us that even in this ashen moment,\\r\\nthere is a spark that lights our way forward. At Columbine High School last week, this\\r\\ngreat goodness was expressed in the bravery of the teachers who risked their own lives to\\r\\nprotect the lives of their students. These teachers knew their pupils, and loved them as\\r\\nif they were their own children. No one can doubt that. Their love was made not \\r\\nof words; there love was made of acts. We remember among them coach and teacherDave Sanders, who\\r\\nbravely led so many to safety -- but never made it out of the building himself. The young,\\r\\ntoo, were brave. The student [Aaron Hancey] with first aid training who swallowed his fear and \\r\\nwent back into that awful, smoke-filled, terror-filled corridor to lead others in a three-hour crusade to try to save\\r\\nhis teacher\\'s life. There were countless acts of heroism that saved many lives. And there\\r\\nwas profound heroism among those who died. Among them -- Among them, we rememberCassie Bernall, whose final words, \\r\\nas she stared death in the face, were:\\r\\n\"Yes, I do believe in God.\" Those who \"suffer [persecution] for righteousness\\' sake\" \\r\\n-- \"theirs is the kingdom of [Heaven].\" Now, as we are brought to our knees in the shock of\\r\\nthis moment, what say we? What say we into the open muzzle of this tragedy cocked and\\r\\naimed at our hearts? If our spiritual courage can match the eternal moment, we can\\r\\nmake manifest in our lives the truth of the prophesy: \"that the sufferings of this\\r\\npresent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory [which] shall be revealed in\\r\\nus.\" More than ever I realize that every one of us is\\r\\nresponsible for all the children. There are children today hungering for\\r\\ntheir parents to become more involved in their schools, and to fill the spiritual void in\\r\\ntheir lives. If you are a parent, your children need attention. If you are a grandparent, they need your time. If you do not have children,\\r\\nthere are kids who need your example and your presence. Somewhere -- Somewhere in \\r\\nthe reach of\\r\\nevery adult in this country is a child to hold and teach -- a child to save. We must have the courage not to look away \\r\\n-- in life or in death -- from those\\r\\nwho feel despised and rejected, those for whom we are taught: \"sin lieth crouching at the\\r\\ndoor.\" All adults in this nation must take on the challenge\\r\\nof creating in all of God\\'s children \"a clean heart,\" \"and \\r\\n[renew] a right spirit within.\" I believe the best antidote to vulgarity and\\r\\nbrutality is the power of a better example, of love over indifference. In the words of\\r\\nHenry Drummond, \"the [expulsive] power of a higher affection.\" Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the\\r\\nkind:Quickly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned. Parents, we can stop the violence and the hate. In a\\r\\nculture rife with violence -- where too many young people place too little value on a\\r\\nhuman life -- we can rise up and we can say \"No more!\" We have seen enough of violence in our schools.\\r\\nWe must replace a culture of violence and mayhem with one of values and meaning. It is too\\r\\neasy for a young child to get a gun; and everywhere we look, there are too many lessons\\r\\nin how to use one. We can do something about that. We need more discipline and character in our\\r\\nschools, and more alternatives to drugs and crimes. We can do something about that. We need\\r\\nto recognize the earliest signs of trouble, and teach our children to resolve their\\r\\ndifferences with reason and conscience. We can do something\\r\\nabout that. No society will ever be perfect. But we know the way\\r\\nthings should be. And America can be what we are meant to be: a community of goodness, of\\r\\nreason, of moral strength. As the Psalmist prayed, I also prayed: \"So teach us to\\r\\nnumber our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.\" If we can work our way as a people to that\\r\\nplace -- where caring and compassion open us to the lives of all our children -- then those children who died here will not have died in\\r\\nvain. And then, in the words of the \\r\\nProphet [Isaiah]: N And never again shall they \"hurt or destroy in all\"\\r\\nGod\\'s \"holy mountain.\"16 For now, I know only that my heart weeps with you,\\r\\nand with you I yearn that we may come through this dark passage a stronger and more caring\\r\\npeople. For I believe, with all my heart, that \"Earth\\r\\nhas no sorrows that Heaven cannot heal.\"',\n",
       " 'Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, it is absolutely a pleasure to see all of you here today and I\\x92ve been getting reports about the conference, and I am so excited to join you today to talk about what we are focused on here at this Summit on Women and the Economy. Before I begin, I want to apologize for the delay but there were so many people who showed up, and because this is the largest gathering of distinguished foreign diplomats in San Francisco, since the founding of the United Nations -- there was a little more of a delay in getting everyone in, and there are still people outside we hope will be able to get in. Before I begin my remarks, let me recognize a few of our special guests here. We have two members of Congress, Zoe Lofgren and Jackie Speier. Thank you very much for being with us. And we have two distinguished mayors. I want to welcome Mayor Edwin Lee and his wife Anita from right here in San Francisco. Mayor Lee? And Mayor Jean Quan from Oakland. Thank you for being here. And on a personal note I want to acknowledge a wonderful and former chief of protocol, Charlotte Shultz. Thank you, Charlotte. Now as this summit comes to a close, we will adopt a declaration for the first time in APEC\\x92s history that will affirm this organization\\x92s and each member economy\\x92s commitment to improving women\\x92s access to capital and markets, to building women\\x92s capacities and skills, and to supporting the rise of women leaders in both the public and private sectors. And it is fitting that this declaration would be adopted here in San Francisco because it was just one mile from here, in the Herbst Theater, where the United Nations Charter was signed 66 years ago. In fact, the APEC Summit, which brings you all here is a celebration of that important occasion and a recognition that history is made right here in San Francisco. Because San Francisco is an appropriate venue for this economic discussion. Because this is a community that is renowned for its spirit of inclusion and opportunity for all. So on behalf of the United States and our people I give each of you, and you nations, my heartiest welcome and my heartfelt thanks for being here and undertaking this great mission with us. Now there will be a temptation on the part of those observing or covering this summit, perhaps on the part of those of us attending it as well, to say that our purpose is chiefly to advance the rights of women, to achieve justice and equality on women\\x92s behalf. And that is, of course, a noble cause to be sure and one that is very close to my heart. But at the risk of being somewhat provocative at the outset, I believe our goal is even bolder, one that extends beyond women to all humankind. The big challenge we face in these early years of 21st century is how to grow our economies and ensure shared prosperity for all nations and all people. We want to give every one of our citizens, men and women alike, young and old alike, greater opportunity to find work, to save and spend money, to pursue happiness ultimately to live up to their own God-given potentials. That is a clear and simple vision to state. But to make it real, to achieve the economic expansion we all seek, we need to unlock a vital source of growth that can power our economies in the decades to come. And that vital source of growth is women. With economic models straining in every corner of the world, none of us can afford to perpetuate the barriers facing women in the workforce. Because by increasing women\\x92s participation in the economy and enhancing their efficiency and productivity, we can bring about a dramatic impact on the competitiveness and growth of our economies. Because when everyone has a chance to participate in the economic life of a nation, we can all be richer. More of us can contribute to the global GDP. And the gap between the developed and the developing countries would narrow significantly as productivity rises in economies from Haiti to Papua New Guinea. But that great, global dream cannot be realized by tinkering around the edges of reform. Nor, candidly, can it be secured though any singular commitment on the part of us here. It requires, rather, a fundamental transformation, a paradigm shift in how governments make and enforce laws and policies, how businesses invest and operate, how people make choices in the marketplace. The transformational nature of this undertaking that lies ahead is, in my view, not unlike other momentous shifts in the economic history of our world. In the 19th century, many nations began moving from an agricultural to an industrial economy. Then the inventions and mass productions of that era gave rise in the 20th century to the information age and the knowledge economy, with an unprecedented rise in innovation and prosperity. As information transcends borders and creates opportunities for farmers to bank on mobile phones and children in distant villages to learn remotely, I believe that here, at the beginning of the 21st century, we are entering the participation age, where every individual, regardless of gender or other characteristics, is poised to be a contributing and valued member of the global marketplace. In some APEC economies, this transformation has been underway for quite awhile now. In others, it has begun more recently. But in all, progress has been too slow and too uneven. But there is no doubt that the increasing numbers of women in the economy and the rising productivity gains from improving the distribution of their talents and skills has helped fuel significant growth everywhere. And economies that are making the shift more effectively and rapidly are dramatically outperforming those that have not. So if we are serious about this undertaking, if we really want to achieve parity for women in the workforce, both that they participate and how they participate, then we must remove structural and social impediments that stack the deck against them. Now, I don\\x92t urge this because it is the right thing to do, though I believe that it is, but for the sake of our children and our nations, it is necessary to do. Because a rising tide of women in an economy raises the fortunes of families and nations. Now, my husband often says, in making the argument that everyone should be involved, that we don\\x92t have a person to waste. I think that\\x92s true. When it comes to the enormous challenge of our time, to systematically and relentlessly pursue more economic opportunity in all of our lands, we don\\x92t have a person to waste, and we certainly don\\x92t have a gender to waste either. So let\\x92s look at the evidence. The case for unlocking the potential of women and including them more fully in the economic life of our nations begins with the accounting of how women already are driving growth. The 21 economies of APEC are among the most dynamic in the world. Together, we represent more than half of total economic global output, and more than 60 percent of women in the APEC economies are part of our formal workforces. They\\x92re opening stores, they\\x92re running businesses, they\\x92re harvesting crops, they\\x92re assembling electronics, and designing software. The Economist points out that the increase in employment of women in developed countries during the past decade has added more to global growth than China has, and that\\x92s a lot. And in the United States, a McKinsey study found that women went from holding 37 percent of all jobs to nearly 48 percent over the past 40 years, and that in sheer value terms, these women have punched well above their weight. The productivity gains attributable to this modest increase in women\\x92s overall share of the labor market accounts for approximately one-quarter of the current U.S. GDP. That works out to more than three and a half trillion dollars, more than the GDP of Germany and more than half the GDPs of both China and Japan. So the promise is clear. What then is the problem? If women are already making such contributions to economic growth, why do we need a major realignment in our thinking, our markets, and our policies? Why do we need to issue a declaration from this summit? Well, because evidence of progress is not evidence of success, and to be sure, the rate of progress for women in the economies of our region varies widely. Laws, customs, and the values that fuel them provide roadblocks to full inclusion. In the United States and in every economy in APEC, millions of women are still sidelined, unable to find a meaningful place for themselves in the formal workforce. And some of those who get to enter the workforce are really confined by very clear signals to a lower rung on the job ladder, and there\\x92s a web of legal and social restrictions that limit their potential. Or they are confronted with a glass ceiling that keeps them from the most senior positions. Only 11 of the CEOs of the Fortune Global 500 companies are women. That\\x92s less than 3 percent. Some women in the APEC region don\\x92t have the same inheritance rights as men. So they can\\x92t inherit property or businesses owned by their fathers. Some don\\x92t have the power to confer citizenship on their children, so their families have less access to housing and education, and they must constantly renew residency permits making it harder for them to work. Some are even subject to different taxes than men. Too often they are denied access to credit and may even be prohibited from opening bank accounts, signing contracts, purchasing property, incorporating a business, or filing lawsuits without a male guardian. Some women earn almost as much as men before they have children but less afterwards and even less if they are single mothers. These barriers and restrictions, some formal, some informal, erode women\\x92s abilities to participate fully in their economies and to support their families whether as employees or entrepreneurs. Now, these barriers are certainly not unique to this region, the Asia Pacific region. Variations of them can be found everywhere in the world. But because this is the most dynamic economic region in the world, what we do will have an impact on everywhere else. Some barriers are left over from a different time and haven\\x92t changed to reflect new economic realities or concepts of justice. Some seek to preserve an economic order that ensures that men have the higher paying jobs to support their families. And some reflect lingering cultural norms, the belief that women need to be protected from work that is thought to be dangerous or unhealthy for them. In truth, what is dangerous is denying ourselves the level of economic growth we need to build stronger societies. And what is unhealthy is for women to be denied the chance to contribute fully to that growth, because that denies everyone, first and foremost their families, a chance at greater prosperity. Now, economic orders do not perpetuate themselves. They are made and remade through countless decisions, small and large, by economic policymakers, political leaders, and business executives. So if we want to see opportunities for women improve, we must begin with sound economic policies that explicitly address the unique challenges that limit women. And here\\x92s why: A Goldman Sachs report shows how a reduction in barriers to female labor force participation would increase America\\x92s GDP by 9 percent. We admit we still have such barriers. It would increase the Eurozone\\x92s by 13 percent \\x96 and they need it \\x96 and Japan\\x92s by 16 percent. Unlocking the potential of women by narrowing the gender gap could lead to a 14 percent rise in per capita incomes by the year 2020 in several APEC economies, including China, Russia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Korea. Of course, rising income means increased spending, which in itself helps to fuel more growth. And here, too, women make a strong contribution. A Boston Consulting Group survey concludes that, globally, women will control $15 trillion in spending by the year 2014. And by 2028, BCG says women will be responsible for about two-thirds of consumer spending worldwide. Digging a little deeper into the data, we can see positive benefits that flow from both the quality of spending and the quantity of saving by women because multiple studies have shown that women spend more of their earned income on food, healthcare, home improvement, and schooling for themselves and their children. In short, they reinvest, and that kind of spending has a multiplier effect leading to more job growth and diversified local economies. And that, in turn, can help ensure better educated, healthier citizens as well as provide a cushion in the event of market downturns. The research also shows that women are stronger savers than men. Data \\x96 does that surprise any of the women in the audience? Data from 20 semi-industrialized countries suggest that for every one percentage point increase in the share of household income generated by women, aggregate domestic savings increased by roughly 15 basis points. And a higher savings rate translates into a higher tax base as well. Integrating women more effectively into the way businesses invest, market, and recruit also yields benefits in terms of profitability and corporate governance. In a McKinsey survey, a third of executives reported increased profits as a result of investments in empowering women in emerging markets. Research also demonstrates a strong correlation between higher degrees of gender diversity in the leadership ranks of business and organizational performance. The World Bank finds that by eliminating discrimination against female workers and managers, managers could significantly increase productivity per worker by 25 to 40 percent. Reducing barriers preventing women from working in certain sectors would lower the productivity gap between male and female workers by a third to one half across a range of countries. Now, these gains are achieved because removing barriers means that the talent and skills of women can be deployed more efficiently. And in our globalized world today, this is a competitive edge that is more important than ever. All of this underscores my primary point: When we liberate the economic potential of women, we elevate the economic performance of communities, nations, and the world. Take just one sector of our economy -- agriculture -- to illustrate what I mean. We know women play an important role in driving agriculture-led growth worldwide. Agriculture is a powerful engine for development, as we have seen in the remarkable rise of China and India. And in several APEC economies, women comprise nearly half of the agriculture labor force. They sustain every link in the agricultural chain: They plant the seeds; they care for the livestock; they harvest the crops; they sell them at markets; they store the food, and then they prepare it for consumption. But as for the role of women in agriculture nowadays, despite their presence in all of these kinds of jobs, they have less to show for all of their work. Women farmers are up to 30 percent less productive than male farmers, and that\\x92s not because they are working less or are less committed. It\\x92s because women farmers have access to fewer resources. They have less fertilizer, fewer tools, poorer quality seeds, and less access to training or to land. And they have much less time to farm because they also have to do most of the household work. When that resource gap is closed and resources are allocated equally -- and better yet, efficiently -- women and men are equally productive in agriculture. And that has positive benefits. In Nepal, for example, where mothers have greater ownership of land because of their inheritance rights, there are fewer severely underweight children. So what we have here is an opportunity to accelerate growth in developing economies while, at the same time, producing more and cheaper food for our planet. Close the resource gap holding women back in developing economies, and we could feed 150 million more people worldwide every year, and that\\x92s according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, and that\\x92s in addition to the higher incomes for families and the more efficient markets and the more agricultural trade that would result. The same kind of impact can be seen in other sectors in our economies, because we know that the entrepreneurial spirit of women is strong. More than half a million enterprises in Indonesia and nearly 400,000 in Korea are headed by women. They run fully 20 percent of all of China\\x92s small businesses. All across Asia, women have and continue to dominate light manufacturing sectors that have proved crucial to the region\\x92s economic takeoff. And economists predict that women-owned businesses, which now provide for 16 percent of all U.S. jobs, will create nearly a third of the new jobs anticipated over the next seven years. So with that kind of evidence at hand, it is little wonder that the World Economic Forum\\x92s Gender Gap Report finds a direct correlation between the gender gap and economic productivity -- the lower the former, the higher the latter. As Klaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum concludes, \\x93Women and girls must be treated equally if a country is to grow and prosper.\\x94 The declaration we will adopt here today can begin to close that gender gap, by making it possible for more women to unleash their potential as workers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. And the goals in this declaration are very specific. We commit to giving women access to capital so women entrepreneurs can turn their ideas into the small and medium enterprises that are the source of so much growth and job creation. We urge examining and reforming our legal and regulatory systems so women can avail themselves of the full range of financial services. And such reforms can also help ensure that women are not forced to compromise on the well-being of their children to pursue a business career. We must improve women\\x92s access to markets so those who start businesses can keep them open. For example, we need to correct the problem of what\\x92s called information asymmetric problems, meaning that woman are not informed about the trade and technical assistance programs that are available, as we just discussed in agriculture. There are two State Department programs that we are using to try to model a lot of these approaches. A program called Pathways to Prosperity connects policymakers and private sector leaders in 15 countries across the Americas. It\\x92s aimed at helping small business owners, small farmers, craftspeople do more business, both locally and through regional trade. And the African Women\\x92s Entrepreneurship Program reaches out to women that are part of the African Growth and Opportunity Act countries to provide them with information and tools to take advantage of what AGOA has to offer. And then finally, we must support the rise of women leaders in the public and private sectors because they bring firsthand knowledge and understanding of these challenges, and their perspectives will add great value as we shape policies and programs that will eliminate barriers to bring women into all economic sectors. Several businesses already are taking significant steps to meet such goals. Goldman Sachs is training the next generation of women business leaders in developing economies with its Ten Thousand Women campaign. Coca Cola\\x92s \\x93Five by Twenty\\x94 campaign aims to support five million women entrepreneurs worldwide by 2020. And just this week, Wal-Mart announced that it will use its purchasing power to support women entrepreneurs by doubling the amount of goods it will buy from women-owned businesses globally to $20 billion by 2016.  In addition, Wal-Mart will invest $100 million to help women develop their job skills, including women who work on the farms and factories overseas that are Wal-Mart suppliers. Now, these programs are just the start of the type of permanent shift we need to see in how businesses worldwide invest in women. Now, I do not underestimate the difficulty of ushering in what I call the participation age. Legal changes require political will. Cultural and behavioral changes require social will. All of this requires leadership by governments, civil society, and by the private sector. And even when countries pursue aggressive structural reforms to get more women into their economy and enhance their productivity, they don\\x92t always produce the results that we would like to see. So we have to stay with this. Persistence is part of our long-term plan. And while economic orders may be hard to change, and policy strategies -- no matter how good -- can only get us so far, we all have to make a choice, not simply to remove the barriers but to really fill this field with active investment and involvement from all of us. Those of you who are here today are leaders from across the APEC region, and it is your choice to come here, it is your choice to focus on women and the economy that will send a message rippling across APEC. And the countless decisions that will be taken by leaders and citizens to encourage young girls to stay in school, to acquire skills, to talk to that banker, to understand what it means to give a loan to a woman who will work her heart out to produce a result for herself and her children. And when we do that, we are going to really make a big difference in helping elevate the age of participation for women. And there are many other areas we have to be attentive to. Our medical research dollars need to be sure that we are equally investing in women as men. Our tax systems have to ensure that we don\\x92t either deliberately or inadvertently discriminate against women. And women should be given the same opportunities to be productive and contributing members of society. But big and bold ideas, I think are called for in our world today, because a lot of what we\\x92re doing is not achieving the outcomes that we are seeking. There is a stimulative and ripple effect that kicks in when women have greater access to jobs and the economic fortunes of their families, their communities, and their countries. Many people say that there are all kinds of benefits that will flow from this, but I want to be somewhat modest in our goals. Yes, I do think it will produce more food and more educational opportunity and more financial stability for more families around the world, and that will have dividends across the full spectrum of society. But our declaration will be meaningless if we don\\x92t put our will and effort behind it. I think this summit just might make the history books if people look back in years to come and say, that meeting in San Francisco with all of those important people from across the Asia Pacific said something that had never been said before. They didn\\x92t just assert that involving women was the good thing to do or the right thing to do. They put their heads together and came up with a declaration committing themselves to really tackle the obstacles, because it will benefit the people we all represent. And then we need to measure our progress to be sure that we are tracking what we care about. We obviously do that in our own lives, but it\\x92s important we do it across our countries and our regions. And I am sure that if we leave this summit and go back to our governments and our businesses and focus on how we\\x92re going to improve employment, bring down national debts, create greater trade between us, tackling all of that, and always in the back of our mind keep in focus what more can we do to make sure women contribute to those results, we will see progress and we will be in the lead at not only asserting what we think should be done, but in measuring and tracking how well we are doing. So I thank you for gathering here in San Francisco, mindful that we\\x92re on a long journey together. I look out and I see friends from across the region representing countries that have been so amazing in the progress that you have made in the last 50 years, even in the last 30 years. It will take time. It will take our concerted effort. But I am convinced that if we come into pursuing the promise of this participation age and unleashing and harnessing the economic potential of women, we will see a new and better future. That is why I am honored to be here representing the people of the United States, bearing witness to what begins right here in San Francisco, on September 16th, 2011. This is the beginning of a very promising future for us all. Thank you very much.',\n",

Ladies and gentlemen, the lower \\r\\neconomic and lower middle economic people are not holding their end in this \\r\\ndeal. In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. \\r\\nIn the old days, you couldn\\x92t hooky school because every drawn shade was an eye. \\r\\nAnd before your mother got off the bus and to the house, she knew exactly where \\r\\nyou had gone, who had gone into the house, and where you got on whatever you had \\r\\none and where you got it from. Parents don\\x92t know that today. I\\x92m talking about these people who \\r\\ncry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he \\r\\nwas two? Where were you when he was twelve? Where were you when he was eighteen, \\r\\nand how come you don\\x92t know he had a pistol? And where is his father, and why \\r\\ndon\\x92t you know where he is? And why doesn\\x92t the father show up to talk to this \\r\\nboy? The church is only open on Sunday. \\r\\nAnd you can\\x92t keep asking Jesus to ask doing things for you. You \\r\\ncan\\x92t keep asking that God will find a way. God is tired of you. God was there \\r\\nwhen they won all those cases -- fifty in a row. That\\x92s \\r\\nwhere God was because these people were doing something. And God said, \\x93I\\x92m \\r\\ngoing to find a way.\\x94 I wasn\\x92t there when God said it -- I\\x92m making this up. But it sounds like what God would do. We cannot blame white people. White \\r\\npeople -- White people don\\x92t live over there. They close up the shop \\r\\nearly. The Korean ones still don\\x92t know us as well -- they stay open 24 hours. I\\x92m looking and I see a man named \\r\\nKenneth Clark, he and his wife Mamie. Kenneth\\x92s still alive. I have to apologize \\r\\nto him for these people because Kenneth said it straight. He said you have to \\r\\nstrengthen yourselves, and we\\x92ve got to have that black doll. And everybody said \\r\\nit. Julian Bond said it. Dick Gregory said it. All these lawyers said it. And \\r\\nyou wouldn\\x92t know that anybody had done a damned thing. Fifty percent drop out rate, I\\x92m \\r\\ntelling you, and people in jail, and women having children by five, six \\r\\ndifferent men. Under what excuse? I want somebody to love me. And as soon as you \\r\\nhave it, you forget to parent. Grandmother, mother, and great grandmother in the \\r\\nsame room, raising children, and the child knows nothing about love or respect \\r\\nof any one of the three of them. All this child knows is \\x93gimme, gimme, gimme.\\x94 These people want to buy the friendship of a child, and the child \\r\\ncouldn\\x92t care less. Those of us sitting out here who have gone on to some \\r\\ncollege or whatever we\\x92ve done, we still fear our parents. And these people are not parenting. They\\x92re buying things for the \\r\\nkid -- $500 sneakers -- for what? They won\\x92t buy or spend $250 onHooked on Phonics. Kenneth Clark, somewhere in his \\r\\nhome in upstate New York -- just looking ahead. Thank God he doesn\\x92t know what\\x92s \\r\\ngoing on. Thank God. But these people -- the ones up here in the balcony fought so \\r\\nhard. Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are \\r\\npeople going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting shot in the back of the \\r\\nhead over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged: \\x93The cops \\r\\nshouldn\\x92t have shot him.\\x94 What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his \\r\\nhand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as \\r\\nanybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something \\r\\ncalled parenting said if you get caught with it you\\x92re going to embarrass your \\r\\nmother.\" Not, \"You\\x92re going to get your butt kicked.\" No. \"You\\x92re going to embarrass \\r\\nyour mother.\" \"You\\x92re going to embarrass your family.\" If you knock that girl up, you\\x92re going \\r\\nto have to run away because it\\x92s going to be too embarrassing for your family. \\r\\nIn the old days, a girl getting pregnant had to go down South, and then her \\r\\nmother would go down to get her. But the mother had the baby. I said the mother \\r\\nhad the baby. The girl didn\\x92t have a baby. The mother had the baby in two weeks. \\r\\nWe are not parenting. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to these people. \\r\\nThey are showing you what\\x92s wrong. People putting their clothes on backwards. \\r\\nIsn\\x92t that a sign of something going on wrong?\\xa0Are you not paying attention? \\r\\nPeople \\r\\nwith their hat on backwards, pants down around the crack. Isn\\x92t that a sign of \\r\\nsomething or are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up? Isn\\x92t it a sign of something when she\\x92s got her dress all the way up \\r\\nto the crack -- and got all kinds of needles and things going through her body. \\r\\nWhat part of Africa did this come from? We are not Africans. Those \\r\\npeople are not Africans; they don\\x92t know a damned thing about Africa. With names \\r\\nlike Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all that crap and all of them are in jail. \\r\\n(When we give these kinds names to our children, we give them the strength and \\r\\ninspiration in the meaning of those names. What\\x92s the point of giving them \\r\\nstrong names if there is not parenting and values backing it up). Brown versus the Board of Education \\r\\nis no longer the white person\\x92s problem. We\\x92ve got to take the neighborhood \\r\\nback. We\\x92ve got to go in there. Just forget telling your child to go to the \\r\\nPeace Corps. It\\x92s right around the corner. It\\x92s standing on the corner. It can\\x92t \\r\\nspeak English. It doesn\\x92t want to speak English. I can\\x92t even talk the way these \\r\\npeople talk: \\x93Why you ain\\x92t where you is go ra?\\x94 I don\\x92t \\r\\nknow who these people are. And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to \\r\\ntalk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to \\r\\nEnglish. Everybody knows it\\x92s important to speak English except these \\r\\nknuckleheads. You can\\x92t land a plane with, \\x93Why you ain\\x92t\\x85\\x94 You can\\x92t be a doctor \\r\\nwith that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. There is no Bible that has that \\r\\nkind of language. Where did these people get the idea that they\\x92re moving ahead \\r\\non this. Well, they know they\\x92re not; they\\x92re just hanging out in the same \\r\\nplace, five or six generations sitting in the projects when you\\x92re just supposed \\r\\nto stay there long enough to get a job and move out. Now, look, I\\x92m telling you. It\\x92s not \\r\\nwhat they\\x92re doing to us. It\\x92s what we\\x92re not doing. 50 percent drop out. Look, \\r\\nwe\\x92re raising our own ingrown immigrants. These people are fighting hard to be \\r\\nignorant. There\\x92s no English being spoken, and they\\x92re walking and they\\x92re \\r\\nangry. Oh God, they\\x92re angry and they have pistols and they shoot and they do \\r\\nstupid things. And after they kill somebody, they don\\x92t have a plan. Just murder \\r\\nsomebody. Boom. Over what? A pizza? And then run to the poor cousin\\x92s house. They sit there and the cousin says, \\x93What are you doing here?\\x94 \\x93I just killed \\r\\nsomebody, man.\\x94 \\x93What?\\x94 \\x93I just killed somebody; I\\x92ve got to stay here.\\x94 \\x93No, \\r\\nyou don\\x92t.\\x94 \\x93Well, give me some money, I\\x92ll go\\x85.\\x94 \\x93Where are you going?\\x94 \\x93North \\r\\nCarolina.\\x94 Everybody wanted to go to North Carolina. But the police know where \\r\\nyou\\x92re going because your cousin has a record. Five or six different children -- same \\r\\nwoman, eight, ten different husbands or whatever. Pretty soon you\\x92re going to \\r\\nhave to have DNA cards so you can tell who you\\x92re making love to. You don\\x92t who \\r\\nthis is. It might be your grandmother. I\\x92m telling you, they\\x92re young \\r\\nenough. Hey, you have a baby when you\\x92re twelve. Your baby turns thirteen and \\r\\nhas a baby, how old are you? Huh? Grandmother. By the time you\\x92re twelve, you \\r\\ncould have sex with your grandmother, you keep those numbers coming. I\\x92m just \\r\\npredicting. I\\x92m saying Brown versus the Board of \\r\\nEducation. We\\x92ve got to hit the streets, ladies and gentlemen. I\\x92m winding up, \\r\\nnow -- no more applause. I\\x92m saying, look at the Black Muslims. There are Black \\r\\nMuslims standing on the street corners and they say so forth and so on, and \\r\\nwe\\x92re laughing at them because they have bean pies and all that, but you don\\x92t \\r\\nread, \\x93Black Muslim gunned down while chastising drug dealer.\\x94 You don\\x92t read \\r\\nthat. They don\\x92t shoot down Black Muslims. You understand me. Muslims tell you \\r\\nto get out of the neighborhood. When you want to clear your neighborhood out, \\r\\nfirst thing you do is go get the Black Muslims, bean pies and all. \\r\\nAnd your neighborhood is then clear. The police can\\x92t do it. I\\x92m telling you Christians, what\\x92s \\r\\nwrong with you? Why can\\x92t you hit the streets? Why can\\x92t you clean it out \\r\\nyourselves? It\\x92s our time now, ladies and gentlemen. It is our time. \\r\\nAnd I\\x92ve got good news for you. It\\x92s not about money. It\\x92s about you doing \\r\\nsomething ordinarily that we do -- get in somebody else\\x92s business. It\\x92s time for \\r\\nyou to not accept the language that these people are speaking, which will take \\r\\nthem nowhere. What the hell good is Brown v. Board of Education if nobody wants \\r\\nit? What is it with young girls getting \\r\\nafter some girl who wants to still remain a virgin. Who are these sick black \\r\\npeople and where did they come from and why haven\\x92t they been parented to shut \\r\\nup? To go up to girls and try to get a club where \\x93you are nobody....\\x94 This is a \\r\\nsickness, ladies and gentlemen, and we are not paying attention to these children. \\r\\nThese are children. They don\\x92t know anything. They don\\x92t have anything. They\\x92re \\r\\nhomeless people. All they know how to do is beg. And you give it to them, trying \\r\\nto win their friendship. And what are they good for? And then they stand there \\r\\nin an orange suit and you drop to your knees: \\x93He didn\\x92t do \\r\\nanything. He didn\\x92t do anything.\\x94 Yes, he did do it. And you need to have an \\r\\norange suit on, too. So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to \\r\\nthank you for the award -- and giving me an opportunity to speak \\r\\nbecause, I mean, this is the future, and all of these people who lined up and \\r\\ndone -- they\\x92ve got to be wondering what the hell happened. Brown V. Board of \\r\\nEducation -- these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and \\r\\npunched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking \\r\\naround who don\\x92t want to learn English. I know that you all know it. I \\r\\njust want to get you as angry that you ought to be. When you walk around the \\r\\nneighborhood and you see this stuff, that stuff\\x92s not funny. These people are \\r\\nnot funny anymore. And that\\x91s not my brother. And that\\x92s not my sister. They\\x92re \\r\\nfaking and they\\x92re dragging me way down because the state, the city, and all \\r\\nthese people have to pick up the tab on them because they don\\x92t want to accept \\r\\nthat they have to study to get an education. We have to begin to build in the \\r\\nneighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real \\r\\nestate, have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all. And so, ladies \\r\\nand gentlemen, please, Dorothy Height, where ever she\\x92s sitting, she didn\\x92t do \\r\\nall that stuff so that she could hear somebody say \\x93I can\\x92t stand algebra, I \\r\\ncan\\x92t stand\\x85\" and \\x93what you is.\\x94 It\\x92s horrible. Basketball players -- \\r\\nmultimillionaires can\\x92t write a paragraph. Football players, multimillionaires, \\r\\ncan\\x92t read. Yes. Multimillionaires. Well, Brown v. Board of Education, where are \\r\\nwe today? It\\x92s there. They paved the way. What did we do with it? The White Man, \\r\\nhe\\x92s laughing -- got to be laughing. 50 percent drop out -- rest of them in prison. You got to tell me that if there was \\r\\nparenting -- help me -- if there was parenting, he wouldn\\x92t have picked up the Coca \\r\\nCola bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head. He \\r\\nwouldn\\x92t have. Not if he loved his parents. And not if they were parenting! Not \\r\\nif the father would come home. Not if the boy hadn\\x92t dropped the sperm cell \\r\\ninside of the girl and the girl had said, \\x93No, you have to come back here and be \\r\\nthe father of this child.\\x94 Not ..\\x93I don\\x92t have to.\\x94 Therefore, you have the pile up of \\r\\nthese sweet beautiful things born by nature -- raised by no one. Give them \\r\\npresents. You\\x92re raising pimps. That\\x92s what a pimp is. A pimp will act nasty to \\r\\nyou so you have to go out and get them something. And then you bring it back and \\r\\nmaybe he or she hugs you. And that\\x92s why pimp is so famous. They\\x92ve got a drink \\r\\ncalled the \\x93Pimp-something.\\x94 You all wonder what that\\x92s about, don\\x92t you? Well, \\r\\nyou\\x92re probably going to let Jesus figure it out for you. Well, I\\x92ve \\r\\ngot something to tell you about Jesus. When you go to the church, look at the \\r\\nstained glass things of Jesus. Look at them. Is Jesus smiling? Not in one \\r\\npicture. So, tell your friends. Let\\x92s try to do something. Let\\x92s try to make \\r\\nJesus smile. Let\\x92s start parenting. Thank you, thank you.',\n",
       " 'Hillary Clinton:I am very optimistic about \\r\\nthis election because I think I know a great leader when I see one. And so does \\r\\nAmerica. In 1992 and 1996, Americans chose a President who left our country in \\r\\nbetter shape than when he took office. And he still spends his days working to \\r\\nempower the powerless; to promote racial, religious, and ethnic reconciliation; \\r\\nto inspire young people to citizen service; and to bring life-saving medicines \\r\\nto people living with HIV-AIDS throughout the world. He showed Democrats how to \\r\\nwin again and so will John Kerry. Please welcome the 42nd President of the \\r\\nUnited States, Bill Clinton! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Bill Clinton:Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies \\r\\nand gentlemen. Thank you. Calm down! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be here \\r\\nwith you -- I am honored to share this podium with my Senator, Hillary Rodham \\r\\nClinton, and I wanna thank the people of New York for giving the best public \\r\\nservant in my family a chance to continue serving the public. Thank you. I am also -- I\\'m gonna say that again, in case \\r\\nyou didn\\'t hear it: I\\'m honored to be here tonight, and I wanna thank the people \\r\\nof New York for giving Hillary a chance to continue to serve in public life. I \\r\\nam very proud of her, and we are both very grateful to all of you, especially my \\r\\ngood friends from Arkansas, for giving me the chance to serve in the White House \\r\\nfor eight years. I am honored to share this night with President \\r\\nCarter, for whom I worked in 1976 and who has inspired the world with his work \\r\\nfor peace, democracy, and human rights. I am honored to share it with Al Gore, \\r\\nmy friend and my partner for eight years, who played such a large role in \\r\\nbuilding the prosperity and peace that we left America in 2000. And Al Gore, as \\r\\nhe showed again tonight, demonstrated incredible patriotism and grace under \\r\\npressure. He is the living embodiment of the principle that every vote counts, \\r\\nand this year we\\'re gonna make sure they\\'re all counted in every state in \\r\\nAmerica. My friends, after three conventions as a \\r\\ncandidate or a President, tonight I come to you as a citizen, returning to the \\r\\nrole that I have played for most of my life; as a foot soldier in our fight for \\r\\nthe future as we nominate in Boston a true New England patriot for President. \\r\\nNow this state, who gave us in other times of challenge John Adams and John \\r\\nKennedy, has given us John Kerry, a good man, a great senator, a visionary \\r\\nleader. And we are all here to do what we can to make him the next President of \\r\\nthe United States. My friends, we are constantly being told that \\r\\nAmerica is deeply divided. But all Americans value freedom and faith and family. \\r\\nWe all honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform in Iraq, \\r\\nAfghanistan, and throughout the world. We all want good jobs, good schools, \\r\\nhealth care, safe streets, a clean environment. We all want our children to grow \\r\\nup in a secure America, leading the world toward a peaceful and prosperous \\r\\nfuture. Our differences are in how we can best achieve \\r\\nthese things in a time of unprecedented change. Therefore, we Democrats will \\r\\nbring to the American people this year a positive campaign, arguing not who\\'s a \\r\\ngood or a bad person, but what is the best way to build the safe and prosperous \\r\\nworld our children deserve. The 21st century is marked by serious security \\r\\nthreats, serious economic challenges, and serious problems, from AIDS to global \\r\\nwarming to the continuing turmoil in the Middle East. But it also full of \\r\\namazing opportunities -- to create millions of new jobs, and clean energy, and \\r\\nbiotechnology; to restore our manufacturing base and reap the benefits of the \\r\\nglobal economy through our diversity and our commitment to decent labor and \\r\\nenvironmental standards for people all across the world; and to create a world \\r\\nwhere we can celebrate our religious, our racial, our ethnic, our tribal \\r\\ndifferences because our common humanity matters most of all. To build that kind of world, we must make the \\r\\nright choices, and we must have a President who will lead the way. Democrats and \\r\\nRepublicans have very different and deeply felt ideas about what choices we \\r\\nshould make. They\\'re rooted in fundamentally different views of how we should \\r\\nmeet our common challenges at home and how we should play our role in the world. We Democrats want to build a world and an \\r\\nAmerica of shared responsibilities and shared benefits. We want a world with \\r\\nmore global cooperation, where we act alone only when we absolutely have to. We \\r\\nthink the role of government should give -- should be to give people the tools \\r\\nand to create the conditions to make the most of their own lives, and we think \\r\\neverybody should have that chance.  On the other hand, the Republicans in \\r\\nWashington believe that America should be run by the \"right\" people -- their \\r\\npeople -- in a world in which America acts unilaterally when we can and \\r\\ncooperates when we have to. They believe the role of government is to \\r\\nconcentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their economic, \\r\\npolitical, and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on \\r\\nimportant matters like health care and retirement security. Now since most \\r\\nAmericans aren\\'t that far to the right, our friends have to portray us Democrats \\r\\nas simply unacceptable, lacking in strength and values; in other words, they \\r\\nneed a divided America. But we don\\'t. Americans -- Americans long to be united. After \\r\\n9/11, we all just wanted to be one nation. Not a single American on September \\r\\nthe 12th, 2001 cared who won the next presidential election. All we wanted to do \\r\\nwas to be one country, strong in the fight against terror, helping to heal those \\r\\nwho were wounded and the families of those who lost their loved ones, reaching \\r\\nout to the rest of the world so we could meet these new challenges and go on \\r\\nwith our democratic way of life. The President had an amazing opportunity to \\r\\nbring the country together under his slogan of compassionate conservatism, and \\r\\nto unite the world in the struggle against terror. Instead, he and his congressional allies made a \\r\\nvery different choice. They chose to move that -- to use that moment of unity to \\r\\ntry to push the country too far to the right and to walk away from our allies, \\r\\nnot only in attacking in Iraq before the weapons inspectors had finished their \\r\\nwork but in withdrawing American support for the climate change treaty and for \\r\\nthe international court on war criminals and from the Anti-Ballistic Missile \\r\\nTreaty and from the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Now -- now, at a time when we\\'re trying to get \\r\\nother people to give up nuclear and biological and chemical weapons, they are \\r\\ntrying to develop two new nuclear weapons, which they say we might use first. At home -- at home, the President and the \\r\\nRepublican Congress have made equally fateful choices, which they also deeply \\r\\nbelieve in. For the first time when America was on a war footing in our whole \\r\\nhistory, they gave two huge tax cuts, nearly half of which went to the top 1 \\r\\npercent of us. Now, I\\'m in that group for the first time in my \\r\\nlife. And you might remember that when I was in office, on occasion, the \\r\\nRepublicans were kind of mean to me. But soon as I got out and made money, I \\r\\nbegan part of the most important group in the world to them. It was amazing. I \\r\\n-- I never thought I\\'d be so well cared for by the President and the Republicans \\r\\nin Congress. I -- I almost sent them a thank-you note \\r\\nfor my tax cuts -- until I realized that the rest of you were paying for the \\r\\nbill for it, and then I thought better of it. Now, look at the choices they made, choices \\r\\nthey believed in. They chose to protect my tax cut at all costs, while \\r\\nwithholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leaving 2.1 \\r\\nmillion children behind. While they chose to protect my tax cut, while cutting \\r\\n140,000 unemployed workers out of their job-training programs, a hundred \\r\\nthousand working families out of their child-care assistance, and worst of all, \\r\\nwhile cutting 300,000 poor children out of their after-school programs when we \\r\\nknow it keeps them off the streets, out of trouble, in school learning, going to \\r\\ncollege and having a good life. They chose -- they chose to protect my tax cuts \\r\\nwhile dramatically raising the out-of-pocket costs of health care to our \\r\\nveterans, and while weakening or reversing very important environmental measures \\r\\nthat Al Gore and I put into place, everything from clean air to the protection \\r\\nof our forests. Now, in this time, everyone in America had to \\r\\nsacrifice except the wealthiest Americans. And most of us, all most all of us, \\r\\nfrom Republicans to Independents and Democrats, we wanted to be asked to do our \\r\\npart too, but all they asked us to do was to expend the energy necessary to open \\r\\nthe envelopes containing our tax cuts. Now, if you like these choices and you agree \\r\\nwith them, you should vote to return them to the White House and the Congress. \\r\\nIf not, take a look at John Kerry, John Edwards, and the Democrats. We\\'ve got a \\r\\ndifferent economic policy. In this year\\'s budget -- in this year\\'s budget, \\r\\nthe White House this year wants to cut off all the federal funding for 88,000 \\r\\nuniformed police officers under the COPS program we\\'ve had for 10 years. Among \\r\\nthose 88,000 police are more than 700 members of the New York Police Department \\r\\nwho put their lives on the line on 9/11. With gang violence rising and with all \\r\\nof us looking for terrorists in our midst and hoping they\\'re not too well armed \\r\\nor too well dangerous -- too dangerous, the President and the Congress are about \\r\\nto allow the 10-year-old ban on deadly assault weapons to lapse. Now, they believe it\\'s the right thing to do, \\r\\nbut our policy was to put more police on the street and to take assault weapons \\r\\noff the street, and it gave you eight years of declining crime and eight years \\r\\nof declining violence. Their policy is the reverse. They\\'re taking police off \\r\\nthe streets while they put assault weapons back on the street. Now if you agree \\r\\nwith that choice, by all means vote to keep them in office. But if you don\\'t, \\r\\njoin John Kerry, John Edwards, and the Democrats in making America safer, \\r\\nsmarter and stronger again. On homeland security -- on homeland security, \\r\\nDemocrats tried to double the number of containers at ports and airports checked \\r\\nfor weapons of mass destruction. It cost a billion dollars. It would have been \\r\\npaid for under our bill by asking the 200,000 millionaires in America to cut \\r\\ntheir tax cut by 5000 dollars. Almost all 200,000 of us would like to have done \\r\\nthat, to spend 5000 dollars to make all 300 million Americans feel safer. The \\r\\nmeasure failed. Why? Because the White House and the Republican leadership in \\r\\nthe House of Representatives opposed it. They thought our 5000 dollars was more \\r\\nimportant than doubling the container checks at our ports and airports. If you \\r\\nagree with that, by all means reelect them. If not, John Kerry and John Edwards \\r\\nare your team for the future. These policies have turned a projected 5.8 \\r\\ntrillion dollar surplus that we left -- enough to pay for the baby-boomer \\r\\nretirement -- into a projected debt of almost 5 trillion dollars, with over 400 \\r\\nbillion dollars in deficit this year and for years to come. Now, how do they pay \\r\\nfor that deficit? First, by taking the Social Security surplus that comes in \\r\\nevery month and endorsing the checks of working people over to me to pay for the \\r\\ntax cut. But it\\'s not enough, so then they have to go borrow money. Most of it \\r\\nthey borrow from the Chinese and the Japanese government. Sure these countries \\r\\nare competing with us for good jobs, but how can we enforce our trade laws \\r\\nagainst our bankers? I mean, come on. So, if you think -- if you believe it is good \\r\\npolicy, if you believe it is good policy to pay for my tax cuts with the Social \\r\\nSecurity checks of working men and women, and borrowed money from China and \\r\\nJapan, you should vote for them. If not, John Kerry\\'s your man. We Americans must choose for President -- we\\'ve \\r\\ngot to choose for President between two strong men who both love their country, \\r\\nbut who have very different world views: our nominee, John Kerry, who favors \\r\\nshared responsibility, shared opportunity, and more global cooperation; and \\r\\ntheir President and their party in Congress who favor concentrated wealth and \\r\\npower, leaving people to fend for themselves, and more unilateral action. I think we\\'re right for two reasons. First of \\r\\nall, America just works better when more people have a chance to live their \\r\\ndreams. And secondly, we live in an interdependent world in which we cannot \\r\\npossibly kill, jail, or occupy all our potential adversaries. So we have to both \\r\\nfight terror and build a world with more partners and fewer terrorists.  Now we tried it their way for 12 years. We \\r\\ntried it their way for 12 years. We tried it our way for eight years. Then we \\r\\ntried it their way for four more. By the only test that matters, whether people \\r\\nwere better off when we finished than when we started, our way works better. It produced over 22 million good jobs, rising \\r\\nincomes for the middle class -- over a hundred times as many people moved from \\r\\npoverty into the middle class -- more health care, the largest increase in \\r\\ncollege aid in 50 years, record homeownership, a cleaner environment, three \\r\\nsurpluses in a row, a modernized defense force, strong efforts against terror, \\r\\nand a respected America in the world. It worked better. More importantly -- more importantly, we have \\r\\ngreat new champions in John Kerry and John Edwards, two good men with wonderful \\r\\nwives: Teresa, a generous and wise woman who understands the world we\\'re trying \\r\\nto shape; and Elizabeth, a lawyer and mother who understands the lives we\\'re \\r\\ntrying to lift. Now let me tell you what I know about John \\r\\nKerry. I\\'ve been seeing all the Republican ads about him. Let me tell you what I \\r\\nknow about him. During the Vietnam War, many young men, including the current \\r\\nPresident, the Vice President and me, could have gone to Vietnam and didn\\'t. \\r\\nJohn Kerry came from a privileged background. He could have avoided going, too. \\r\\nBut instead he said, \"Send me.\" When -- when they sent those swift boats up the \\r\\nriver in Vietnam, and they told them their job was to draw hostile fire, to wave \\r\\nthe American flag and bait the enemy to come out and fight, John Kerry said, \\r\\n\"Send me.\" And then, on my watch, when it was time to heal \\r\\nthe wounds of war and normalize relations with Vietnam and to demand an \\r\\naccounting of the POWs and MIAs we lost there, John Kerry said, \"Send me.\" Then, when we needed someone to push the cause \\r\\nof inner-city children struggling to avoid a life of crime, or to bring the \\r\\nbenefits of high technology to ordinary Americans, or to clean the environment \\r\\nin a way that created new jobs, or to give small businesses a better chance to \\r\\nmake it, John Kerry said, \"Send me.\" So tonight, my friends, I ask you to join me \\r\\nfor the next 100 days in telling John Kerry\\'s story, in promoting his ideas. Let \\r\\nevery person in this hall and like-minded people all across our land say to him \\r\\nwhat he has always said to America: \"Send me.\" The bravery -- the bravery that men who fought \\r\\nby his side in battle, that bravery they saw in battle I have seen in politics. \\r\\nWhen I was President, John Kerry showed courage and conviction on crime, on \\r\\nwelfare reform, on balancing the budget, at a time when those priorities were \\r\\nnot exactly the way to win a popularity contest in our party. John Kerry took \\r\\ntough positions on tough problems. He knows who he is and where he\\'s going. He \\r\\nhas the experience, the character, the ideas, the values to be a great \\r\\nPresident. And in a time of change, he has two other very important qualities: \\r\\nan insatiable curiosity to understand the world around him and a willingness to \\r\\nhear other views, even those who disagree with him. Therefore, John Kerry will \\r\\nmake choices that reflect both conviction and common sense. He proved that when \\r\\nhe picked John Edwards to be his partner. Now, everybody talks about John Edwards\\' energy \\r\\nand intellect and charisma. You know, I kind of resent him. But the important \\r\\nthing is not what talents he has, but how he has used them. He chose, he chose \\r\\nto use his talents to improve the lives of people like him who had to work for \\r\\neverything they\\'ve got, and to help people too often left out and left behind. \\r\\nAnd that\\'s what he\\'ll do as our Vice President. Now their opponents will tell you -- their \\r\\nopponents will tell you we should be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards \\r\\nbecause they won\\'t stand up to the terrorists. Don\\'t you believe it: Strength and wisdom are \\r\\nnot opposing values. They go hand in hand. They go hand in hand, and John Kerry has both. \\r\\nHis first priority will be to keep America safe. Remember the Scripture, \"Be not \\r\\nafraid.\" John Kerry and John Edwards are good people with good ideas, ideas to \\r\\nmake the economy work again for middle class Americans, to restore fiscal \\r\\nresponsibility, to save Social Security, to make health care more affordable and \\r\\ncollege more available, to free us from dependence on foreign oil and create new \\r\\njobs with clean energy and a cleaner environment, to rally the world -- to rally \\r\\nthe world to our side in the war against terror, and to make a world with more \\r\\nfriends and less terror.  My friends, at every turning point in our \\r\\nhistory, we the people have chosen unity over division, heeding our founders\\' \\r\\ncall to America\\'s eternal mission to form a more perfect union, to widen the \\r\\ncircle of opportunity, deepen the reach of freedom, and strengthen the bonds of \\r\\nour community. It happened every time because we made the right choices. In the early days of the Republic, America was \\r\\ndivided and at a crossroads, much as it is today, deeply divided over whether or \\r\\nnot to build a real nation with a national economy and a national legal system. \\r\\nWe chose to build a more perfect union. In the Civil War, America was at another \\r\\ncrossroads, deeply divided over whether to save the union and end slavery. We \\r\\nchose a more perfect union. In the 1960s, when I was a young man, we were \\r\\ndivided again over civil rights and women\\'s rights. And again we chose to form a \\r\\nmore perfect union. As I said in 1992, I say again tonight: we are \\r\\nall in this together. We have an obligation both to work hard and to help our \\r\\nfellow citizens, an obligation both to fight terror and to build a world with \\r\\nmore cooperation and less terror. Now, again, it is time to choose. Since we\\'re all in the same boat, we should \\r\\nchoose a captain of our ship who is a brave, good man, who knows how to steer a \\r\\nvessel through troubled waters to the calm seas and the clear skies of our more \\r\\nperfect union. That is our mission! So let us join tonight and say to America in \\r\\na loud, clear voice: \"Send John Kerry!\" God bless you.',\n",
       " 'Mr. President: I\\'ve --\\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92ve stood in this place many times and addressed as president many \\r\\n\\t\\tpresiding officers. I\\'ve been so addressed when I\\'ve sat in that \\r\\n\\t\\tchair, and that\\'s as close as I\\'ll ever be to a Presidency.  But anyway.... It is an honorific we\\x92re almost indifferent to, isn\\x92t it. In truth, \\r\\n\\t\\tpresiding over the Senate can be a nuisance, a bit of a ceremonial bore, \\r\\n\\t\\tand it is usually relegated to the more junior members of the majority. But as I stand here today --looking a little worse for wear, I\\x92m sure \\r\\n\\t\\t-- I \\r\\n\\t\\thave a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of this \\r\\n\\t\\tbody, and for the other 99 privileged souls who have been \\r\\n\\t\\telected to this Senate. I\\'ve been a member of the United States Senate for 30 years.\\xa0 I \\r\\n\\t\\thad another long, if not as long,career before I arrived here, another \\r\\n\\t\\tprofession that was profoundly rewarding, and in which I had experiences \\r\\n\\t\\tand friendships that I revere. But make no mistake, my service here is \\r\\n\\t\\tthe most important job I\\'ve had in my life. And I am so grateful -- so \\r\\n\\t\\tgrateful -- to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe people of Arizona for the privilege, for the honor of serving \\r\\n\\t\\there and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the \\r\\n\\t\\thistory of the country that I love. I\\x92ve known and...admired men and women in the Senate who played much more \\r\\n\\t\\tthan a small role in our history -- true statesmen, giants of American \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitics. They come from both parties and from various backgrounds. \\r\\n\\t\\tTheir ambitions were frequently in conflict. They held different views \\r\\n\\t\\ton the issues of the day. And they often had very serious disagreements \\r\\n\\t\\tabout how best to serve the national interest. But they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however \\r\\n\\t\\tkeen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to \\r\\n\\t\\tensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities \\r\\n\\t\\teffectively. Our responsibilities are important, vitally important, to \\r\\n\\t\\tthe continued success of our Republic. And our arcane rules and customs \\r\\n\\t\\tare deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well \\r\\n\\t\\tat all. The most revered members of this institution accepted the \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica\\x92s problems and defend her from her adversaries. That principled mindset, and the service of our predecessors who \\r\\n\\t\\tpossessed it, come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld\\x92s greatest deliberative body. I\\x92m not sure we can claim that \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinction with a straight face today. I\\x92m sure it wasn\\x92t always deserved in previous eras either. But I\\x92m sure \\r\\n\\t\\tthese -- there have been -- been times when it was, and I was privileged to witness some \\r\\n\\t\\tof those occasions. Our deliberations today -- not just our debates, but the exercise of all \\r\\n\\t\\tof our responsibilities -- authorizing government policies, appropriating \\r\\n\\t\\tthe funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role -- \\r\\n\\t\\tare often lively and interesting. They can be as sincere and principled. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut they\\'re more partisan, more tribal more of the time than at any  \\r\\n\\t\\ttime that I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut I think we\\x92d all agree they haven\\x92t been overburdened by greatness \\r\\n\\t\\tlately. And right now they aren\\x92t producing much for the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. Both sides have let this happen. Let\\x92s leave the history of who shot \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst to the historians. I suspect they\\x92ll find we all conspired in our \\r\\n\\t\\tdecline, either by deliberate actions or neglect. We\\x92ve all played some \\r\\n\\t\\trole in it. Certainly, I have. Sometimes, I\\x92ve let my passion rule my \\r\\n\\t\\treason. Sometimes, I\\'ve made it harder to find common ground because of \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy. Incremental progress, compromises that each side criticize but also \\r\\n\\t\\taccept, just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and keep \\r\\n\\t\\tour enemies from doing their worst isn\\x92t glamorous or exciting. It \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\x92t feel like a political triumph. But it\\x92s usually the most we can \\r\\n\\t\\texpect from our system of government, operating in a country as diverse \\r\\n\\t\\tand quarrelsome and free as ours. Considering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernments, and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem \\r\\n\\t\\tsolving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, \\r\\n\\t\\tand the liberty and justice it preserves, is a magnificent achievement. Our system doesn\\x92t depend on our nobility. It accounts for our \\r\\n\\t\\timperfections and gives an order to our individual strivings that has \\r\\n\\t\\thelped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth. It \\r\\n\\t\\tis our responsibility to preserve that, and even when it requires us to do \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething less satisfying than \"winning\"; even when we must give a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle to get a little; even when our efforts manage just three yards \\r\\n\\t\\tand a cloud of dust, while critics on both sides denounce us for \\r\\n\\t\\ttimidity, for our failure to \"triumph.\" I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our \\r\\n\\t\\tdependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again, and by \\r\\n\\t\\tso doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the \\r\\n\\t\\tbombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To \\r\\n\\t\\thell with them. They don\\x92t want anything done for the public good. Our \\r\\n\\t\\tincapacity is their livelihood. Let\\x92s trust each other. Let\\x92s return to regular order. We\\x92ve been \\r\\n\\t\\tspinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying \\r\\n\\t\\tto find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That\\x92s an \\r\\n\\t\\tapproach that\\x92s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe top down, without any support from the other side, with all the \\r\\n\\t\\tparliamentary maneuvers that requires. We\\x92re getting nothing done, my friends. We\\'re getting nothing done! And all we\\x92ve really done this year is confirmNeil Gorsuchto the Supreme Court. Our healthcare insurance system is a \\r\\n\\t\\tmess. We all know it, those who support Obamacare and those who oppose \\r\\n\\t\\tit. Something has to be done. We Republicans have looked for a way to \\r\\n\\t\\tend it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical price. We haven\\x92t found it yet, and I\\x92m not sure we will. All \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\x92ve managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn\\x92t very \\r\\n\\t\\tpopular when we started trying to get rid of it. I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and \\r\\n\\t\\tamendments to be offered. I will not vote for this bill as it is today. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\x92s a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged \\r\\n\\t\\tby my state\\x92s governor that will have to be included to earn my support \\r\\n\\t\\tfor final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the \\r\\n\\t\\tbill changed substantially for you to support it.\\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors \\r\\n\\t\\tin consultation with the Administration, then springing it on skeptical \\r\\n\\t\\tmembers, trying to convince them that\\'s it\\x92s better than nothing -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s better than nothing? -- asking us to \\r\\n\\t\\tswallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don\\x92t think \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\'s going to work in the end -- and probably shouldn\\x92t. The [Obama] Administration and congressional Democrats shouldn\\x92t have \\r\\n\\t\\tforced through Congress without any opposition support a social and \\r\\n\\t\\teconomic change as massive as Obamacare. And we shouldn\\x92t do the same \\r\\n\\t\\twith ours. Why don\\x92t we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our \\r\\n\\t\\trules and customs encourage us to act. If this process ends in failure, \\r\\n\\t\\twhich seem likely, then let\\x92s return to regular order. Let theHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions CommitteeunderChairman \\r\\n\\t\\tAlexander andRanking Member Murrayhold hearings, try to report a bill \\r\\n\\t\\tout of committee with contributions from both sides -- something that my \\r\\n\\t\\tdear friends on the other side of the aisle didn\\'t allow to happen nine \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago. This -- If we -- Let\\'s see if we can pass something \\r\\n\\t\\tthat will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing to \\r\\n\\t\\timplacable partisans on either side, but that might provide workable \\r\\n\\t\\tsolutions to problems Americans are struggling with today. What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92re not getting done much apart. I don\\x92t think -- think any of us feels very \\r\\n\\t\\tproud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing what they want isn\\x92t the most inspiring work. There\\x92s greater \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent \\r\\n\\t\\tagreements that don\\x92t require abandonment of core principles, agreements \\r\\n\\t\\tmade in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. The Senate is capable of that. We know that. We\\x92ve seen it before. I\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tseen it happen many times. And the times when I was involved, even in a \\r\\n\\t\\tmodest way, with working out a bipartisan response to a national problem \\r\\n\\t\\tor threat are the proudest moments of my career, and by far the most \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfying. This place is important. The work we do is important. Our strange rules \\r\\n\\t\\tand seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and insist \\r\\n\\t\\ton our cooperation are important. Our founders envisioned the Senate as \\r\\n\\t\\tthe more deliberative, careful body that operates at a greater distance \\r\\n\\t\\tthan the other body from the public passions of the hour. We are an important check on the powers of the Executive. Our consent is \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessary for the President to appoint jurists and powerful government \\r\\n\\t\\tofficials and in many respects to conduct foreign policy. Whether or not \\r\\n\\t\\twe are of the same party, we are not the President\\x92s subordinates. We \\r\\n\\t\\tare his equal! As his responsibilities -- As his responsibilities are onerous, many and powerful, so are ours.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd we play a vital role in shaping and directing the judiciary, the \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary, and the cabinet, in planning and supporting foreign and \\r\\n\\t\\tdomestic policies. Our success in meeting all these awesome \\r\\n\\t\\tconstitutional obligations depends on cooperation among ourselves. The success of the Senate is important to the continued success of \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica. This country -- this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, \\r\\n\\t\\trestless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good, and \\r\\n\\t\\tmagnificent country -- needs us to help it thrive. That responsibility is \\r\\n\\t\\tmore important than any of our personal interests or political \\r\\n\\t\\taffiliation. We are the servants of a great nation, \"a nation conceived in liberty \\r\\n\\t\\tand dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"1More \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople have free -- have lived free and prosperous lives here than in any other \\r\\n\\t\\tnation. We\\'ve acquired unprecedented wealth and power because of our \\r\\n\\t\\tgoverning principles, and because our government defended those \\r\\n\\t\\tprinciples. America has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational order that has liberated more people from tyranny and \\r\\n\\t\\tpoverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe greatest supporter, and the greatest defender of that order. We \\r\\n\\t\\taren\\x92t afraid. We don\\x92t covet other people\\x92s land and wealth. We don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\thide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity. What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the \\r\\n\\t\\tstrong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the \\r\\n\\t\\tdignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal \\r\\n\\t\\tjustice? That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful \\r\\n\\t\\tand worthy than the small differences that divide us. What a great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in this \\r\\n\\t\\tbody. It\\x92s a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it. Many of you have \\r\\n\\t\\treached out in the last few days with your concern and your prayers, and \\r\\n\\t\\tit means a lot to me. It really does. I\\x92ve had so many people say such \\r\\n\\t\\tnice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me \\r\\n\\t\\tconfused with someone else. I appreciate it though, every word, even if \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch of it isn\\x92t deserved. I\\x92ll be here for a few days, I hope managing the floor debate on the \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense authorization bill, which, I\\x92m proud to say is again a product \\r\\n\\t\\tof bipartisan cooperation and trust among the members of the Senate \\r\\n\\t\\tArmed Services Committee. After that, I\\x92m going home for a while to treat my illness. I have every \\r\\n\\t\\tintention of -- of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe nice things you said about me. And, I hope, to impress on you again \\r\\n\\t\\tthat it is an honor to serve the American people in your company. Thank you, fellow \\r\\n\\t\\tsenators. Mr. President, I yield \\r\\n\\t\\tthe floor.',\n",
       " 'Senator Kennedy and \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinguished fellow Georgians, friends of the Law School of Georgia and \\r\\n\\t\\tpersonal friends of mine: Sometimes even a \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinguished jurist on the Supreme Court doesn\\x92t know all of the \\r\\n\\t\\tbackground about acceptances of invitations. As a matter of fact, my \\r\\n\\t\\twife was influential in it but my son was even more influential. It was \\r\\n\\t\\treally a -- an acceptance to repair my ego. There was established in \\r\\n\\t\\t1969 the L.Q.C. Lamar Society. And I was involved in the establishment \\r\\n\\t\\tof it and think a lot of it. And as Governor of Georgia I was invited \\r\\n\\t\\talong with two other distinguished Americans to make speeches this year \\r\\n\\t\\tat the annual convention or meeting which is going on now. I found out when the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogram was prepared that Senator Kennedy was to speak last night. They \\r\\n\\t\\tcharged ten dollars to attend the occasion. Senator William Brock from \\r\\n\\t\\tTennessee is speaking to the Lamar Society at noon today and I found out \\r\\n\\t\\tthey charged seven dollars -- seven dollars and a half. I spoke \\r\\n\\t\\tyesterday at noon and I asked the Lamar Society officials at the last \\r\\n\\t\\tminute how much they were charging to come to the luncheon yesterday and \\r\\n\\t\\tthey said they weren\\x92t charging anything. I said, \\x93You mean they don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\teven have to pay for their lunch?\\x94 And they said, \\x93No, we\\x92re providing \\r\\n\\t\\tthe lunch free\\x94, they said. So when my son Jack \\r\\n\\t\\tcame and said, \\x93Daddy, I think more of it than you thought I did. I\\x92m \\r\\n\\t\\tpaying seven dollars for two tickets to the luncheon.\\x94 I figured that \\r\\n\\t\\tfor three dollars and a half lunch ticket would salvage part of my ego \\r\\n\\t\\tand that\\x92s really why I\\x92m here today. I\\x92m not qualified to \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk to you all about law because in addition to being a peanut farmer, \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92m an engineer and a nuclear physicist. And I was planning to talk to \\r\\n\\t\\tyou more today about politics and the interrelation of political affairs \\r\\n\\t\\twith laws and then about what I\\x92m actually going to speak on. But after \\r\\n\\t\\tSenator Kennedy\\x92s delightful and very fine response to political \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions during his speech and after his analysis of the Watergate \\r\\n\\t\\tproblems, I stopped at a room on the way, while he had his press \\r\\n\\t\\tconference and I changed my speech notes. My own interest in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe criminal justice system is very deep and heartfelt. Not having \\r\\n\\t\\tstudied law, I\\x92ve had to learn the hard way. I read a lot and listen a \\r\\n\\t\\tlot. One of the sources for my understanding about the proper \\r\\n\\t\\tapplication of criminal justice and the system of equity is by readingReinhold Niebuhrfrom a book thatBill Guntergave me quite a number of \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago. The other source of my understanding about what\\x92s right and \\r\\n\\t\\twrong in this society is from a personal, very close friend of mine, a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat poet named Bob Dylan. After listening to his records about \\x93The \\r\\n\\t\\tBallad of Hattie Carol\\x94 and \\x93Like a Rolling Stone\\x94 and \\x93The Times, They \\r\\n\\t\\tAre a-Changing\\x94, I\\x92ve learned to appreciate the dynamism of change in a \\r\\n\\t\\tmodern society. I grew up as a \\r\\n\\t\\tlandowner\\x92s son. But I don\\x92t think I ever realized that the proper \\r\\n\\t\\tinterrelationship between the landowner and those who worked on a farm \\r\\n\\t\\tuntil I heard Dylan\\x92s record, \\x93I Ain\\x92t Gonna Work onMaggie\\x92s FarmNo More.\\x94 So I come here \\r\\n\\t\\tspeaking to you today about your subject with a base for -- for my own \\r\\n\\t\\tinformation founded on Reinhold Niebuhr and Bob Dylan. One of the things \\r\\n\\t\\tthat Niebuhr says is that the sad duty of the political system is to \\r\\n\\t\\testablish justice in a sinful world. And he goes on to say that there\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tno way to establish or maintain justice without law. That -- that the \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws are constantly changing to stabilize the social equilibrium of the \\r\\n\\t\\tforces and counter forces of a dynamic society and that the law in its \\r\\n\\t\\ttotality is an expression of the structure of government. Well, as a farmer who \\r\\n\\t\\thas now been in office for three years, I\\x92ve seen it first hand, the \\r\\n\\t\\tinadequacy of my own comprehension of what government ought to be for \\r\\n\\t\\tits people. And I\\x92ve had a constant learning process, sometimes from \\r\\n\\t\\tlawyers, sometimes from practical experience, sometimes from failures \\r\\n\\t\\tand mistakes that have been pointed out to me after they were made. I had lunch this week \\r\\n\\t\\twith the members of the Judicial Selection Committee and they were \\r\\n\\t\\ttalking about a consent search warrant. I said I didn\\x92t know what a \\r\\n\\t\\tconsent search warrant was. And they said, \\x93Well, that\\x92s when two \\r\\n\\t\\tpolicemen go to a house. One of them goes to the front door and knocks \\r\\n\\t\\ton it and the other one runs around to the back door and yells come in. \\r\\n\\t\\tSo, I have to admit that as Governor quite often I search for ways to \\r\\n\\t\\tbring about my own hope, not quite so stringently testing the law as \\r\\n\\t\\tthat but with a common motivation for that. Well, I would like to \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk to you for a few moments about some of the practical aspects of \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing a Governor who is still deeply concerned about the inadequacies of \\r\\n\\t\\ta system of which it\\x92s obvious that you are so patently proud. I have refrained \\r\\n\\t\\tcompletely from making any judicial appointment on the basis of \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical support or other factors, and have chosen in every instance \\r\\n\\t\\tSuperior Court judges, quite often state judges, all Appellate Court \\r\\n\\t\\tjudges, on the basis of merit analysis by a highly competent, open, \\r\\n\\t\\tqualified group of distinguished Georgians. And I\\x92m proud of it. We\\x92ve now established \\r\\n\\t\\tin the Georgia Constitution a Qualifications Commission which for the \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst time can hear complaints from average citizens about the \\r\\n\\t\\tperformance in office of -- of judges and can investigate those \\r\\n\\t\\tcomplaints and with the status and the force of the Georgia Constitution \\r\\n\\t\\tbehind them can remove a judge from office or take other corrective \\r\\n\\t\\tsteps. We have now passed a \\r\\n\\t\\tconstitutional amendment which is waiting for the citizenry to approve, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat establishes a uniform criminal justice court system in this state \\r\\n\\t\\tso that the affairs of the judiciary can be more orderly structured, so \\r\\n\\t\\tthat workloads can be balanced, and so that over a period of time there \\r\\n\\t\\tmight be an additional factor of equity, which quite often does not \\r\\n\\t\\texist now because of the wide disparity among the different courts of \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorgia. We passed this year a \\r\\n\\t\\tjudge sentencing bill for non-capital cases with a review procedure. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92ve had presented to me, by members of Pardon Parole Board, an analysis \\r\\n\\t\\tof some of the sentences given to people by the Superior Court judges of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis state, which grieved me deeply and shocked me as a layman. And I \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve that over a period of time, the fact that a group of other \\r\\n\\t\\tjudges can review and comment on the sentences meted out in the \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent portions of Georgia in the future will bring some more equity \\r\\n\\t\\tto this system. We have finally \\r\\n\\t\\teliminated theunsworn statement law in Georgia, the last state to do \\r\\n\\t\\tit. This year, we \\r\\n\\t\\tanalyzed in depth the structure of the drug penalties in this -- in this \\r\\n\\t\\tstate. And I believe that in the future there will be a clearer under -- \\r\\n\\t\\tclear understanding of the seriousness of different crimes relating to \\r\\n\\t\\tdrugs. We\\x92ve finally been able to get through the legislature a law that \\r\\n\\t\\tremoves alcoholism or drunkenness as an offense. And when this law goes \\r\\n\\t\\tinto effect next year, I think it will create a new sense of compassion \\r\\n\\t\\tand concern and justice for the roughly 150,000 alcoholics in Georgia, \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of whom escape the consequences of what has been a crime because of \\r\\n\\t\\tsome social or economic prominence, and will remove a very heavy load \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the criminal justice system. In our prisons, which \\r\\n\\t\\tin the past have been a disgrace to Georgia, we\\x92ve tried to make \\r\\n\\t\\tsubstantive changes in the quality of those who administer them and to \\r\\n\\t\\tput a new realm of understanding and hope and compassion into the \\r\\n\\t\\tadministration of that portion of the -- of the system of justice. \\r\\n\\t\\tNinety-five percent of those who are presently incarcerated in prisons \\r\\n\\t\\twill be returned to be our neighbors. And now the thrust of the entire \\r\\n\\t\\tprogram, as initiated under Ellis MacDougall and now continued under Dr. \\r\\n\\t\\tAult, is to try to discern in the soul of each convicted and sentenced \\r\\n\\t\\tperson redeeming features that can be enhanced. We plan a career for \\r\\n\\t\\tthat person to be pursued while -- while he\\x92s in prison. And I believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the early data that we have on recidivism rate indicates the \\r\\n\\t\\tefficacy of what we\\x92ve done. The GBI, which was \\r\\n\\t\\tformerly a matter of great concern to all those who were interested in \\r\\n\\t\\tlaw enforcement, has now been substantially changed for the better. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI would put it up now in quality against the FBI, the Secret Service, or \\r\\n\\t\\tany other crime control organization in this nation. Well, does that mean \\r\\n\\t\\tthat everything is all right? It -- it doesn\\x92t to \\r\\n\\t\\tme. And -- and I don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\texactly know how to say this, but -- but I just was thinking a few \\r\\n\\t\\tmoments ago about some of the things that\\x85could, that are of deep \\r\\n\\t\\tconcern to me as Governor. As a scientist, I was working constantly, \\r\\n\\t\\talong with almost everyone who professes that dedication of life, to -- \\r\\n\\t\\tto probe, probe, probe every day of my life for constant change for the \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter. It is completely anachronistic in the makeup of a nuclear \\r\\n\\t\\tphysicist or an engineer or scientist to be satisfied with what we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tgot, or to rest on the laurels of past accomplishments. It\\x92s -- it\\x92s the \\r\\n\\t\\tnature of the profession. As a farmer, the same \\r\\n\\t\\tmotivation persists. Every farmer that I know of, who\\x92s worth his salt \\r\\n\\t\\tor who\\x92s just average, is ahead of the experiment stations and the \\r\\n\\t\\tresearch agronomists in finding better ways, changing ways to plant, \\r\\n\\t\\tcultivate, utilize herbicides, gather, cure, sell farm products. The \\r\\n\\t\\tcompetition for innovation is tremendous, equivalent to the realm of \\r\\n\\t\\tnuclear physics even. In my opinion, it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent in the case of lawyers. And -- and maybe this is a \\r\\n\\t\\tcircumstance that is so inherently true that it can\\x92t be changed. I\\x92m a Sunday school \\r\\n\\t\\tteacher, and -- and I\\x92ve always known that the structure of law is \\r\\n\\t\\tfounded on the Christian ethic, you shall love the Lord your God and \\r\\n\\t\\tyour neighbor as yourself, a\\x85 very high and perfect standard. And we all \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that the fallibility of man and the contentions in society as \\r\\n\\t\\tdescribed by Reinhold Niebuhr and many others don\\x92t permit us to achieve \\r\\n\\t\\tperfection. We do strive for equality, but -- but not with a -- with a \\r\\n\\t\\tfervent and daily commitment of life. In general, the \\r\\n\\t\\tpowerful and the influential in our society shape the laws and have a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreat influence on the legislature on the Congress. And this creates a \\r\\n\\t\\treluctance to change because -- because the powerful and the influential \\r\\n\\t\\thave carved out for themselves or have inherited a privileged position \\r\\n\\t\\tin society of wealth or social prominence or higher education or \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity for the future. Quite often, those circumstances are \\r\\n\\t\\tcircumvented at a very early age because college students, particularly \\r\\n\\t\\tundergraduates, don\\x92t have any commitment to the tight preservation of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe way things are. But later, as their interrelationship with the \\r\\n\\t\\tpresent circumstances grow, they also are committed to approaching \\r\\n\\t\\tchange very, very slowly and very, very cautiously, and there\\x92s a \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitment to the status quo. I remember when I was \\r\\n\\t\\ta child. I lived on a farm about three miles from Plains, and we didn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\thave electricity or running water. We lived on the railroad, Seaboard \\r\\n\\t\\tCoastline Railroad. And I like all farm boys, I had a flip, a slingshot. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey had stabilized the railroad bed with little white round rocks, \\r\\n\\t\\twhich I used for ammunition. And I would go out frequently to the \\r\\n\\t\\trailroad and -- and gather the most perfectly shaped and the ones of \\r\\n\\t\\tproper size. And I always had a few in my pocket, and I had others \\r\\n\\t\\tcached away around the farm, so that they would be convenient if I ran \\r\\n\\t\\tout of my pocket supply. One day I was leaving \\r\\n\\t\\tthe railroad track with my pockets full of rocks and my hands full of \\r\\n\\t\\trocks, and my mother came out on the front porch. This is not a very \\r\\n\\t\\tinteresting story but it illustrates a point. And -- and she had in her \\r\\n\\t\\thands a plate of cookies that she had just baked for me. And she called \\r\\n\\t\\tme, I\\x92m sure with love in her heart and said, \\x93Jimmy, I\\x92ve -- I\\x92ve baked \\r\\n\\t\\tsome cookies for you.\\x94\\xa0 And I remember very distinctly walking up to her \\r\\n\\t\\tand standing there for 15 or 20 seconds, in honest doubt about whether I \\r\\n\\t\\tshould drop those rocks which were worthless and to take the cookies \\r\\n\\t\\tthat my mother had prepared for me, which between her and me were very \\r\\n\\t\\tvaluable. Well, quite often, we \\r\\n\\t\\t-- we have the same inclination in our -- in our everyday lives. And we \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t recognize that change can sometimes be very beneficial, although \\r\\n\\t\\twe -- we fear it. Anyone who lives in the South looks back on the last \\r\\n\\t\\t15 or 20 years with some degree of embarrassment, including myself. To \\r\\n\\t\\tthink about going back to a county unit system, which deliberately \\r\\n\\t\\tcheated for generation to generations certain\\xa0 voters of this, certain \\r\\n\\t\\twhite voters of this state is almost inconceivable. To revert back or to \\r\\n\\t\\tforego the one man, one vote principle, we would consider to be a \\r\\n\\t\\thorrible violation of the basic principles of justice and equality and \\r\\n\\t\\tfairness and equity. The first speech I \\r\\n\\t\\tever made in the Georgia Senate, representing the most conservative \\r\\n\\t\\tdistrict in Georgia, was concerning the abolition of a 30 questions that \\r\\n\\t\\twe had so proudly evolved as a subterfuge to keep black citizens from \\r\\n\\t\\tvoting and which we used with a great deal of smirking and\\x85 of pride for \\r\\n\\t\\tdecades or generations ever since the War Between the States. Questions \\r\\n\\t\\tthat nobody could answer in this room, but which were applied to every \\r\\n\\t\\tblack citizen that came to the Sumter County Courthouse or the Webster \\r\\n\\t\\tCounty Courthouse and said, \\x93I want to vote.\\x94 And I spoke in that \\r\\n\\t\\tchamber, fearful of the news media reporting it back home, but \\r\\n\\t\\toverwhelmed with a commitment then in favor of the abolition of that \\r\\n\\t\\tartificial barrier to the rights of an American citizen. I remember the \\r\\n\\t\\tthing that I used in my speech, that -- that a black pencil salesman on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe out -- outer door of the Sumter County Courthouse could make a \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter judgment about who ought to be sheriff than two highly educated \\r\\n\\t\\tprofessors at Georgia Southwestern College. Dr. Martin Luther \\r\\n\\t\\tKing, Jr., who was perhaps despised by many in this room because he \\r\\n\\t\\tshook up our social structure that benefited us, and demanded simply \\r\\n\\t\\tthat black citizens be treated the same as white citizens, wasn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tgreeted with approbation and accolades by the Georgia Bar Association or \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Alabama Bar Association. He was greeted with horror. And still, once \\r\\n\\t\\tthat change was made, a very simple but difficult change, no one in his \\r\\n\\t\\tright mind would want to go back to circumstances prior to that juncture \\r\\n\\t\\tin the development of our nation\\x92s society. I -- I don\\x92t want to \\r\\n\\t\\tgo on and on; I\\x92m -- I\\x92m part of it. But the point I want to make to you \\r\\n\\t\\tis that we still have a long way to go. In every age or every year, we \\r\\n\\t\\thave a tendency to believe that we\\x92ve come so far now, that there\\x92s no \\r\\n\\t\\tway to improve the present system. I\\x92m sure when the Wright Brothers \\r\\n\\t\\tflew at Kitty Hawk, they felt thatwas the ultimate in \\r\\n\\t\\ttransportation. And when the first atomic bomb was exploded, that was \\r\\n\\t\\tthe ultimate in the developments in nuclear physics, and so forth. Well, we haven\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\treached the ultimate. But who\\x92s going to search the heart and the soul \\r\\n\\t\\tof an organization like yours or a law school or a state or nation and \\r\\n\\t\\tsay, \\x93What can we still do to restore equity and justice or to preserve \\r\\n\\t\\tit or to enhance it in this society?\\x94 You know, I\\x92m not \\r\\n\\t\\tafraid to make a change. I don\\x92t have anything to lose. But as a farmer, \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92m not qualified to assess the characteristics of the ninety-one \\r\\n\\t\\thundred inmates in the Georgia prisons, 50 percent of whom ought not to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe there. They ought to be on probation or under some other supervision \\r\\n\\t\\tand assess what the results of previous court rulings might bring to \\r\\n\\t\\tbear on their lives. I was in the \\r\\n\\t\\tGovernor\\x92s mansion for two years, enjoying the services of a very fine \\r\\n\\t\\tcook, who was a prisoner, a woman. And one day she came to me, after she \\r\\n\\t\\tgot over her two years of timidity and said, \\x93Governor, I would like to \\r\\n\\t\\tborrow 250 dollars from you.\\x94 And I said, \\x93What could you possibly want \\r\\n\\t\\twith 250 dollars as a prisoner?\\x94 I said, \\x93I\\x92m not sure that a lawyer \\r\\n\\t\\twould be worth that much.\\x94 And she said, \\x93I don\\x92t want to hire a lawyer, \\r\\n\\t\\tI want to pay the judge.\\x94 And I thought it was \\r\\n\\t\\ta ridiculous statement for her. I felt that she was ignorant. But I \\r\\n\\t\\tfound out that she wasn\\x92t. She had been sentenced by a superior court \\r\\n\\t\\tjudge in the state, who still serves, to seven years or 750 dollars. And \\r\\n\\t\\tshe had finally raised, earlier in her prison career, 500 dollars. She \\r\\n\\t\\thad been in prison five years and couldn\\x92t raise the other 250 dollars. \\r\\n\\t\\tI didn\\x92t lend her the money, but I had Bill Harper, my legal secretary, \\r\\n\\t\\tlooked into it. And he found that the circumstances were true. And she \\r\\n\\t\\twas quickly released under a recent court ruling that had come down in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe last few years. I was down on the \\r\\n\\t\\tcoast this weekend. I was approached by a woman who asked me to come by \\r\\n\\t\\ther home. And I went by and she showed me documents that indicated that \\r\\n\\t\\ther illiterate mother, who had a son in jail, had gone to the County \\r\\n\\t\\tSurveyor in that region and had borrowed 225 dollars to get her son out \\r\\n\\t\\tof prison. She had a letter from the Justice of the Peace that showed \\r\\n\\t\\tthat her mother had made a mark on a blank sheet of paper. They paid off \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 225 dollars and she has the receipts to show it. And then they \\r\\n\\t\\tstarted a five year program trying to get back the paper she signed, \\r\\n\\t\\twithout success. They went to court. And the lawyer that had originally \\r\\n\\t\\tadvised her to sign the paper showed up as the attorney for the \\r\\n\\t\\tsurveyor. She had put up 50 -- 50 acres of land near the county seat as \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity. And when she got to court she found that instead of signing a \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity deed that she had signed a warranty deed. That case has already \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen appealed to the Supreme Court and she lost. Well, you know I \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t, I know that -- that the technicalities of the law that would \\r\\n\\t\\tpermit that are probably justifiable. She didn\\x92t have a good lawyer. But \\r\\n\\t\\tI, my -- my heart feels -- feels and cries out that something ought to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe analyzed, not just about the structure of government, judicial \\r\\n\\t\\tqualification councils, and judicial appointment committees and \\r\\n\\t\\teliminating the unsworn statement - those things are important. But they \\r\\n\\t\\tdon\\x92t reach the crux of the point, that I, that now we assign punishment \\r\\n\\t\\tto fit the criminal and not the crime. You can go in the \\r\\n\\t\\tprisons of Georgia, and -- and I don\\x92t know, it may be that -- that poor \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople are the only ones who commit crimes. I don\\x92t think so. But \\r\\n\\t\\tthey\\x92re the only ones that serve prison sentences. When Ellis MacDougall \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst went to Reidsville, he found people that had been in solitary \\r\\n\\t\\tconfinement for ten years. We now have 500 misdemeanants in the Georgia \\r\\n\\t\\tprison system. Well, I -- I don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tknow the theory of law, but there is one other point I want to make, \\r\\n\\t\\tjust for your own consideration. I believe we\\x92ve made great progress in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Pardon\\xa0 Parole Board since I\\x92ve been in office and since we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\treorganized the government. We have five very enlightened people there \\r\\n\\t\\tnow. And on occasion they go out to the prison system to interview the \\r\\n\\t\\tinmates, to decide whether or not they\\x92re worthy to be released after \\r\\n\\t\\tthey serve a third of their sentence. I think most jurors and most \\r\\n\\t\\tjudges feel that, when they give the sentence, they know that after a \\r\\n\\t\\tthird of the sentence has gone by, they will be eligible for careful \\r\\n\\t\\tconsideration. And -- and just think for a moment about your own son or \\r\\n\\t\\tyour own father or your own daughter being in prison, having served \\r\\n\\t\\tseven years of a life term and being considered for release. Don\\x92t you \\r\\n\\t\\tthink that they ought to be examined and that the Pardon and Parole \\r\\n\\t\\tBoard ought to look \\x91em in the eye and ask them a question and, if they \\r\\n\\t\\tare turned down, ought to give them some substantive reason that they\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tnot released and what they can do to correct their defect? I do. And I think it\\x92s just \\r\\n\\t\\tas important at that time for consideration of early release as it is \\r\\n\\t\\teven when they\\x92re sentenced. But, I don\\x92t know how to bring about that \\r\\n\\t\\tchange. We had an ethics bill \\r\\n\\t\\tin the state legislature this year. Half of it passed, to -- to require \\r\\n\\t\\tan accounting for contributions during a campaign, but the part that \\r\\n\\t\\tapplied to people after the campaign failed. We couldn\\x92t get it through \\r\\n\\t\\tto require the revelation of payments or gifts of officeholders -- to \\r\\n\\t\\tofficeholders after in office. And the largest force \\r\\n\\t\\t-- against that ethics bill were the lawyers. Some of you here \\r\\n\\t\\ttried to help get a consumer protection package passed without success. The regulatory \\r\\n\\t\\tagencies in Washington are made up, not of -- not of people to regulate \\r\\n\\t\\tindustries, but of representatives of the industries that are regulated. \\r\\n\\t\\tIs that fair and right and equitable? I don\\x92t think so. I\\x92m only going to \\r\\n\\t\\tserve four years as Governor, as you know. I think it\\x92s enough. I enjoy \\r\\n\\t\\tit, but I\\x85 think I\\x92ve done all I can in the Governor\\x92s office. I see the \\r\\n\\t\\tlobbyists in the\\x85 state capitol filling the halls on occasions. Good \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople -- competent people, the most pleasant, personable, \\r\\n\\t\\textroverted citizens of Georgia. Those are the characteristics that are \\r\\n\\t\\trequired for a lobbyist. And they represent good folk. But I tell you \\r\\n\\t\\tthat when a lobbyist goes to represent the Peanut Warehousemen\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tAssociation of the Southeast, which I belong to, which I helped to \\r\\n\\t\\torganize, they go there to represent the peanut warehouseman. They don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tgo there to represent the customers of the peanut warehouseman. And when the state \\r\\n\\t\\tChamber of Commerce lobbyists goes there, they go there to represent the \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinessman of Georgia. They don\\x92t go there to represent the customers \\r\\n\\t\\tof the businessmen of Georgia. And when your own organization is \\r\\n\\t\\tinterested in some legislation there at the capitol, they\\x92re interested \\r\\n\\t\\tin the welfare or prerogatives or authority of the lawyers. They\\x92re not \\r\\n\\t\\tthere to represent in any sort of extensive way the client of the \\r\\n\\t\\tlawyer. And the American \\r\\n\\t\\tMedical Association and its Georgia equivalent, they represent the \\r\\n\\t\\tdoctors, who are fine people. But they certainly don\\x92t represent the \\r\\n\\t\\tpatients of the doctors. Well, I do, you know, \\r\\n\\t\\tas -- as an elected Governor, I feel that responsibility; but I also \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that my qualifications are slight compared to the doctors or the \\r\\n\\t\\tlawyers or the teachers, to determine what\\x92s best for the client or the \\r\\n\\t\\tpatient or the schoolchild. Well, this bothers me \\r\\n\\t\\tand -- and I know that\\x85 if there was a commitment on the part of a \\r\\n\\t\\tcumulative group of attorneys in this state, to search with a degree of \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitment and fervency, to eliminate many of the inequities that I\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tjust described that I thought of this morning, our state could be \\r\\n\\t\\ttransformed in the attitude of its people toward the government.  Senator Kennedy \\r\\n\\t\\tdescribed the malaise that exists in this nation. And it does. In closing, I\\x92d like \\r\\n\\t\\tto just illustrate the point by something that came to mind this morning \\r\\n\\t\\twhen I was talking to Senator Kennedy about his trip to Russia. When I was about 12 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears old, I liked to read, and I had a school principal named Miss \\r\\n\\t\\tJulia Coleman who Judge Marshall knows. And she forced me pretty much to \\r\\n\\t\\tread, read, read classical books. And she would give me a gold star when \\r\\n\\t\\tI read ten and a silver star when I read five. And -- and one day \\r\\n\\t\\tshe called me in and she said, \\x93Jimmy, I think it\\x92s time for you to readWar and Peace.\\x94 And I -- and I was completely relieved because I \\r\\n\\t\\tthought it was a book about cowboys and Indians. And, I went to the \\r\\n\\t\\tlibrary and checked it out and it was fourteen hundred and fifteen pages \\r\\n\\t\\tthick, I think, written by Tolstoy, as you know, about Napoleon\\x92s entry \\r\\n\\t\\tinto Russia in the 1812-1815 era. He had never been defeated, and he was \\r\\n\\t\\tsure he could win, but he underestimated the severity of the Russian \\r\\n\\t\\twinter and the peasants\\x92 love for their land. And to make a long \\r\\n\\t\\tstory short, the next spring he retreated in defeat. And -- and the \\r\\n\\t\\tcourse of history was changed. It probably affected our own lives. And -- and the point \\r\\n\\t\\tof the book is, and what Tolstoy points out in the epilogue is, that he \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\x92t write the book about Napoleon or the Czar of Russia or even the \\r\\n\\t\\tgenerals, except in a rare occasion. He wrote it about the students and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe housewives and the barbers and the farmers and the privates in the \\r\\n\\t\\tarmy. And the point of the book is that the course of human events, even \\r\\n\\t\\tthe greatest historical events are controlled by the combined wisdom and \\r\\n\\t\\tcourage and commitment and discernment and unselfishness and compassion \\r\\n\\t\\tand love and idealism of the common ordinary people. And if that was \\r\\n\\t\\ttrue in the case of Russia where they had a czar or France where they \\r\\n\\t\\thad an emperor, how much more true is it in our own case where the \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitution charges us with a direct responsibility for to determine \\r\\n\\t\\twhat our government is and ought to be? Well, I\\x92ve read parts \\r\\n\\t\\tof the embarrassing transcripts, and I have seen the proud statement of \\r\\n\\t\\ta former attorney general, who protected his boss, and now brags on the \\r\\n\\t\\tfact that he tiptoed through a mine field and came out quote clean \\r\\n\\t\\tunquote. You know, I -- I can\\x92t -- I can\\x92t imagine somebody like Thomas \\r\\n\\t\\tJefferson tiptoeing through a mine field on the technicalities of the \\r\\n\\t\\tlaw, and then bragging about being clean afterwards. And I think our \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople demand more than that. And -- and I believe that -- that everyone \\r\\n\\t\\tin this room who is in a position of responsibility as a preserver of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe law in its purest possible form ought to remember the oath that \\r\\n\\t\\tThomas Jefferson took and others when they practically signed their own \\r\\n\\t\\tdeath warrant, writing the Declaration of Independence to preserve \\r\\n\\t\\tjustice and equity and freedom and fairness. And they pledged their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. Thank you very much.',\n",
       " 'President and Mrs. Obama, \\r\\n\\t\\tdistinguished guests, friends of my father, all of you: While a nation has lost agreat senator, my brothers and sisters and I have lost a loving father. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhen I was a kid, I couldn\\'t breathe. Growing up, I suffered from \\r\\n\\t\\tchronic and crippling asthma attacks, and the medications I had to give \\r\\n\\t\\tto me were very difficult, and gave me a throbbing headache, every night \\r\\n\\t\\tthat I had to use my bronchosol nebulizer. Now, obviously, I wish that \\r\\n\\t\\tI did not have to suffer those attacks and endure those headaches; nor \\r\\n\\t\\tdid I like having to grow up having a special non-allergenic, \\r\\n\\t\\tnon-smoking room reserved for me whenever we went on family vacations. But as I now realize years \\r\\n\\t\\tlater, while asthma may have posed a challenge to my physical health, it \\r\\n\\t\\tpropped up my emotional and mental health because it kept my father by \\r\\n\\t\\tmy bedside. My dad was always sure to be within reach of me. And the \\r\\n\\t\\tside effects of the medication meant that he was always holding a cold \\r\\n\\t\\twet towel on my forehead until I fell asleep again from my headache. As far as the special effort \\r\\n\\t\\tthat was made to ensure that I had a proper room to sleep in while we \\r\\n\\t\\twere on vacations as a family, this usually meant that I got the nicest \\r\\n\\t\\troom, and it also ensured that dad was my roommate. I couldn\\x92t have seen \\r\\n\\t\\tit at the time, but having asthma was like hitting the jackpot for a \\r\\n\\t\\tchild who craved his father\\x92s love and attention. When his light shined \\r\\n\\t\\ton me alone, there was no better feeling in all of the world. When dad was away, I often \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\x92t know when he would return. And as a young boy, I didn\\x92t know why \\r\\n\\t\\the wasn\\x92t around at Christmas time when Santa came to the house. And I \\r\\n\\t\\treally wondered why Santa had the same two moles on his face that my dad \\r\\n\\t\\thad, and in the same place as my dad. Even after I figured out that that \\r\\n\\t\\twas my dad, and the costume finally came off, he still remained to me a \\r\\n\\t\\tmagical figure. As a little kid, I didn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tlook like much of a sailor, but my dad thought otherwise. You see, in \\r\\n\\t\\tsailing there are rules as well, much like government -- tireless, \\r\\n\\t\\tmundane rules that will surely make you sea sick. The rule was four \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople on a boat to race -- just four. But my dad, of course, dug around \\r\\n\\t\\tuntil he found a rule around the rule. Sound familiar to you [who] \\r\\n\\t\\tserved with him in the Senate? Kids under 12 he found out, especially scrawny \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle redheads like me, could tag along. My dad found that rule that \\r\\n\\t\\tmeshed with his mission. He refused to leave me behind. He did that for \\r\\n\\t\\tall of those around the world who needed a special voice as well. When \\r\\n\\t\\twe raced in foul weather, there was lots of salt water and lots of salty \\r\\n\\t\\tlanguage. Those experiences not only broadened my vocabulary, sure, but \\r\\n\\t\\tthey also built my self-confidence. I saw a lot of his political \\r\\n\\t\\tphilosophy in those sail boat races. One thing I noticed was that on the \\r\\n\\t\\tboat, as in this country, there was a role for everybody, a place for \\r\\n\\t\\teverybody to contribute. Second, in the race, as in life, it didn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter how strong the forces against you were so long as you kept \\r\\n\\t\\tdriving forward. There was nothing to lose. Maybe you\\'d even come \\r\\n\\t\\tout a winner. My dad was never bowed. He \\r\\n\\t\\tnever gave up; and there was no quit in dad. And looking out in this \\r\\n\\t\\taudience, and looking out at the tremendous number of people who align \\r\\n\\t\\tthemselves along the roadways, coming up from the Cape throughout Boston \\r\\n\\t\\twhen we went around, who waited in line for hours to see his casket as \\r\\n\\t\\tthey came through theJFK Library, there\\x92s no doubt in my mind that my \\r\\n\\t\\tdad came out a winner. I want to thank all of you \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the amazing tribute that you\\x92ve given my father in the last several \\r\\n\\t\\tdays. And I want to say just as proud as I was to be a crew on his \\r\\n\\t\\tsailboat, I am forever grateful for the opportunity to have worked with \\r\\n\\t\\thim in the United States Congress as his colleague. I admit I used to hang onto \\r\\n\\t\\this t-shirt and his coat sleeve on the Capitol when I was just a little \\r\\n\\t\\tboy. So, when I got a chance to serve with him on Capitol Hill, all I \\r\\n\\t\\tneeded to do was set my compass to the principles of his life. My father and I were the \\r\\n\\t\\tprimary sponsors of theMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Actwhich was signed into law last year. This bill represented not only a \\r\\n\\t\\tlegal victory for 54 million Americans with mental illness who are being \\r\\n\\t\\tdenied equal health insurance, but as one of those 54 million Americans, \\r\\n\\t\\tI felt he was also fighting for me to help ease the burden of stigma and \\r\\n\\t\\tshame that accompanies treatment. I will really miss working \\r\\n\\t\\twith dad. I will miss my dad\\x92s wonderful sense of self-deprecating \\r\\n\\t\\thumor. When the far right made dad their poster child for their attack \\r\\n\\t\\tads, he used to say, \"We Kennedys sure bring out the best in people.\" And \\r\\n\\t\\twhen he first got elected, and my cousin Joe was a member of Congress, and \\r\\n\\t\\tI came to Congress, dad finally celebrated saying, \"Finally after all \\r\\n\\t\\tthese years when someone says \\'Who does that damn Kennedy think he is?\\' \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tthere\\x92s only a one in three chance they\\x92re talking about me.\" Most Americans will remember \\r\\n\\t\\tdad as a good and decent hard-charging senator. But to Teddy, Curran, \\r\\n\\t\\tCaroline, Kara and I, we will always remember him as a loving and \\r\\n\\t\\tdevoted father. And in the 1980 campaign, my dad often quoted Robert \\r\\n\\t\\tFrost at the conclusion of every stump speech to indicate that he had to \\r\\n\\t\\tgo onto another political event. He would paraphrase the line from theRoad Less Traveled: \"The woods are lovely, dark and deep, and I have \\r\\n\\t\\tpromises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I \\r\\n\\t\\tsleep.\" Well, dad, you\\x92ve kept that \\r\\n\\t\\tpromise both literally and figuratively to be yourbrother\\x92s keeper. \\r\\n\\t\\tNow, it\\x92s time for you to rest in peace. May your spirit live forever in \\r\\n\\t\\tour hearts, and asyou challenged us so many times before, may your \\r\\n\\t\\tdream for a better, more just America never die. I love you, dad, and \\r\\n\\t\\tyou will always live in my heart forever.',\n",

I remember how my dad would tell audiences years ago, \"I don\\'t mind not being President. I just mind that someone else is.\" There is much to say -- and much will be said -- about Ted Kennedy the statesman, the master of the legislative process and bipartisan compromise, workhorse of the Senate, beacon of social justice, and protector of the people. There is also much to say -- and much will be said -- about my father the man, the storyteller, the lover of costume parties, a practical joker, the accomplished painter.1 He was a lover of everything French: cheese, wine, and women. He was a mountain climber, navigator, skipper, tactician, airplane pilot, rodeo rider, ski jumper, dog lover, and all-around adventurer. Our family vacations left us all injured and exhausted. He -- He was a dinner table debater and devil\\'s advocate. He was an Irishman, and a proud member of the Democratic Party.  He was a devout Catholic whose faith helped him survive unbearable losses and whose teachings taught him that he had a moral obligation to help others in need. He was not perfect -- far from it. But my father believed in redemption and he never surrendered -- never stopped trying to right wrongs, be they the results of his own failings or of ours. But today I am simply compelled to remember Ted Kennedy as my father and my best friend. When I was 12 years old I was diagnosed with bone cancer and a few months after I lost my leg, there was a heavy snowfall over my childhood home outside of Washington D.C. And my father went to the garage to get the old Flexible Flyer and asked me if I wanted to go sledding down the steep driveway. And I was trying to get used to my new artificial leg, and the hill was covered with ice and snow, and it wasn\\'t easy for me to walk. And the hill was -- was very slick and as I struggled to walk, I...slipped and I...I fell on the ice and I...I started to cry. And I said, \"I...can\\'t do this.\" I...said, \"I\\'ll never be able to climb up that hill.\" And he lifted up me in his strong, gentle arms and said something I will never forget. He said, \"I know you can do it. There is nothing that you can\\'t do. We\\'re going to climb that hill together, even if it takes us all day.\" Sure enough, he held me around my waist and we slowly made it to the top. And, you know, at age 12 losing your leg pretty much seems like the end of the world, but as I climbed onto his back and we flew down the hill that day, I knew he was right. I knew I was going to be okay. You see, my father taught me that even our most profound losses are survivable, and that is -- it is what we do with that loss, our ability to transform it into a positive event, that is one of my father\\'s greatest lessons. He taught me that nothing is impossible.  And he just wasn\\'t talking about boating. My father admired perseverance. My father believed that to do a job effectively required a tremendous amount of time and effort. Dad instilled in me also the importance of history and biography. He loved Boston and the amazing writers, and philosophers, and politicians from Massachusetts. He took me and my cousins to theOld North Church, and toWalden Pond, and to the homes of Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne in the Berkshires. He thought that Massachusetts was the greatest place on earth. And he had letters from many of its former senators like Daniel Webster and John Quincy Adams hanging on his walls, inspired by things heroic. He was a civil [w]ar buff. When we were growing up he would pack us all into his car or rented camper, and we would travel around to all the great battlefields. I remember he would frequently meet with his friendShelby Footeat a particular site on the anniversary of a historic battle, just so he could appreciate better what the soldiers must have experienced on that day. He believed that in order to know what to do in the future, you had to understand the past. My father loved other old things. He loved his classic wooden schooner, the Mya. He loved lighthouses and his 1973 Pontiac convertible. My father taught me to treat everyone I meet, no matter what station in life, with the same dignity and respect. He could be discussing arm control with the President at 3:00 p.m. and meeting with a union carpenter for -- on fair wage legislation or a New Bedford fisherman on fisheries policy at 4:30. I once told him that he accidentally left some money -- I remember this when I was a little kid -- on the sink in our hotel room. And he replied \"Teddy, let me tell you something.\" Making all -- \"Making beds all day is back-breaking work. The woman who has to clean up after us today has a family to feed.\" And that\\'s just the kind of guy he was. He answered Uncle Joe\\'s call to patriotism, Uncle Jack\\'scall to public service, and Bobby\\'s determinationto seek a newer world. Unlike them, he lived to be a grandfather, and knowing what my cousins have been through I feel grateful that I have had my father as long as I did. He even taught me some of life\\'s harder lessons, such as how to like Republicans. He once told me, he said, \"Teddy, Republicans love this country just as much as I do.\" I think that he felt like he had something in common with his Republican counterparts: the vagaries of public opinion, the constant scrutiny of the press, the endless campaigning for the next election; but most of all, the incredible shared sacrifice that being in public life demands. He understood that -- the hardship that politics has on a family and the hard work and commitment that it requires. He often brought his Republican colleagues home for dinner, and he believed in developing personal relationships and honoring differences. And one of the wonderful experiences that I will remember today is how many of his Republican colleges are sitting here, right before him. That\\'s a true testament to the man. And he always told me that, \"Always be ready to compromise but never compromise on your principles.\" He was an idealist -- and a pragmatist. He was restless -- but patient. When he learned thata survey of Republican senatorsnamed him the Democratic legislator that they most wanted to work with, and that John McCain called him the single most effective member of the U.S. Senate, he was so proud -- because he considered the combination of accolades from your supporters and respect from your sometime political adversaries as one of the ultimate goals of a successful political life. At the end of his life, my dad returned home. He died at the place he loved more than any other: Cape Cod. The last months of my dad\\x92s life were not sad or terrifying, but filled with profound experiences, a series of moments more precious than I could have imagined. He taught me more about humility, vulnerability, and courage than he had taught me in my whole life. Although he lived a full and complete life by any measure, the fact is he wasn\\x92t done. He still had work to do. He was so proud of where we had recently come as a nation, and although I do grieve for what might have been, for what he might have helped us accomplish, I pray today that we can set aside this sadness and instead celebrate all that he was, and did, and stood for. I will try to live up to the high standard that my father...set for all of uswhen he said, \"The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\" I love you dad. I always will. And I miss you already.',\n",
       " 'My home used to be a place of comfort and safety for my family. It used \\r\\n\\t\\tto be what a home should be: a place of peace and protection from the \\r\\n\\t\\toutside world. That was taken from us -- and not just from my family but \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom every home and every citizen in Flint. Now my home is known as \"ground zero.\" The people in Flint now stand with the people in D.C. who sufferedtheir \\r\\n\\t\\town lead crisisa decade ago -- because we now know the horror of poison \\r\\n\\t\\trunning through our taps and the negligence of the agencies paid to \\r\\n\\t\\tprotect us. In 2014, in a city with no democracy, forced under an emergency manager handpicked byGovernor Snyder, a decision was made to switch the water source without \\r\\n\\t\\tthe proper testing and enforcement of regulation. TheMDEQ[Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] claims they \\r\\n\\t\\tmisinterpreted federal law regarding corrosion control. They were \\r\\n\\t\\tallowed to tellEPA[Environmental Protection Agency] they were following the law without any \\r\\n\\t\\tverifications. The citizens in Flint were assured for 18 months that the \\r\\n\\t\\twater was safe. My home was being tested because of the discoloration of my water and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe health issues my family was experiencing. We fought the city and the \\r\\n\\t\\tstate, saying there was something wrong, and we were dismissed. I decided we need[ed] to get to the science if anyone was ever going to \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve us. I started researching and educating myself about water. I \\r\\n\\t\\thad three tests done by the city of Flint, using extra steps that tend \\r\\n\\t\\tto minimize lead in water. Those numbers were: 104 parts per billion, 397 \\r\\n\\t\\tparts per billion, and 707 parts per billion. I contacted the EPA and started working with Miguel Del Toral and Jennifer \\r\\n\\t\\tCrooks at the EPA.\\xa0Mr. Del Toral was very thorough and \\r\\n\\t\\tknowledgeable in assisting me. I told Mr. Del Toral I did not believe \\r\\n\\t\\tthere was corrosion control in the water, provided him documentation \\r\\n\\t\\tabout this fact, and he verified my findings -- and he was furious. Mr. Del Toral questioned the MDEQ -- and at first they lied -- and then \\r\\n\\t\\tlater admitted the truth. I figured out that [Ms.] Crooks was aiding the MDEQ with her lies, and Mr. Del Toral was the only one willing to \\r\\n\\t\\taddress the problem.\\r\\n\\t\\tI requested a copy of Mr. Del Toral\\'s report, and I made it public \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause people had a right to know. With the report public, Susan Hedman, EPA, \\r\\n\\t\\tapologized to the Mayor of Flint and to the MDEQ -- because of policy. No one but Mr. Del Toral was willing to do their job. Mr. Del Toral was \\r\\n\\t\\ttold by the ethics attorney to forward all media requests, including \\r\\n\\t\\tthose during his personal time. He was also advised not to talk about -- \\r\\n\\t\\tabout Flint, or to anyone from Flint.\\r\\n\\t\\tIn a meeting I had with MDEQ, Liane Schekter Smith bragged to me about \\r\\n\\t\\thow Mr. Del Toral had been \"handled,\" that his report was flawed, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthat there would be no final report. This was the ultimate betrayal for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe citizens. Susan Hedman cared more about policy than the welfare of \\r\\n\\t\\tan entire community, while punishing and silencing the one person that \\r\\n\\t\\twas willing to help us. I started doing independent testing with Virginia Tech, and 30 tests \\r\\n\\t\\twere done -- tests that were performed in accordance to theLCR[Lead and Copper Rule]. My \\r\\n\\t\\taverage was 2500 parts per billion. My highest was 13,500 parts per \\r\\n\\t\\tbillion.\\xa0 Hazardous waste is 5,000. Regardless of this information \\r\\n\\t\\tand the fact that my son had lead poisoning, the city and theMDEQstill continued to tell everyone the \\r\\n\\t\\twater was safe, as theEPAsat by and watched \\r\\n\\t\\tin silence. Because the state and federal governments failed us, with the help of \\r\\n\\t\\tVirginia Tech, we conducted citizen-based samplings.1We educated and distributed 300 samples equally throughout the city. We \\r\\n\\t\\tcollected back 277 samples. All of this was done in a three week \\r\\n\\t\\tturnaround. Here are the facts. After the tragedy in D.C., from 2001 to 2006, where \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren were poisoned by lead and water, the EPA should have \\r\\n\\t\\timmediately closed the loopholes to protect all citizens. Had the EPA \\r\\n\\t\\tclosed the loopholes, then it could have 100% prevented what just took \\r\\n\\t\\tplace in Flint. EPA has failed to protect people by refusing to ban \\r\\n\\t\\tpartial lead service line replacements.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe EPA\\'s LCR [Lead and Copper Rule] national \\r\\n\\t\\treport from 2006 states that the \"lack of system response\" for lead \"exceedances\" \\r\\n\\t\\tis \"especially true...to inform the public.\" It is done \"less than one \\r\\n\\t\\tthird of the time.\"2 From my research I have found that this is not a Flint problem or a rare \\r\\n\\t\\tanomaly. This is a national problem. Only 10 states test accurately and \\r\\n\\t\\taccording to the LCR. Twenty-one states do not reveal their sampling \\r\\n\\t\\tinstructions. And 19 states have testing similar to loopholes to the \\r\\n\\t\\tMichigan ones. There is no justifiable reason for testing with loopholes -- except to \\r\\n\\t\\thide lead. These loopholes that need to be eliminated are: preflush, \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall mouth bottles, and cap on stagnation. I spoke againsttheNDWAC[National Drinking Water Advisory \\r\\n\\t\\tCouncil] recommendations that we -- that are now currently under \\r\\n\\t\\tadvisement by the EPA to change the LCR. These recommendations will \\r\\n\\t\\tweaken an already broken system, and I\\'m outraged that the EPA continues \\r\\n\\t\\tto allow this type of dishonesty with testing to continue nationally. The citizens in Flint are relying on each of you because we have no \\r\\n\\t\\tchoice. We trust no one but Virginia Tech. There are people in Flint \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday still not being assisted during this crisis: illegal \\r\\n\\t\\timmigrants, disabled, and shut-ins. Broken policy and procedures are \\r\\n\\t\\tsmothering the outcry of entire communities suffering financially, \\r\\n\\t\\tphysically, mentally, and emotionally. I urge you to help restore some of the trust lost and protect all the \\r\\n\\t\\tcitizens in the United States by never allowing this to happen again. We need this to happen now -- not 10 years from now. Thank you.',\n",
       " ' Let me start by thanking the Council\\x92s president,Joachim Rücker, for \\r\\n\\t\\tconvening this session. I appreciate the opportunity to be here at such \\r\\n\\t\\tan important time -- not only for the future of this body, but for human \\r\\n\\t\\trights around the globe. President Obama believes deeply in the mission of theHuman Rights \\r\\n\\t\\tCounciland recognizes the importance of U.S. engagement and leadership \\r\\n\\t\\twithin the organization. He made the decision to re-engage shortly after \\r\\n\\t\\the became President because he knew it is vital for the United States -- \\r\\n\\t\\tand for our allies --to have a seat at the table as the HRC sets its \\r\\n\\t\\tpriorities and implements its agenda. The moral standard that summons us here and unites us in common action \\r\\n\\t\\tdoes not belong to any one nation -- or continent. The fundamental \\r\\n\\t\\tstruggle for dignity has been a driving force in all of human history -- \\r\\n\\t\\tworldwide. And what drives us are a set of universal values and \\r\\n\\t\\taspirations. We in America know well that even in our own journey, there \\r\\n\\t\\tis still more work to be done. We also know that it is because of the \\r\\n\\t\\tcourage and commitment of citizens in each generation that the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates has come closer to living up to its founding ideals. Our journey \\r\\n\\t\\thas not been without great difficulty or, at times, contradiction. But I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink we can fairly say that we have dared to discuss these challenges \\r\\n\\t\\topenly, and hold ourselves accountable, including through our free press \\r\\n\\t\\tand unyielding commitment to protecting freedom of expression. And even as we acknowledge the challenges of our history and those we \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinue to face today, I don\\x92t think there\\x92s any other country in the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld that has worked harder to expand human rights than the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates of America. We are very proud of that. President Obama and I support the HRC for a simple reason: We believe in \\r\\n\\t\\tits mission and its possibilities. We know that, at its best, this Council can be a valuable means for \\r\\n\\t\\treminding every nation of its commitments and obligations, and holding \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries accountable when they fail to meet international standards. It can help countries to respond successfully to domestic human rights \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenges -- as we\\x92ve seen firsthand in Cote d\\x92Ivoire and elsewhere -- \\r\\n\\t\\tand advance global norms on issues like LGBT rights. It provides a means for self-evaluation on the part of individual \\r\\n\\t\\tnations, including through the Universal Periodic Review Process. And we \\r\\n\\t\\thave seen this type of self-examination and engagement with the \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational community produce real progress on the ground. And, of course, the HRC can play a critical role in shaping the global \\r\\n\\t\\tresponse to situations where human rights violations have reached levels \\r\\n\\t\\tthat stagger the imagination and shock the conscience -- and sadly, that \\r\\n\\t\\tis the case in far too many countries today. In parts of the Middle East and Africa, violent extremists have made it \\r\\n\\t\\tclear that -- not only do they have zero regard for human rights -- they \\r\\n\\t\\thave zero regard for human life, period. We\\x92ve seen groups like Daesh \\r\\n\\t\\tburn human beings alive; barbarically behead prisoners; sell girls into \\r\\n\\t\\tslavery; and execute widely and indiscriminately. Recently, the UN \\r\\n\\t\\treported the horrifying ways that Daesh treats even its most vulnerable \\r\\n\\t\\tcaptives -- crucifying children. Burying children alive. Hand-picking \\r\\n\\t\\tmentally challenged children to serve as suicide bombers and kill even \\r\\n\\t\\tmore innocent people.\\xa0\\xa0 Almost every week brings new examples how far \\r\\n\\t\\tthe evil of these groups reaches. But we also know that the best antidote to violent extremism is to keep \\r\\n\\t\\topen avenues for non-violent dissent, and that our best ally is civil \\r\\n\\t\\tsociety, the activists, journalists, community organizers, and critical \\r\\n\\t\\tthinkers who reject extreme ideologies, while showing people a way to \\r\\n\\t\\texpress hopes -- and grievances -- peacefully. So it is especially troubling that so many people in so many places are \\r\\n\\t\\tfacing grotesque restrictions on their freedoms and rights from their \\r\\n\\t\\town governments -- including, in some cases, their right to life. In Syria, those who escape the horrific attacks of extremist thugs do so \\r\\n\\t\\tonly to face a brutal dictator, who gases his own people, starves them \\r\\n\\t\\tas a weapon of war, and continues to barrage them barrel bombs that fall \\r\\n\\t\\ton their schools, hospitals, and mosques. Anyone who has seen the images \\r\\n\\t\\twill never forget them -- maimed bodies, people with their eyes gouged \\r\\n\\t\\tout, emaciated prisoners -- it defies any sense of humanity. In North Korea, tens of thousands of people live as virtual slaves. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere is no freedom of expression, worship, or political dissent. \\xa0Kim \\r\\n\\t\\tJong Un executes those who disagree with him -- purging his country of \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone he knows or imagines to be disloyal. For decades, the government \\r\\n\\t\\thas subjugated its citizens -- starving them, torturing them, \\r\\n\\t\\tincarcerating them -- or worse. Hundreds of thousands have lost their \\r\\n\\t\\tlives. And then there\\x92s the crisis in Ukraine. And here I urge the Council: \\r\\n\\t\\tLook at the facts. Do not allow yourselves to be misled. In Crimea and \\r\\n\\t\\tin the separatist-controlled areas of Eastern Ukraine, men, women, and \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren are being killed. They are being tortured. They are being raped \\r\\n\\t\\tand sexually assaulted. Detained arbitrarily. Abducted for ransom. \\r\\n\\t\\tForced into labor. Persecuted because of who they are and where they \\r\\n\\t\\tworship. This is what\\x92s happening. And it\\x92s up to the HRC to shine a \\r\\n\\t\\tlight on it, and do all we can to ensure it stops. The bottom line is that too many people, in too many places, are facing \\r\\n\\t\\tunbearable realities. We cannot accept that, and we do not accept that. And this Council -- \\r\\n\\t\\tworking with governments across the globe -- can help to create a future \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch brighter than the present or past. We are already making important -- even historic -- gains. And I\\x92m proud \\r\\n\\t\\tto say that since 2009, the United States has worked hard with you to \\r\\n\\t\\tachieve those gains. Consider the unprecedented resolutions this Council has passed to \\r\\n\\t\\trespond to threats facing civil society, to better protect the human \\r\\n\\t\\trights of LGBT persons, and to promote freedom of religion and freedom \\r\\n\\t\\tof expression, including through resolution 16/18. Consider the indispensable role the HRC has played in encouraging \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders to live up to their promises and commitments in countries such \\r\\n\\t\\tas Burma and Sri Lanka, where there are opportunities for real change. Consider the mountain of evidence we\\x92ve compiled, detailing horrific \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights abuses by government forces and terrorists in Syria. The \\r\\n\\t\\twheels of justice may not turn as rapidly as we would like, but the \\r\\n\\t\\tfoundation for establishing justice is being prepared. Consider how the Commission of Inquiry created by this Council changed \\r\\n\\t\\tthe conversation regarding the DPRK\\x92s appalling record on human rights. \\r\\n\\t\\tAs a result of the COI\\x92s conclusions, the Security Council put the DPRK \\r\\n\\t\\ton its agenda -- a clear condemnation of what\\x92s happening in the country, \\r\\n\\t\\tand an important acknowledgement of the link between human rights and \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational security and peace. And consider the great work of the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in \\r\\n\\t\\tIran, which spotlighted violations there. Make no mistake: these are significant accomplishments. The more the \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational community understands about specific human rights \\r\\n\\t\\tviolations, the greater the pressure will be on bad actors to change \\r\\n\\t\\tcourse. And eventually -- not always overnight, but eventually -- that \\r\\n\\t\\tpressure often translates into the kind of change that saves lives and \\r\\n\\t\\texpands freedom. My government believes that together, we can continue to make progress \\r\\n\\t\\tand help this body fulfill its mandate to make the world a better, safer \\r\\n\\t\\tplace. But for that to happen, we have to get serious about addressing our \\r\\n\\t\\troadblocks to progress. And the most obvious roadblock is self-imposed. I\\x92m talking, of course, about the HRC\\x92s deeply concerning record on \\r\\n\\t\\tIsrael. No one in this room can deny that there is an unbalanced focus \\r\\n\\t\\ton that one democratic country. No other nation has an entire agenda \\r\\n\\t\\titem set aside to deal with it. Year after year, there are five or six \\r\\n\\t\\tseparate resolutions on Israel. This year, there is a resolution \\r\\n\\t\\tsponsored by President Asad concerning the Golan. How, I ask, is that a \\r\\n\\t\\tsensible priority at the very moment when refugees from Syria are \\r\\n\\t\\tflooding into the Golan to escape Asad\\x92s murderous rule and receive \\r\\n\\t\\ttreatment from Israeli physicians? It must be said -- the HRC\\x92s obsession with Israel actually risks \\r\\n\\t\\tundermining the credibility of the entire organization. It has the \\r\\n\\t\\tpotential to limit the good we can accomplish. No one should doubt for a \\r\\n\\t\\tsecond that the United States will oppose any effort by any group or \\r\\n\\t\\tparticipant in the UN system to delegitimize or isolate Israel -- not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust in the HRC, but wherever it occurs. When it comes to human rights, \\r\\n\\t\\tno country on Earth should be free from scrutiny -- but neither should \\r\\n\\t\\tany country be subject to unfair and unfounded bias. The United States remains committed to this important mission, and we \\r\\n\\t\\tcertainly intend to remain involved in the HRC, which is why we are \\r\\n\\t\\trunning for reelection. When the stakes are as high as they are today -- when people in every \\r\\n\\t\\tcorner of the globe are denied rights they deserve -- the HRC must live \\r\\n\\t\\tup to the standards upon which it was created. Together we must be a \\r\\n\\t\\tvoice for those who are silenced by their leaders -- a ray of light for \\r\\n\\t\\tthose who spend their days locked away, without cause, in dark, dank \\r\\n\\t\\tcells -- a source of hope for those who fear their suffering may never \\r\\n\\t\\tend. This is the kind of organization the world desperately needs. And \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s the kind of organization that will help all of our nations live up \\r\\n\\t\\tto the ideals we share. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Thank you all very much. \\r\\n\\t\\tTonight, I have a privilege given few Americans \\x97 the privilege of \\r\\n\\t\\taccepting our party\\x92s nomination for President of the United States. And \\r\\n\\t\\tI accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence. In my life, no success has \\r\\n\\t\\tcome without a good fight, and this nomination wasn\\x92t any different. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\x92s a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey\\x92re leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to \\r\\n\\t\\tlead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won\\x92t forget. I\\x92m grateful to the \\r\\n\\t\\tPresident for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack \\r\\n\\t\\ton American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack \\r\\n\\t\\tmany thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model \\r\\n\\t\\tof grace and kindness in public and in private. And I\\x92m grateful to the \\r\\n\\t\\t41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding \\r\\n\\t\\texample of honorable service to our country. As always, I\\x92m indebted to \\r\\n\\t\\tmy wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can \\r\\n\\t\\tseem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness. But I have treasured them all the more, and can\\x92t imagine a \\r\\n\\t\\tlife without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things \\r\\n\\t\\tabout me tonight. But, in truth, she\\x92s more my inspiration than I am \\r\\n\\t\\thers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are \\x97 victims of land \\r\\n\\t\\tmines, children born in poverty and with birth defects \\x97 shows the \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady. When I was growing up, my \\r\\n\\t\\tfather was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and \\r\\n\\t\\tme would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of \\r\\n\\t\\tlife, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we \\r\\n\\t\\tare all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry. I wouldn\\x92t be here tonight but for the strength of her \\r\\n\\t\\tcharacter. My heartfelt thanks to all \\r\\n\\t\\tof you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds \\r\\n\\t\\twere long. I won\\x92t let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who \\r\\n\\t\\tto vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win \\r\\n\\t\\tyour trust. I intend to earn it. Finally, a word to Senator \\r\\n\\t\\tObama and his supporters. We\\x92ll go at it over the next two months. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\x92s the nature of these contests, and there are big differences \\r\\n\\t\\tbetween us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans, an association that means more to me than any other. We\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tdedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and \\r\\n\\t\\tendowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreater cause than that. And I wouldn\\x92t be an American worthy of the \\r\\n\\t\\tname if I didn\\x92t honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their \\r\\n\\t\\tachievement. But let there be no doubt, \\r\\n\\t\\tmy friends, we\\x92re going to win this election. And after we\\x92ve won, we\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government \\r\\n\\t\\tstart working for you again, and get this country back on the road to \\r\\n\\t\\tprosperity and peace. These are tough times for \\r\\n\\t\\tmany of you. You\\x92re worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, \\r\\n\\t\\tand are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All \\r\\n\\t\\tyou ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd that\\x92s just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for \\r\\n\\t\\tyour future. And I\\x92ve found just the \\r\\n\\t\\tright partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of \\r\\n\\t\\tAlaska. She has executive experience and a real record of \\r\\n\\t\\taccomplishment. She\\x92s tackled tough problems like energy independence \\r\\n\\t\\tand corruption. She\\x92s balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the \\r\\n\\t\\tspecial interests. She\\x92s reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She\\x92s the \\r\\n\\t\\tmother of five children. She\\x92s helped run a small business, worked with \\r\\n\\t\\ther hands and knows what it\\x92s like to worry about mortgage payments and \\r\\n\\t\\thealth care and the cost of gasoline and groceries. She knows where she comes \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what\\x92s right, \\r\\n\\t\\tand she doesn\\x92t let anyone tell her to sit down. I\\x92m very proud to have \\r\\n\\t\\tintroduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can\\x92t wait \\r\\n\\t\\tuntil I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning \\r\\n\\t\\tto the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington crowd: change is coming. I\\x92m not in the habit of \\r\\n\\t\\tbreaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when \\r\\n\\t\\twe tell you we\\x92re going to change Washington, and stop leaving our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry\\x92s problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count \\r\\n\\t\\ton it. We\\x92ve got a record of doing just that, and the strength, \\r\\n\\t\\texperience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you. You know, I\\x92ve been called a \\r\\n\\t\\tmaverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s meant as a compliment and sometimes it\\x92s not. What it really means \\r\\n\\t\\tis I understand who I work for. I don\\x92t work for a party. I don\\x92t work \\r\\n\\t\\tfor a special interest. I don\\x92t work for myself. I work for you. I\\x92ve fought corruption, and \\r\\n\\t\\tit didn\\x92t matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They \\r\\n\\t\\tviolated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I\\x92ve fought \\r\\n\\t\\tbig spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither \\r\\n\\t\\tneed nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank \\r\\n\\t\\tand make your mortgage payment. I\\x92ve fought to get million dollar checks \\r\\n\\t\\tout of our elections. I\\x92ve fought lobbyists who stole from Indian \\r\\n\\t\\ttribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco \\r\\n\\t\\tcompanies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses. I fought for the right \\r\\n\\t\\tstrategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn\\x92t a popular thing to do. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I\\x92d rather \\r\\n\\t\\tlose an election than see my country lose a war. Thanks to the leadership of \\r\\n\\t\\ta brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has \\r\\n\\t\\tthe honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a \\r\\n\\t\\tdefeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and \\r\\n\\t\\tthreatened the security of all Americans. I don\\x92t mind a good fight. \\r\\n\\t\\tFor reasons known only to God, I\\x92ve had quite a few tough ones in my \\r\\n\\t\\tlife. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it \\r\\n\\t\\tmatters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test. I fight for Americans. I \\r\\n\\t\\tfight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, \\r\\n\\t\\tMichigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing \\r\\n\\t\\tmarket. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven \\r\\n\\t\\tmonths. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills. I fight for Jake and Toni \\r\\n\\t\\tWimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; \\r\\n\\t\\tcoaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically \\r\\n\\t\\tdisabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master\\x92s Degree. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. \\r\\n\\t\\tTheir lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter to me. I fight for the family of \\r\\n\\t\\tMatthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country \\r\\n\\t\\tin Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to \\r\\n\\t\\thonor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well \\r\\n\\t\\tand never returned to, remains safe from its enemies. I fight to restore the pride \\r\\n\\t\\tand principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and \\r\\n\\t\\twe let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people \\r\\n\\t\\twhen some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it \\r\\n\\t\\tbigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a \\r\\n\\t\\tdangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tpassed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their \\r\\n\\t\\ttrust, when we valued our power over our principles. We\\x92re going to change that. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\x92re going to recover the people\\x92s trust by standing up again for the \\r\\n\\t\\tvalues Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing to get back to basics. We believe everyone has \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their \\r\\n\\t\\tGod-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the \\r\\n\\t\\tMayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We\\x92re all God\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren and we\\x92re all Americans. We believe in low taxes; \\r\\n\\t\\tspending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work \\r\\n\\t\\tand risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor. We believe in a strong \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal \\r\\n\\t\\tresponsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice \\r\\n\\t\\timpartially and don\\x92t legislate from the bench. We believe in the values \\r\\n\\t\\tof families, neighborhoods and communities. We believe in a government \\r\\n\\t\\tthat unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government \\r\\n\\t\\tthat doesn\\x92t make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have \\r\\n\\t\\tmore choices to make for yourself. I will keep taxes low and \\r\\n\\t\\tcut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new \\r\\n\\t\\tmarkets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will \\r\\n\\t\\tcut government spending. He will increase it. My tax cuts will create \\r\\n\\t\\tjobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will \\r\\n\\t\\tmake it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care \\r\\n\\t\\tinsurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce \\r\\n\\t\\twages, and force families into a government run health care system where \\r\\n\\t\\ta bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor. Keeping taxes low helps \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from \\r\\n\\t\\t$3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. \\r\\n\\t\\tReducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let \\r\\n\\t\\tyou keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see \\r\\n\\t\\tfit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world \\r\\n\\t\\teconomy is essential to our future prosperity. I know some of you have been \\r\\n\\t\\tleft behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government \\r\\n\\t\\thasn\\x92t even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was \\r\\n\\t\\tdesigned for the economy of the 1950s. That\\x92s going to change on my \\r\\n\\t\\twatch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the \\r\\n\\t\\tglobal economy. We\\x92re going to help workers who\\x92ve lost a job that won\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tcome back, find a new one that won\\x92t go away. We will prepare them for the \\r\\n\\t\\tjobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people \\r\\n\\t\\tfor new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries \\r\\n\\t\\tthat have been hard hit, we\\x92ll help make up part of the difference in \\r\\n\\t\\twages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they \\r\\n\\t\\treceive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a \\r\\n\\t\\tdecent wage. Education is the civil \\r\\n\\t\\trights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been \\r\\n\\t\\tgained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to \\r\\n\\t\\tshake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents \\r\\n\\t\\twith choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and \\r\\n\\t\\treward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work. When a public school fails \\r\\n\\t\\tto meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the \\r\\n\\t\\teducation of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may \\r\\n\\t\\tchoose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will \\r\\n\\t\\tchoose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren will have that opportunity. Senator Obama wants our \\r\\n\\t\\tschools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools \\r\\n\\t\\tto answer to parents and students. And when I\\x92m President, they will. My fellow Americans, when \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92m President, we\\x92re going to embark on the most ambitious national \\r\\n\\t\\tproject in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries that don\\x92t like us very much. We will attack the problem on \\r\\n\\t\\tevery front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new \\r\\n\\t\\twells offshore, and we\\x92ll drill them now. We will build more nuclear \\r\\n\\t\\tpower plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase \\r\\n\\t\\tthe use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the \\r\\n\\t\\tdevelopment and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles. Senator Obama thinks we can \\r\\n\\t\\tachieve energy independence without more drilling and without more \\r\\n\\t\\tnuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all \\r\\n\\t\\tresources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of \\r\\n\\t\\tour planet. It\\x92s an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by \\r\\n\\t\\tnature, and we have faced greater challenges. It\\x92s time for us to show \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world again how Americans lead. This great national cause \\r\\n\\t\\twill create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the \\r\\n\\t\\tengine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren enter the workforce. Today, the prospect of a \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to \\r\\n\\t\\tpeace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before \\r\\n\\t\\tus did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve. We have dealt a serious blow \\r\\n\\t\\tto al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they\\x92ll \\r\\n\\t\\tstrike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of \\r\\n\\t\\tterrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tleaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They \\r\\n\\t\\tinvaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld\\x92s oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their \\r\\n\\t\\tambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of \\r\\n\\t\\tGeorgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to \\r\\n\\t\\testablish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the \\r\\n\\t\\tCold War. But we can\\x92t turn a blind eye to aggression and international \\r\\n\\t\\tlawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity of the American people. We face many threats in this \\r\\n\\t\\tdangerous world, but I\\x92m not afraid of them. I\\x92m prepared for them. I \\r\\n\\t\\tknow how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and \\r\\n\\t\\twhat it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of \\r\\n\\t\\ta freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those \\r\\n\\t\\twho don\\x92t. I know how to secure the peace. When I was five years old, a \\r\\n\\t\\tcar pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the \\r\\n\\t\\twindow, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl \\r\\n\\t\\tHarbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came \\r\\n\\t\\thome from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and \\r\\n\\t\\tdied the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of \\r\\n\\t\\tmy life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It \\r\\n\\t\\tis terrible beyond imagination. I\\x92m running for President to \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my \\r\\n\\t\\texperience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our \\r\\n\\t\\tdisposal \\x97 diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals \\x97 \\r\\n\\t\\tto build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace. In America, we change things \\r\\n\\t\\tthat need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our \\r\\n\\t\\tgreatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tneed to search for it. We need to change the way \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment does almost everything: from the way we protect our security \\r\\n\\t\\tto the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to \\r\\n\\t\\tdisasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we \\r\\n\\t\\ttrain our workers to the way we educate our children. All these \\r\\n\\t\\tfunctions of government were designed before the rise of the global \\r\\n\\t\\teconomy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold \\r\\n\\t\\tWar. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness in Washington. The constant partisan rancor \\r\\n\\t\\tthat stops us from solving these problems isn\\x92t a cause, it\\x92s a symptom. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\x92s what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves \\r\\n\\t\\tand not you. Again and again, I\\x92ve worked \\r\\n\\t\\twith members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. \\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\x92s how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to \\r\\n\\t\\tanyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not. Instead of rejecting good \\r\\n\\t\\tideas because we didn\\x92t think of them first, let\\x92s use the best ideas \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let\\x92s try \\r\\n\\t\\tsharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I \\r\\n\\t\\twill ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my \\r\\n\\t\\tadministration will set a new standard for transparency and \\r\\n\\t\\taccountability. We\\x92re going to finally start \\r\\n\\t\\tgetting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tcare who gets the credit. I\\x92ve been an imperfect \\r\\n\\t\\tservant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, \\r\\n\\t\\tlast and always. And I\\x92ve never lived a day, in good times or bad, that \\r\\n\\t\\tI didn\\x92t thank God for the privilege. Long ago, something unusual \\r\\n\\t\\thappened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was \\r\\n\\t\\tblessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I \\r\\n\\t\\tserved in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of \\r\\n\\t\\tcourage, compassion and love. On an October morning, in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I \\r\\n\\t\\thadn\\x92t any worry I wouldn\\x92t come back safe and sound. I thought I was \\r\\n\\t\\ttougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend \\r\\n\\t\\ta few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for \\r\\n\\t\\tmy own pleasure; my own pride. I didn\\x92t think there was a cause more \\r\\n\\t\\timportant than me. Then I found myself falling \\r\\n\\t\\ttoward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken \\r\\n\\t\\tarms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped \\r\\n\\t\\tin a dark cell, and left to die. I didn\\x92t feel so tough anymore. When \\r\\n\\t\\tthey discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. \\r\\n\\t\\tThey couldn\\x92t set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhen I didn\\x92t get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they \\r\\n\\t\\tput me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn\\x92t do anything. I \\r\\n\\t\\tcouldn\\x92t even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn \\r\\n\\t\\tthe limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life. I was in solitary \\r\\n\\t\\tconfinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went \\r\\n\\t\\thome, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. \\r\\n\\t\\tOur Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthere were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, \\r\\n\\t\\tthough. I wasn\\x92t in great shape, and I missed everything about America. \\r\\n\\t\\tBut I turned it down. A lot of prisoners had it \\r\\n\\t\\tworse than I did. I\\x92d been mistreated before, but not as badly as \\r\\n\\t\\tothers. I always liked to strut a little after I\\x92d been roughed up to \\r\\n\\t\\tshow the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned \\r\\n\\t\\tdown their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. \\r\\n\\t\\tFor a long time. And they broke me. When they brought me back to \\r\\n\\t\\tmy cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn\\x92t know how I could face my \\r\\n\\t\\tfellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob \\r\\n\\t\\tCraner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard \\r\\n\\t\\tas I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get \\r\\n\\t\\tback up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor \\r\\n\\t\\tto serve with. Because every day they fought for me. I fell in love with my \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry when I was a prisoner in someone else\\x92s. I loved it not just for \\r\\n\\t\\tthe many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its \\r\\n\\t\\tfaith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting \\r\\n\\t\\tfor. I was never the same again. I wasn\\x92t my own man anymore. I was my \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry\\x92s. I\\x92m not running for \\r\\n\\t\\tpresident because I think I\\x92m blessed with such personal greatness that \\r\\n\\t\\thistory has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I \\r\\n\\t\\twill fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God. If you find faults with our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry, make it a better one. If you\\x92re disappointed with the mistakes \\r\\n\\t\\tof government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our \\r\\n\\t\\tArmed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public \\r\\n\\t\\toffice. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort \\r\\n\\t\\tthe afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be \\r\\n\\t\\tthe better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater \\r\\n\\t\\thappiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself. I\\x92m going to fight for my \\r\\n\\t\\tcause every day as your President. I\\x92m going to fight to make sure every \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I\\x92m an \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with \\r\\n\\t\\thard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always \\r\\n\\t\\twithin our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me. Fight for what\\x92s right for \\r\\n\\t\\tour country. Fight for the ideals and \\r\\n\\t\\tcharacter of a free people. Fight for our children\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tfuture. Fight for justice and \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity for all. Stand up to defend our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry from its enemies. Stand up for each other; for \\r\\n\\t\\tbeautiful, blessed, bountiful America. Stand up, stand up, stand up \\r\\n\\t\\tand fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We\\x92re Americans, and we never \\r\\n\\t\\tgive up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. Thank you, and God Bless \\r\\n\\t\\tyou.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Chief Justice, our distinguished House managers from \\r\\nthe House of Representatives, colleagues: I have seen the look of disappointment \\r\\non many faces because I know a lot of people thought you were rid of me once and \\r\\nfor all. And I\\'ve taken a lot of ribbing this afternoon, but I have \\r\\nseriously negotiated with some people, particularly on this side by an offer to \\r\\nwalk out and not deliver this speech in exchange for a few votes. I understand three have it under active consideration. It is a great joy to see you, and it is especially pleasant to \\r\\nsee an audience which represents about the size of the cumulative audience I had \\r\\nover a period of 24 years. And it is especially pleasant to see an audience which \\r\\nrepresents about the size of the cumulative audience I had over a period of 24 \\r\\nyears. I came here today for a lot of reasons. One was that I was \\r\\npromised a 40-foot cord -- and I\\'ve been shorted 28 feet. Chris Dodd said that \\r\\nhe didn\\'t want me in his lap, and I assume that he arranged for the cord to be \\r\\nshortened. I want to especially thank some of you for your kind comments in \\r\\nthe press when it received some publicity that I would be here to close the \\r\\ndebate on behalf of the White House Counsel and the President. I was a little \\r\\ndismayed by Senator Bennett\\'s remark. He said, \"Yes, Senator Bumpers is a great \\r\\nspeaker, but I never -- he was never persuasive with me because I never agreed \\r\\nwith him.\" I thought he could have done better than that. You can take some comfort, colleagues, in the fact that I\\'m not \\r\\nbeing paid. And when I\\'m finished you will probably think the White House \\r\\ngot their money\\'s worth. I have told audiences that over 24 years that I went home almost \\r\\nevery weekend and returned usually about dusk on Sunday evening. And you know \\r\\nthe plane ride into National Airport when you can see the magnificent Washington \\r\\nMonument and this building from the window of the airplane. And I\\'ve told these \\r\\nstudents at the university in a small, liberal arts school at home, Hendricks, \\r\\nafter 24 years of that, literally hundreds of times, I never failed to get goose bumps. Same thing is true about this chamber. I can still remember as though it were yesterday the awe I felt \\r\\nwhen I first stepped into this magnificent chamber so full of history. So \\r\\nbeautiful. And last Tuesday, as I returned after only a short three-week \\r\\nabsence, I still felt that same sense of awe that I did the first time I walked \\r\\nin this chamber. Colleagues, I come here with some sense of reluctance. The President and I have been close friends for 25 years. We\\'ve \\r\\nfought so many battles back home together in our beloved Arkansas, we tried \\r\\nmightily all of my years as Governor and his, and all of my years in the Senate \\r\\nwhen he was Governor, to raise the living standards in the Delta area of \\r\\nMississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana where poverty is unspeakable, with some \\r\\nmeasure of success -- not nearly enough. We tried to provide health care for the \\r\\nlesser among us, for those who are well-off enough they can\\'t get on welfare, \\r\\nbut not making enough to buy health insurance. We have fought, above everything else, to improve the \\r\\neducational standards for a state that, for so many years, was at the bottom of \\r\\nthe list or near the bottom of the list of income, and we have stood \\r\\nside-by-side to save beautiful, pristine areas in our state from environmental \\r\\ndegradation. We even crashed a twin-engine Beach Bonanza trying to get to theGillette Coon Supper, a political event that one misses at his own risk. And we crashed this plane on a snowy evening on a rural airport, \\r\\noff the runway, sailing out across the snow, jumped out, jumped out and ran away \\r\\nunscathed, to the dismay of every budding politician in Arkansas. The President and I have been together hundreds of times -- at \\r\\nparades, dedications, political events, social events. And in all of those \\r\\nyears, and all those hundreds of times we\\'ve been together, both in public and \\r\\nin private, I have never one time seen the President conduct himself in a way \\r\\nthat did not reflect the highest credit on him, his family, his state, and his \\r\\nbeloved nation. The reason I came here today with some reluctance -- please \\r\\ndon\\'t misconstrue that. It has nothing to do with my feelings about the \\r\\nPresident, as I\\'ve already said -- but it\\'s because we are from the same state and we are long \\r\\nfriends and I know that that necessarily diminishes to some extent the \\r\\neffectiveness of my words. So if Bill Clinton the man, Bill Clinton the friend were the \\r\\nissue here, I\\'m quite sure I would not be doing this. But it is the weight of \\r\\nhistory on all of us and it is my reverence for that great document -- and you heard \\r\\nme rail about it for 24 years -- that we call our Constitution, the most sacred \\r\\ndocument to me next to the holy Bible. These proceedings go right to the heart of our Constitution \\r\\nwhere it deals with impeachment, the part that provides the gravest punishment \\r\\nfor just about anybody, the President, even though the framers said we\\'re \\r\\nputting this in to protect the public, not to punish the President. Ah, colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility. My good \\r\\nfriend, the senior senator from New York, has said it well. He says, this -- a \\r\\ndecision to convict holds the potential for destabilizing the office of [the] \\r\\npresidency. And those 400 historians -- and I know some have made light of that \\r\\nabout those historians -- are they just friends of Bill? And last evening, I went \\r\\nover that list of -- of historians, many of whom I know, among themC. Vann Woodward. \\r\\nIn the South we love him. He is the preeminent southern historian in the nation. \\r\\nI promise you, he may be a Democrat, he may even be a -- he may be \\r\\neven a friend of the President. When you talk about integrity, he is the walking \\r\\npersonification, exemplification of integrity. Well, colleagues, I have heard so many adjectives to describe \\r\\nthis gathering and these proceedings. \"Historic,\" \"memorable,\" \"unprecedented,\" \\r\\n\"awesome\" -- all of those \\r\\nwords, all of those descriptions are apt. And to those I would add the word \\r\\n\"dangerous\" -- dangerous not only for the reasons I just stated, but because \\r\\nit\\'s dangerous to the political process and it\\'s dangerous to the unique mix of \\r\\npure democracy and republican government Madison and his colleagues so \\r\\nbrilliantly crafted, and which has sustained us for 210 years. Mr. Chief Justice, this is what we lawyers call \"dicta.\" This \\r\\ncosts you nothing. It\\'s extra. But the more I study that document and those four \\r\\nmonths at Philadelphia in 1787, the more awed I am. And you know what Madison \\r\\ndid? The brilliance was in its simplicity. He simply said: Man\\'s nature is to \\r\\nget other people to dance to their tune. Man\\'s nature is to abuse his fellow man sometimes. \\r\\nAnd he said, the way to make sure that the majorities don\\'t \\r\\nabuse the minorities, and the way to make sure that the bullies don\\'t run over \\r\\nthe weaklings is to provide the same rights for everybody. And I had to think about that a long time before I delivered my \\r\\nfirst lecture at the University of Arkansas last week. And it made so much sense \\r\\nto me. But the danger, as I say, is to the political process. And dangerous for \\r\\nreasons feared by the framers about legislative control of the executive. That single issue and how to deal with impeachment was debated \\r\\noff and on for the entire four months of the constitutional convention. But the \\r\\nword \"dangerous\" is not mine. It\\'s Alexander Hamilton\\'s -- brilliant, good-looking \\r\\nguy. Mr. Ruff quoted extensively on Tuesday afternoon in his \\r\\nbrilliant statement here. He quoted Alexander Hamilton precisely, and it\\'s a little \\r\\narcane; it isn\\'t easy to understand. So if I may, at the expense of being \\r\\nslightly repetitious, let me paraphrase what Hamilton said. He said the Senate had a unique role in participating with the \\r\\nExecutive branch in appointments. And, two, it had a role -- it had a role in \\r\\nparticipating with the Executive in the character of a court for the trial of \\r\\nimpeachments. But he said -- and I must say this, and you all know it -- he \\r\\nsaid it would be difficult to get a -- what he called well constituted court from \\r\\nwholly elected members. He said passions would agitate the whole community and \\r\\ndivide it between those who were friendly and those who had inimical interest to \\r\\nthe accused, namely the President. And then he said -- and this is his words -- the greatest danger was \\r\\nthat the decision would be based on the comparative strength of the parties \\r\\nrather than the innocence or guilt of the President. You have a solemn oath. You have taken a solemn oath to be fair \\r\\nand impartial. I know you all. I know you as friends, and I know you as \\r\\nhonorable men, and I am perfectly satisfied to put that in your hands under your \\r\\noath. This is the only caustic thing I will say in these remarks this \\r\\nafternoon, but the question is, \"How did we come to be here?\" We\\'re here \\r\\nbecause of a five-year, relentless, unending investigation of the President. \\r\\nFifty billion dollars, hundreds of FBI agents fanning across the nation \\r\\nexamining in detail the microscopic lives of people. Maybe the most intense investigation not only of a \\r\\nPresident but \\r\\nof anybody -- ever. I feel strongly about this state just because of my state, and what we \\r\\nhave endured. So you\\'ll have to excuse me, but that investigation has also shown \\r\\nthat the judicial system in this country can and does get out of kilter, unless \\r\\nit\\'s controlled, because there are innocent people -- innocent people who have \\r\\nbeen financially and mentally bankrupt[ed]. One woman told me two years ago that her legal fees were \\r\\n95,000 dollars. She said I don\\'t have $95,000 and the only asset I have is the equity \\r\\nin my home, which just happens to correspond to my legal fees of 95,000 dollars. And \\r\\nshe says the only thing I can think of to do is to deed my home. This woman was \\r\\ninnocent; never charged; testified before the grand jury a number of times. And \\r\\nsince that time, she has accumulated an additional $200,000 in attorney fees.Javert\\'spursuit ofJean Valjeanin \"Les Miserables\" pales by \\r\\ncomparison. I doubt that there are few people, maybe nobody in this body, \\r\\nwho could withstand such scrutiny. And in this case those summoned were \\r\\nterrified not because of their guilt, but because they felt guilt or innocence \\r\\nwas not really relevant. But after all of those years and 50 million \\r\\ndollars ofWhitewater,Travelgate,Filegate, you name it, nothing, nothing, \\r\\nthe President was found \\r\\nguilty of nothing, official or personal. We\\'re here today because the President suffered a terrible \\r\\nmoral lapse, a marital infidelity; not a breach of the public trust, not a crime \\r\\nagainst society, the two things Hamilton talked about in Federalist Paper number \\r\\n65 -- I recommend it to you before you vote -- but it was a breach of his \\r\\nmarriage vows. It was a breach of his family trust. It is a sex scandal.H.L. \\r\\nMenckensaid one time, \"When you hear somebody say, \\'This is not about money\\' \\r\\n-- it\\'s about money.\" And when you hear somebody say, \"This is not about sex\" \\r\\n-- it\\'s \\r\\nabout sex. You pick your own adjective to describe the \\r\\nPresident\\'s conduct. \\r\\nHere are some that I would use: \"indefensible,\" \"outrageous,\" \"unforgivable,\" \"shameless.\" I promise you the \\r\\nPresident would not contest any of those or any \\r\\nothers. But there\\'s a human element in this case that has not even been \\r\\nmentioned, and that is the President and Hillary and Chelsea are human beings. \\r\\nThis is intended only as a mild criticism of our distinguished friends in the \\r\\nHouse, but as I listened to the presenters -- to the managers make their opening \\r\\nstatements, they were remarkably well prepared, and they spoke eloquently. More \\r\\neloquent than I really had hoped. But when I talk about the human element, I talk about what I \\r\\nthought was, on occasion, unnecessarily harsh and pejorative descriptions of the \\r\\nPresident. I thought that the language should have been tempered somewhat, to \\r\\nacknowledge that he is the President. To say constantly that the President lied \\r\\nabout this and lied about that, as I say, I thought that was too much for a \\r\\nfamily that has already been about as decimated as a family can get. The relationship between husband and wife, father and child has \\r\\nbeen incredibly strained, if not destroyed. There\\'s been nothing but sleepless \\r\\nnights, mental agony for this family for almost five years -- day after day, from \\r\\naccusations of having assassinated, or had Vince Foster assassinated on down. It \\r\\nhas been bizarre. But I didn\\'t sense any compassion, and perhaps none is deserved. \\r\\nThe President has said for all to hear that he misled, he deceived, he did not \\r\\nwant to be helpful to the prosecution. And he did all of those things to his \\r\\nfamily, to his friends, to his staff, to his cabinet and to the American people. Why would he do that? Well, he knew this whole affair was about \\r\\nto bring unspeakable embarrassment and humiliation on himself, his wife whom he \\r\\nadored, and a child that he worshipped with every fiber in his body, and for \\r\\nwhom he would happily have died to spare her this or to ameliorate her shame and \\r\\nher grief. The House managers have said shame and embarrassment is no \\r\\nexcuse for lying. Well, the question about lying, that\\'s your decision. But I \\r\\ncan tell you, you put yourself in his position, and you\\'ve already had this big \\r\\nmoral lapse, as to what you would do. We are none of us perfect. Sure, you say, he should have thought \\r\\nof all that beforehand. And indeed he should. Just as Adam and Eve should have. Just as you and you and you and you, and millions of other \\r\\npeople who have been caught in similar circumstances, should have thought of it \\r\\nbefore. And I say none of us are perfect. I remember, Chaplain, the chaplain\\'s not here, is he? \\r\\nIt\\'s too bad. He ought to hear this story. This evangelist was holding this great revival meeting, and at \\r\\nthe close of one of his meetings he said, \"Is there anybody in this audience who \\r\\nhas ever known anybody who even comes close to the perfection of our Lord and \\r\\nSavior, Jesus Christ?\" Nothing. He repeated the challenge, and finally a little \\r\\nbitty guy the in back of the audience kind of held up his hand. And he said, \\r\\n\"You -- are you saying you\\'ve known such a person? Stand up.\" He stood up, and he said, \"Tell us. \\r\\nShare it with us.\" Who was it?\" He said, \"My wife\\'s first husband.\" Make no mistake about it, removal from office is punishment; it \\r\\nis unbelievable punishment, even though the framers didn\\'t quite see it that \\r\\nway. Again they said, and it bears repeating over and over again, \\r\\nthey said they wanted to protect the people. But I can tell you this: the \\r\\npunishment of removing Bill Clinton from office would pale compared to the \\r\\npunishment he has already inflicted on himself. There\\'s a feeling in this country that somehow or other Bill \\r\\nClinton\\'s gotten away with something. Mr. Leader, I can tell you, he hasn\\'t \\r\\ngotten away with anything. And the people are saying: Please don\\'t protect us \\r\\nfrom this man; 76 percent of us think he\\'s doing a fine job. Sixty-five to seventy percent of us don\\'t want \\r\\nhim removed from \\r\\noffice. And some have said, \"We\\'re not respected on the world scene.\" \\r\\nThe truth of the matter is, this nation has never enjoyed greater prestige in \\r\\nthe world than we do right now. You sawCarlos Menem, the \\r\\nPresident of \\r\\nArgentina, just here recently, say to the President, \"Mr. President, the world \\r\\nneeds you.\" The war in Bosnia is under control. The President has been as \\r\\ntenacious as anybody could be about Middle East peace. And in Ireland, actual \\r\\npeace, and maybe the Middle East will make it. And he has the Indians and the \\r\\nPakistanis talking to each other as they\\'ve never talked to each other in recent \\r\\ntimes. Vaclav Havel said, \"Mr. President, for the enlargement of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organizationthere\\'s no doubt in my mind that it was \\r\\nyour personal leadership that made this historic development possible.\" King Hussein: Mr. President, I\\'ve had the privilege of being a \\r\\nfriend of the United States and Presidents since the late President Eisenhower. \\r\\nAnd throughout all the years that have passed, I\\'ve kept in touch. But on the \\r\\nsubject of peace, the peace we\\'re seeking, I have never with all due respect and \\r\\nall the affection I held for your predecessors, have known someone with your \\r\\ndedication, clear-headedness, focus and determination to help resolve this issue \\r\\nin the best way possible. Well, I\\'m not -- I\\'ve got Nelson Mandela and other world leaders \\r\\nwho have said similar things in the last six months. Our prestige, I promise \\r\\nyou, in the world is as high as it\\'s ever been. When it comes to the question of perjury, you know, there\\'s \\r\\nperjury and then there\\'s perjury. Let me ask you if you think this is perjury.\\r\\nOn November 23rd, 1997, President Clinton went to Vancouver, \\r\\nBritish Columbia. And when he returned,Monica Lewinskywas at the White House \\r\\nat some point, and he gave her a marble, carved marble bear. I don\\'t know how \\r\\nbig it was. Question before the grand jury August 6th, 1998: \\r\\n\\t\"What was the \\r\\nChristmas present or presents that he got for you?\" Answer: \"Everything was packaged in a big Black Dog or big \\r\\ncanvass bag from theBlack Dog store in Martha\\'s Vineyard. And he got me a marble \\r\\nbear\\'s head carving, sort of, you know, -- a little -- a little sculpture, I guess you\\'d \\r\\ncall, maybe.\" [Question]: \"Was that the item from Vancouver?\" [Answer]: \"Yes.\" Question on the same day of the \\r\\n\\tsame grand jury -- Question: \"Okay, good. When the President gave you the Vancouver Bear on the 26th -- \\r\\n28th, I guess it is -- no, 26th -- [Meta-comments about problems with Bumper\\'s \\r\\nmicrophone.] [Question]: -- When the President gave you the Vancouver Bear on the 28th, did \\r\\nhe say anything about what it means?\" [Answer]: \"Mmmm.\" [Question]: \"Well, what did he say?\" Answer: \"I think he -- I believe he said that the bear is the, \\r\\nmaybe, Indian symbol for strength, you know, and to be strong like a bear.\" [Question]: \"And did you \\r\\n\\tinterpret that to be \\'strong in your decision to continue to conceal the \\r\\n\\trelationship?\\'\" [Answer]: \"No.\" House Judiciary Committee report to the full House: On the other hand, knowing the subpoena-requested gifts, his \\r\\ngiving Ms. Lewinsky more gifts on December 28th seems odd, but Ms. Lewinsky\\'s \\r\\ntestimony reveals why he did so. She said that she, \"Never questioned that we \\r\\nwould ever do anything but keep this private and that meant to take whatever \\r\\nappropriate steps needed to be taken to keep it quiet.\" The only logical \\r\\ninference is that the gifts, including the bear symbolizing strength, were a \\r\\ntacit reminder to Ms. Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship even in the \\r\\nface of a federal subpoena. She just got through saying \"No,\" and yet this \\r\\nreport says that\\'s the only logical inference. And then the brief that came over here accompanying the articles \\r\\nof impeachment said, on the other hand: ...more gifts on December 28th. Ms. \\r\\nLewinsky\\'s testimony reveals the answer. She said she was never questioned -- \\r\\nshe said that she, \"Never questioned that we were ever going to do anything but \\r\\nkeep this private, and that meant to take whatever appropriate steps needed to \\r\\nbe taken to keep it quiet. Again, they say in their brief, the only logical inference is \\r\\nthat the gifts, including the bear symbolizing strength, were a tacit reminder \\r\\nto Ms. Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship even in the face of a \\r\\nfederal subpoena. Is it perjury to say the only logical inference is something \\r\\nwhen the only shred of testimony in the record is, \"No,\" that was not my \\r\\ninterpretation. I didn\\'t imply -- I didn\\'t infer that.¹And yet here you have it in the committee \\r\\nreport and you have it in the brief. Now of course that\\'s not perjury. \\r\\nFirst of all, it isn\\'t under oath, but as a trial lawyer, I\\'ll tell you what it \\r\\nis: It\\'s wanting to win too badly. I tried three, four, maybe 500 divorce cases \\r\\n-- incidentally, you\\'re being addressed by the entire South Franklin County, \\r\\nArkansas Bar Association; I can\\'t believe there were that many cases in that \\r\\nlittle town, but I had a practice in surrounding communities, too -- and in all those divorce cases, I would guess that in 80 percent \\r\\nof the contested cases, perjury was committed. And you know what it was about? \\r\\nSex. Extramarital affairs. But there\\'s a very big difference in perjury about a marital \\r\\ninfidelity in a divorce case and perjury about whether I bought the murder \\r\\nweapon or whether I concealed the murder weapon or not. And to charge somebody with the first and punish them as though \\r\\nit were the second stands justice, our sense of justice, on its head. There\\'s a total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance \\r\\nin this thing. The charge and the punishment are totally out of sync. All of you have heard or read the testimony of the five \\r\\nprosecutors who testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Five seasoned \\r\\nprosecutors. And each one of them, veterans, said under the identical \\r\\ncircumstances, the identical circumstances of this case, we would never charge \\r\\nanybody because we\\'d know we couldn\\'t get a conviction. And in this case, the charges brought and the punishment sought \\r\\nare totally out of sync. There is no balance, there is no proportionality. But even stranger, you think about it, even if this case had \\r\\noriginated in the courthouse rather than the capitol, you would never have heard \\r\\nof it. How do you reconcile what the prosecutors said with what we\\'re doing \\r\\nhere? Impeachment was debated off and on in Philadelphia for the \\r\\nentire four months, as I said. The key players were Governor [Lewis] Morris, \\r\\nSenator Specter, a brilliant Pennsylvanian, George Mason, the only man to -- reputedly to have been so brilliant \\r\\nthat Thomas Jefferson actually deferred to him. And he refused to sign the \\r\\nConstitution, incidentally, even though he was a delegate, because they didn\\'t \\r\\ndeal with slavery and he was a strict abolitionist. And then there was Charles Pinkney [ph]. Senator Hollings from \\r\\nSouth Carolina, just a youngster, 29 years old, I believe.Edmund Randolphfrom Virginia, who had a big role in the \\r\\nConstitution in the beginning; the Virginia Plan. And then there was, of course, \\r\\nJames Madison, the craftsman. They were all key players in drafting this impeachment \\r\\nprovision. And uppermost in their mind during the entire time they were composing \\r\\nwas they did not want any kings. They had lived under despots, they had lived \\r\\nunder kings, they had lived under autocrats, and they didn\\'t want anymore of \\r\\nthat. And they succeeded very admirably. We\\'ve had 46 presidents, and no kings. But they kept talking about corruption. \\r\\nMaybe that ought to be \\r\\nthe reason for impeachment, because they feared some President would corrupt the \\r\\npolitical process -- that\\'s what the debate was about -- corrupt the political \\r\\nprocess and ensconce himself through a phony election, maybe as something close \\r\\nto a king. They followed the British rule on impeachment, because the \\r\\nBritish said, the House of Commons may impeach, and the House of Lords must \\r\\nconvict. And every one of the colonies had the same procedure: House, Senate. \\r\\nThough, in all fairness, House members, James -- or Alexander Hamilton was not very keen on \\r\\nthe House participating. But here was the sequence of events at Philadelphia that brought \\r\\nus here today. They started out with \"maladministration,\" and Madison said \\r\\nthat\\'s too vague. What does that mean? So they dropped that. They went from that \\r\\nto \"corruption\" and they dropped that. Then they went to \"malpractice.\" And they \\r\\ndecided that was not definitive enough. And they went to \"treason, bribery and corruption.\" And they \\r\\ndecided that still didn\\'t suit them. But bear in mind one thing, during this \\r\\nentire process, they are narrowing -- they are narrowing the things you can \\r\\nimpeach the President for. They were making it tougher. Madison said if we \\r\\naren\\'t careful, the President will serve at the pleasure of the legislature -- \\r\\nthe Senate, he said. And then they went to \"treason and bribery\" and somebody said \\r\\nthat\\'s still not quite enough. And so they went to treason, bribery -- George Mason added \"or \\r\\nother high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States.\" And they voted on \\r\\nit, and on September 10th they sent the entire Constitution to a committee. They called a committee on style and arrangement, which was the \\r\\ncommittee that would draft the language in a way that everybody would \\r\\nunderstand; it would be well-crafted from a grammatical standpoint. But that \\r\\ncommittee, which was dominated by Madison and Hamilton, dropped \"against the \\r\\nUnited States.\" And historians will tell you that the reason they did that was \\r\\nbecause of redundance, because that committee had no right to change the \\r\\nsubstance of anything. And they would not have -- they would not have dropped it if they hadn\\'t felt that \\r\\nit was redundant. And then, they put in for good measure \\r\\n-- and we can always be \\r\\ngrateful -- the two-thirds majority. Now this is one of the most important points of this entire \\r\\npresentation: the term -- first of all -- \"treason and bribery,\" nobody quarrels \\r\\nwith that, and we\\'re not debating treason and bribery here in this chamber. \\r\\nWe\\'re talking about \"other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"  [Unidentified meta-comments]  Thank you. And where did \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" come from? It came \\r\\nfrom the English law, and they found it in English law under a category which \\r\\nsaid, \"distinctly political offenses against the state.\" Let me repeat that. \\r\\nThey said, \"high crimes and misdemeanors was to be,\" because they took it from \\r\\nEnglish law, where they found it in the category that said, \"offenses distinctly \\r\\npolitical against the state.\" So colleagues, please, for just one moment, forget the \\r\\ncomplexities of the facts and the tortured legalisms. And we\\'ve heard them all \\r\\nbrilliantly presented on both sides, and I\\'m not getting into that. But ponder this. If high crimes and misdemeanors was taken from \\r\\nEnglish law by George Mason, which listed high crimes and misdemeanors as \\r\\npolitical offenses against the state, what are we doing here? If, as Hamilton said, it had to be a crime against society or a \\r\\nbreach of the public trust, what are we doing here? Even perjury. Concealing or deceiving. An unfaithful \\r\\nrelationship does not even come close to being an impeachable offense. Nobody has suggested that Bill Clinton committed a political \\r\\ncrime against the state. So, colleagues, if you honor the Constitution, you must \\r\\nlook at the history of the Constitution and how we got to the impeachment \\r\\nclause. And if you do that and you do that honestly according to the oath you \\r\\ntook, you cannot -- you can censure Bill Clinton; you can hand him over to the \\r\\nprosecutor for him to be prosecuted, but you cannot convict him. And you cannot \\r\\nindulge yourselves the luxury or the right to ignore this history. There\\'s been a suggestion that a vote to acquit would be \\r\\nsomething of a breach of faith with those who lie inFlanders FieldandAnzioandBunker HillandGettysburgand wherever. I didn\\'t hear that; I read \\r\\nabout it. But I want to say -- and, incidentally, I think it was Chairman \\r\\nHyde who alluded to this and said: those men fought and died for the rule of \\r\\nlaw. I can remember a cold November 3rd morning in my little home town \\r\\nofCharleston, Arkansas.I was 18 years old. I\\'d just gotten one semester \\r\\nin at the university when I went into the Marine Corps. And so, I was to report to Little Rock to be inducted. \\r\\nMy, it was cold. The drug store was the bus stop. I had to be there by eight \\r\\no\\'clock to be sworn in, and I had to catch the bus down at the drug store at \\r\\nthree o\\'clock in the morning so my mother and father and I got up at two o\\'clock \\r\\nand got dressed and went down there. (I\\'m not sure I can tell you this story.) And the bus came over the hill -- I was rather frightened anyway \\r\\nabout going in. I was quite sure I was going to be killed, only slightly less \\r\\nfrightened that Betty would find somebody else while I was gone.  \\r\\nAnd the bus came over Schoolhouse Hill, and my parents started \\r\\ncrying. I had never seen my father cry. I knew I was in some difficulty. Now, as a parent at my age, I know he thought he was giving not \\r\\nhis only begotten son, but one of his forgotten -- begotten sons. Can you imagine? You know \\r\\nthat scene. It was repeated across this nation millions of times. And then happily, I survived that war; saw no combat; was on my \\r\\nway to Japan when it all ended. I\\'d never had a terrible problem with dropping \\r\\nthe bomb, though that\\'s been a terrible moral dilemma for me, because that the \\r\\nestimates were that we would lose as many as a million men in that invasion. But I came home into a generous government who provided me, under \\r\\nthe GI Bill, an education in a fairly prestigious law school which my father \\r\\ncould never have afforded. And I practiced law in this little town for 18 years; \\r\\nloved every minute of it. But I didn\\'t practice constitutional law, and I knew \\r\\nvery little about the Constitution. But when I went into law school, I did study \\r\\nconstitutional law, though Mr. Chief Justice, it was fairly arcane to me. And trying read The Federalist Papers and Tocqueville -- all of \\r\\nthose things law students are expected to do, that was tough for me, I confess. So after 18 years in law practice I jumped up and ran for \\r\\ngovernor and I served for governor -- as governor for four years, and I still -- I guess I knew \\r\\nwhat the rule of law was -- but I still didn\\'t really have much reverence for the \\r\\nConstitution. I just did not understand any of the things I just got through \\r\\ntelling you. No. My love for that document came day after day and debate \\r\\nafter debate right here in this chamber. Some of you perhaps read an op-ed piece I did a couple of weeks \\r\\nago when I said I was perfectly happy for my legacy of a 24-year-senator-to-be \\r\\nI never voted for a constitutional amendment. And it isn\\'t that I wouldn\\'t. I \\r\\nthink they made a mistake in not giving you fellows four years. You\\'re about to cause me to rethink that one. And the reason I developed this love of it is because I saw \\r\\nMadison\\'s magic working time and time again, keeping bullies from running over \\r\\nweak people, keeping majorities from running over minorities. And I thought about all the unfettered freedoms we had. The \\r\\noldest organic law in existence made us the envy of the world. Mr. Chairman, we\\'ve also learned that the rule of law includes \\r\\npresidential elections. That\\'s a part of the rule of law in this country. We \\r\\nhave an event, a quadrennial event in this country which we call \"Presidential \\r\\nElections.\" And that\\'s the day when we reach across this aisle and hold hands, \\r\\nDemocrats and Republicans. And we say, \"Win or lose, we will abide by the \\r\\ndecision.\" It is a solemn event, presidential elections, and it should not \\r\\n-- they should not be undone lightly; or just because one side has the clout and \\r\\nthe other one doesn\\'t. And if you want to know what men fought for in World War \\r\\nII, for example, or in Vietnam, askSenator Inouye. He left an arm in Italy. He and I were in the presence at \\r\\nNormandy on the 50th anniversary. But we started off on Anzil [ph]. Senator Domenici, were you with us? It was one of the most awesome experiences I\\'ve ever had in my \\r\\nlife -- certified war hero. I think his relatives were in a internment camp, so \\r\\nask him what he was fighting for? Or askBob Kerrey, certified Medal of Honor winner \\r\\n-- what was he \\r\\nfighting for? Probably get a quite different answer. OrSenator Chafee, one of the finest men ever to grace this body \\r\\nand certified marine hero ofGuadalcanal-- ask him. AndSenator McCain, a genuine hero -- ask him. You don\\'t have to guess. They\\'re with us, and they\\'re living. And they can tell you. And one who is not with us here in the \\r\\nSenate anymore,Robert Dole. Ask Senator Dole what he was fighting for. Senator \\r\\nDole had what I thought was a very reasonable solution to this whole thing that \\r\\nwould handle it fairly and expeditiously. The American people are now and for some time have been asking \\r\\nto be allowed a good night\\'s sleep. They\\'re asking for an end to this nightmare. \\r\\nIt is a legitimate request. I\\'m not suggesting that you vote for or against the polls. I \\r\\nunderstand that. Nobody should vote against the polls just to show their mettle \\r\\nand their courage. I have cast plenty of votes against the polls and it\\'s cost \\r\\nme politically a lot of times. This has been going on for a year, though. And in that same op-ed piece I talked about meeting Harry Truman \\r\\nmy first year as governor of Arkansas. Spent an hour with him. An indelible experience. People at home \\r\\nkid me about this, because I very seldom make a speech that I don\\'t mention this \\r\\nmeeting. But I will never forget what he said, \"Put your faith in the people. \\r\\nTrust the people. They can handle it.\" They have shown conclusively time and time again that they can \\r\\nhandle it. Colleagues, this is easily the most important vote you will ever \\r\\ncast. If you have difficulty because of an intense dislike of the president -- \\r\\nand that\\'s understandable -- rise above it. He is not the issue. He will be gone. You won\\'t. So don\\'t leave a precedent from \\r\\nwhich we may never recover and almost surely will regret. If you vote to acquit, Mr. Leader, you know exactly what\\'s going \\r\\nto happen. You\\'re going to back to your committees. You\\'re going to get on this \\r\\nlegislative agenda. You\\'re going to start dealing with Medicare and Social \\r\\nSecurity and tax cuts and all those things which the people of the country have \\r\\na non-negotiable demand that you do. If you vote to acquit, you go immediately to the people\\'s \\r\\nagenda. But if you vote to convict, you can\\'t be sure what\\'s going to happen.James G. Blainewas a member of the Senate whenAndrew Johnsonwas tried in \\r\\n1868, and 20 years later he recanted. And he said: \"I made a bad mistake.\" And \\r\\nhe says \"as I reflect back on it, all I can think about is having convicted \\r\\nAndrew Johnson would have caused much more chaos and confusion in this country \\r\\nthan Andrew Johnson could ever conceivably have tried.\" And so it is with William Jefferson Clinton. If you vote to \\r\\nconvict, in my opinion you\\'re going to be creating more havoc than he could ever \\r\\npossibly create. After all, he\\'s only got two years left. So don\\'t, for God\\'s \\r\\nsakes heighten people\\'s alienation that is at an all time high toward their \\r\\ngovernment. The people have a right and they are calling on you to rise \\r\\nabove politics, rise above partisanship. They\\'re calling on you to do your \\r\\nsolemn duty. And I pray you will. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.',\n",
       " 'Good Evening: This a special night for me. Exactly three years ago, on July 15, 1976, I \\r\\naccepted the nomination of my party to run for President of the United States. I \\r\\npromised you a President who is not isolated from the people, who feels your \\r\\npain, and who shares your dreams, and who draws his strength and his wisdom from \\r\\nyou. During the past three years I\\x92ve spoken to you on many occasions about \\r\\nnational concerns, the energy crisis, reorganizing the government, our nation\\x92s \\r\\neconomy, and issues of war and especially peace. But over those years the \\r\\nsubjects of the speeches, the talks, and the press conferences have become \\r\\nincreasingly narrow, focused more and more on what the isolated world of \\r\\nWashington thinks is important. Gradually, you\\x92ve heard more and more about what \\r\\nthe government thinks or what the government should be doing and less and less about \\r\\nour nation\\x92s hopes, our dreams, and our vision of the future. Ten days ago, I had planned to speak to youagain about a very important \\r\\nsubject -- energy. For the fifth time I would have described the urgency of the \\r\\nproblem and laid out a series of legislative recommendations to the Congress. \\r\\nBut as I was preparing to speak, I began to ask myself the same question that I \\r\\nnow know has been troubling many of you: Why have we not been able to get \\r\\ntogether as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem? It\\x92s clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper \\r\\n-- deeper than \\r\\ngasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation or recession. And \\r\\nI realize more than ever that as President I need your help. So, I decided to \\r\\nreach out and to listen to the voices of America. I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our \\r\\nsociety -- business and labor, teachers and preachers, governors, mayors, and \\r\\nprivate citizens. And then I left Camp David to listen to other Americans, men \\r\\nand women like you. It has been an extraordinary ten days, and I want to share \\r\\nwith you what I\\x92ve heard. First of all, I got a lot of personal advice. Let me quote a few of the \\r\\ntypical comments that I wrote down. This from a southern governor: \\x93Mr. President, you are not leading this \\r\\nnation -- you\\x92re just managing the government.\\x94 \\x93You don\\x92t see the people enough anymore.\\x94 \\x93Some of your Cabinet members don\\x92t seem loyal. There is not enough \\r\\ndiscipline among your disciples.\\x94 \\x93Don\\x92t talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government, but about an \\r\\nunderstanding of our common good.\\x94 \\x93Mr. President, we\\x92re in trouble. Talk to us about blood and sweat and \\r\\ntears.\\x94 \\x93If you lead, Mr. President, we will follow.\\x94 Many people talked about themselves and about the condition of our nation. \\r\\nThis from a young woman in Pennsylvania: \\x93I feel so far from government. I feel \\r\\nlike ordinary people are excluded from political power.\\x94 And this from a young Chicano: \\x93Some of us have suffered from recession all \\r\\nour lives.\\x94 \\x93Some people have wasted energy, but others haven\\x92t had anything to waste.\\x94 And this from a religious leader: \\x93No material shortage can touch the \\r\\nimportant things like God\\x92s love for us or our love for one another.\\x94 And I like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the \\r\\nmayor of a small Mississippi town: \\x93The big shots are not the only ones who are \\r\\nimportant. Remember, you can\\x92t sell anything on Wall Street unless someone digs \\r\\nit up somewhere else first.\\x94 This kind of summarized a lot of other statements: \\x93Mr. President, we are \\r\\nconfronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis.\\x94 Several of our discussions were on energy, and I have a notebook full of \\r\\ncomments and advice. I\\x92ll read just a few. \\x93We can\\x92t go on consuming forty percent more energy then we produce. When we \\r\\nimport oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment.\\x94 \\x93We\\x92ve got to use what we have. The Middle East has only five percent of the \\r\\nworld\\x92s energy, but the United States has twenty-four percent.\\x94 And this is one of the most vivid statements: \\x93Our neck is stretched over the \\r\\nfence and OPEC has a knife.\\x94 \\x93There will be other cartels and other shortages. American wisdom and courage \\r\\nright now can set a path to follow in the future.\\x94 This was a good one: \\x93Be bold, Mr. President. We may make mistakes, but we \\r\\nare ready to experiment.\\x94 And this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it: \\x93The real issue is \\r\\nfreedom. We must deal with the energy problem on a war footing.\\x94 And the last that I\\x92ll read: \\x93When we enter the moral equivalent of war, Mr. \\r\\nPresident, don\\x92t issue us BB guns.\\x94 These ten days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the \\r\\nwisdom of the American people, but it also bore out some of my longstanding \\r\\nconcerns about our nation\\x92s underlying problems. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); I know, of course, being President, that government actions and legislation \\r\\ncan be very important. That\\x92s why I\\x92ve worked hard to put my campaign promises \\r\\ninto law, and I have to admit, with just mixed success. But after listening to \\r\\nthe American people, I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the \\r\\nworld can\\x92t fix what\\x92s wrong with America. So, I want to speak to you first \\r\\ntonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation. I want to \\r\\ntalk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy. I do not mean our political and civil liberties. They will endure. And I do \\r\\nnot refer to the outward strength of America, a nation that is at peace tonight \\r\\neverywhere in the world, with unmatched economic power and military might. The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and \\r\\nspirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about \\r\\nthe meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our \\r\\nnation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the \\r\\nsocial and the political fabric of America. The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some \\r\\nromantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of \\r\\nJuly. It is the idea which founded our nation and has guided our development as \\r\\na people. Confidence in the future has supported everything else -- public \\r\\ninstitutions and private enterprise, our own families, and the very Constitution \\r\\nof the United States. Confidence has defined our course and has served as a link \\r\\nbetween generations. We\\x92ve always believed in something called progress. We\\x92ve \\r\\nalways had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own. Our people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the \\r\\nability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our \\r\\ndemocracy. As a people we know our past and we are proud of it. Our progress has \\r\\nbeen part of the living history of America, even the world. We always believed that we were part of a great movement of \\r\\nhumanity itself called democracy, involved in the search for freedom; and that \\r\\nbelief has always strengthened us in our purpose. But just as we are losing our \\r\\nconfidence in the future, we are also beginning to close the door on our past.  In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit \\r\\ncommunities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship \\r\\nself-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one \\r\\ndoes, but by what one owns. But we\\x92ve discovered that owning things and \\r\\nconsuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We\\x92ve learned that \\r\\npiling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no \\r\\nconfidence or purpose. The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the \\r\\nfirst time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the \\r\\nnext five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people \\r\\ndo not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and \\r\\nthe willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all \\r\\nother people in the Western world. As you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches \\r\\nand for schools, the news media, and other institutions. This is not a message \\r\\nof happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning. These changes did not happen overnight. They\\x92ve come upon us gradually over \\r\\nthe last generation, years that were filled with shocks and tragedy. We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot, not the bullet, until the \\r\\nmurders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. We were \\r\\ntaught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just, \\r\\nonly to suffer the agony of Vietnam. We respected the Presidency as a place of \\r\\nhonor until the shock of Watergate. We remember when the phrase \\x93sound as a dollar\\x94 was an expression of absolute \\r\\ndependability, until ten years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our \\r\\nsavings. We believed that our nation\\x92s resources were limitless until 1973 when \\r\\nwe had to face a growing dependence on foreign oil. These wounds are still very deep. They have never been healed. Looking for a way out of this crisis, our people have turned to the Federal \\r\\nGovernment and found it isolated from the mainstream of our nation\\x92s life. \\r\\nWashington, D.C., has become an island. The gap between our citizens and our \\r\\ngovernment has never been so wide. The people are looking for honest answers, \\r\\nnot easy answers; clear leadership, not false claims and evasiveness and \\r\\npolitics as usual. What you see too often in Washington and elsewhere around the country is a \\r\\nsystem of government that seems incapable of action. You see a Congress twisted \\r\\nand pulled in every direction by hundreds of well-financed and powerful special \\r\\ninterests. You see every extreme position defended to the last vote, almost to the last \\r\\nbreath by one unyielding group or another. You often see a balanced and a fair \\r\\napproach that demands sacrifice, a little sacrifice from everyone, abandoned \\r\\nlike an orphan without support and without friends. Often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift. You don\\x92t like it, and \\r\\nneither do I. What can we do? First of all, we must face the truth, and then we can change our course. We \\r\\nsimply must have faith in each other, faith in our ability to govern ourselves, \\r\\nand faith in the future of this nation. Restoring that faith and that confidence \\r\\nto America is now the most important task we face. It is a true challenge of \\r\\nthis generation of Americans. One of the visitors to Camp David last week put it this way: \\x93We\\x92ve got to \\r\\nstop crying and start sweating, stop talking and start walking, stop cursing and \\r\\nstart praying. The strength we need will not come from the White House, but from \\r\\nevery house in America.\\x94 We know the strength of America. We are strong. We can regain our unity. \\r\\nWe can regain our confidence. We \\r\\nare the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and awesome \\r\\nthan those that challenge us now. Our fathers and mothers were strong men and \\r\\nwomen who shaped a new society during the Great Depression, who fought world \\r\\nwars and who carved out a new charter of peace for the world. We ourselves are the same Americans who just ten years ago put a man on the \\r\\nmoon. We are the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human \\r\\nrights and equality. And we are the generation that will win the war on the \\r\\nenergy problem and in that process, rebuild the unity and confidence of America. We are at a turning point in our history. There are two paths to choose. One \\r\\nis a path I\\x92ve warned about tonight, the path that leads to fragmentation and \\r\\nself-interest. Down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom, the right to \\r\\ngrasp for ourselves some advantage over others. That path would be one of \\r\\nconstant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility. It is \\r\\na certain route to failure. All the traditions of our past, all the lessons of our heritage, all the \\r\\npromises of our future point to another path -- the path of common purpose and the \\r\\nrestoration of American values. That path leads to true freedom for our nation \\r\\nand ourselves. We can take the first steps down that path as we begin to solve \\r\\nour energy problem. Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation, and it \\r\\ncan also be the standard around which we rally. On the battlefield of energy we \\r\\ncan win for our nation a new confidence, and we can seize control again of our \\r\\ncommon destiny. In little more than two decades we\\x92ve gone from a position of energy \\r\\nindependence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign \\r\\ncountries, at prices that are going through the roof. Our excessive dependence \\r\\non OPEC has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people. This is the direct cause of the long \\r\\nlines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for \\r\\ngasoline. It\\x92s a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now \\r\\nface. This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic \\r\\nindependence and the very security of our nation. The energy crisis is real. It is worldwide. It is a clear and present danger \\r\\nto our nation. These are facts and we simply must face them. What I have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important. Point one: I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the \\r\\nUnited States. Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign \\r\\noil than we did in 1977-- never. From now on, every new addition to our demand for \\r\\nenergy will be met from our own production and our own conservation. The \\r\\ngeneration-long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in \\r\\nits tracks right now and then reversed as we move through the 1980s, for I am \\r\\ntonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by \\r\\none-half by the end of the next decade -- a saving of over four and a half million \\r\\nbarrels of imported oil per day. Point two: To ensure that we meet these targets, I will use my presidential \\r\\nauthority to set import quotas. I\\x92m announcing tonight that for 1979 and 1980, I \\r\\nwill forbid the entry into this country of one drop of foreign oil more than \\r\\nthese goals allow. These quotas will ensure a reduction in imports even below \\r\\nthe ambitious levels we set at the recent Tokyo summit. Point three: To give us energy security, I am asking for the most massive \\r\\npeacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nation\\x92s history to develop \\r\\nAmerica\\x92s own alternative sources of fuel -- from coal, from oil shale, from plant \\r\\nproducts for gasohol, from unconventional gas, from the sun. I propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort \\r\\nto replace two and a half million barrels of imported oil per day by 1990. The \\r\\ncorporation will issue up to five billion dollars in energy bonds, and I \\r\\nespecially want them to be in small denominations so average Americans can \\r\\ninvest directly in America\\x92s energy security. Just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win World War II, so \\r\\nwill we mobilize American determination and ability to win the energy war. \\r\\nMoreover, I will soon submit legislation to Congress calling for the creation of \\r\\nthis nation\\x92s first solar bank which will help us achieve the crucial goal of \\r\\ntwenty percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000. These efforts will cost money, a lot of money, and that is why Congress must \\r\\nenact the windfall profits tax without delay. It will be money well spent. \\r\\nUnlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for \\r\\nforeign oil, these funds will be paid by Americans, to Americans. These will go to fight, not to increase, inflation and \\r\\nunemployment. Point four: I\\x92m asking Congress to mandate, to require as a matter of law, \\r\\nthat our nation\\x92s utility companies cut their massive use of oil by fifty \\r\\npercent within the next decade and switch to other fuels, especially coal, our \\r\\nmost abundant energy source. Point five: To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of \\r\\nachieving these goals, I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization \\r\\nboard which, like the War Production Board in World War II, will have the \\r\\nresponsibility and authority to cut through the red tape, the delays, and the \\r\\nendless roadblocks to completing key energy projects. We will protect our environment. But when this nation critically needs a \\r\\nrefinery or a pipeline, we will  build it. Point six: I\\x92m proposing a bold conservation program to involve every state, \\r\\ncounty, and city and every average American in our energy battle. This effort \\r\\nwill permit you to build conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost \\r\\nyou can afford. I ask Congress to give me authority for mandatory conservation and for \\r\\nstandby gasoline rationing. To further conserve energy, I\\x92m proposing tonight an \\r\\nextra ten billion dollars over the next decade to strengthen our public \\r\\ntransportation systems. And I\\x92m asking you for your good and for your nation\\x92s \\r\\nsecurity to take no unnecessary trips, to use carpools or public transportation \\r\\nwhenever you can, to park your car one extra day per week, to obey the speed \\r\\nlimit, and to set your thermostats to save fuel. Every act of energy \\r\\nconservation like this is more than just common sense, I tell you it is an act \\r\\nof patriotism. Our nation must be fair to the poorest among us, so we will increase aid to \\r\\nneedy Americans to cope with rising energy prices. We often think of \\r\\nconservation only in terms of sacrifice. In fact, it is the most painless and \\r\\nimmediate ways of rebuilding our nation\\x92s strength. Every gallon of oil each one \\r\\nof us saves is a new form of production. It gives us more freedom, more \\r\\nconfidence, that much more control over our own lives. So, the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis \\r\\nof the spirit in our country. It can rekindle our sense of unity, our confidence \\r\\nin the future, and give our nation and all of us individually a new sense of \\r\\npurpose. You know we can do it. We have the natural resources. We have more oil in our \\r\\nshale alone than several Saudi Arabias. We have more coal than any nation on \\r\\nearth. We have the world\\x92s highest level of \\r\\ntechnology. We have the most skilled work force, with innovative genius, and I \\r\\nfirmly believe that we have the national will to win this war. I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy. I do not \\r\\npromise a quick way out of our nation\\x92s problems, when the truth is that the \\r\\nonly way out is an all-out effort. What I do promise you is that I will lead our \\r\\nfight, and I will enforce fairness in our struggle, and I will ensure honesty. \\r\\nAnd above all, I will act. We can manage the short-term shortages more effectively, and we will; but there \\r\\nare no short-term solutions to our long-range problems. There is simply no way \\r\\nto avoid sacrifice. Twelve hours from now I will speak again in Kansas City, to expand and to \\r\\nexplain further our energy program. Just as the search for solutions to our \\r\\nenergy shortages has now led us to a new awareness of our nation\\x92s deeper \\r\\nproblems, so our willingness to work for those solutions in energy can \\r\\nstrengthen us to attack those deeper problems. I will continue to travel this country, to hear the people of America. You \\r\\ncan help me to develop a national agenda for the 1980s. I will listen; and I will \\r\\nact. We will act together. These were the promises I made three years ago, and I intend to keep them. Little by little we can and we must rebuild our confidence. We can spend \\r\\nuntil we empty our treasuries, and we may summon all the wonders of science. But \\r\\nwe can succeed only if we tap our greatest resources -- America\\x92s people, America\\x92s \\r\\nvalues, and America\\x92s confidence. I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our \\r\\npeople. In the days to come, let us renew that strength in the struggle for an \\r\\nenergy-secure nation. In closing, let me say this: I will do my best, but I will not do it alone. \\r\\nLet your voice be heard. Whenever you have a chance, say something good about \\r\\nour country. With God\\x92s help and for the sake of our nation, it is time for us \\r\\nto join hands in America. Let us commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the \\r\\nAmerican spirit. Working together with our common faith we cannot fail. Thank you and good night.',\n",
       " 'Nancy, Strom [Jr.], Julie and Paul: James Strom Thurmond: Fritz [looking directly atSenator Ernest \"Fritz\" Hollings], he was one complex guy. For what else would explain that he asked, I\\x92m told by Nancy, a guy namedBidenfrom the state of Delaware to be one of his eulogists? I\\x92ll never figure him out. And, Strom, I won\\x92t forgive it. Lindsey, I always thought I was in control, but I knew down deep I wasn\\x92t, and I think this is his last laugh. For what else could explain a Northeast liberal\\x92s presence here as the only outsider speaking today? With the possible exception ofVice President Cheney. Strom Thurmond was the only man whom I knew who in a literal sense lived in three distinct and separate periods of American history, and lived what would have been considered a full life in each of those periods, particularly in his beloved South. Born into an era of essentially unchallenged and unexamined mores of the South, reaching his full maturity in a era of fully challenged and critically exam[in]ed bankrupt mores of his beloved South, and living out his final three decades in a South that had formally rejected its past on race. In each of these stages, in my observation -- and I was only with him the last three decades -- Strom represented exactly where he came from. There\\'s an old hymn that includes these lyrics: Once to every man \\tand nation comes the moment to decide,In the strife of \\tTruth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;...Then it is the \\tbrave man chooses while the coward stands aside....1 No one ever doubted Strom Thurmond\\x92s physical courage. You\\x92ve heard much written about it. Not 15 years ago I was reminded of this. I was coming across to vote in the Senate and going up the escalator, and a fellow who apparently had held a longtime grudge against Senator Thurmond, a tourist, literally interposed himself between me and Strom and then said -- and Thad may remember this -- and said, \"If you weren\\x92t so old, I would knock you\" -- and, Reverend, I will not say what he said -- \"I will knock you down.\" And I immediately stood between them. And Strom literally took off his coat and said, \"Hold my coat, Joe.\" (Swear to God.) And I looked at him and said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no.\" And with that, he went down and did 25 pushups. He had to be 88, 87. He stood up and looked at the man -- he said, \"If you weren\\x92t so young I\\x92d knock you down.\" Strom Thurmond was also a brave man, who in the end made his choice and moved to the good side. I disagreed deeply with Strom on the issue of civil rights and on many other issues, but I watched him change. We became good friends. I\\x92m not sure exactly why or how it happened, Nancy [Thurmond], but you know we did. And Fritz [Hollings] could never figure it out. Neither could I.Fritz [Hollings]is my very closest friend in the Senate. But I do know that friendship and death are great equalizers, where our differences become irrelevant and the only thing that is left is what\\x92s in our heart. I went to the Senate emboldened, angered, and outraged at age 29 about the treatment of African-Americans in this country, what everything that for a period in his life Strom had represented. But then I met the man. Our differences were profound, but I came to understand that asArchibald MacLeishwrote, \"It is not in the world of ideas that life is lived: Life is lived for better or worse in life.\"2Strom and I shared a life in the Senate for over 30 years. We shared a good life there, and it made a difference. I grew to know him. I looked into his heart and I saw a man, a whole man. I tried to understand him. I learned from him. And I watched him change oh so suddenly. Like all of us, Strom was a product of his time. But he understood people. He cared for them. He truly wanted to help. He knew how to read people, how to move them, how to get things done. [I\\x92ll] never forget we went down to seePresident Reagan. He and I had theThurmond-Biden crime bill. And he was -- we sat in a room with Senator -- with President Reagan and withEd Meese,Jim Baker, andWilliam French Smith, the attorney general. And Strom started to try to convince the President to sign onto our bill, and he turned to me -- he said, \"Joe, explain it to them.\" So I did my little bit, and it looked like the President was coming along. And I swear to the Lord in the Lord\\x92s house this is a true story. And with that, as Ed Meese, Mr. Vice President, thought the President might be convinced, Ed Meese stood up and said, \"Mr. President, time to go...time to go.\" And with that, the President very dutifully looked -- not dutifully, but very respectfully -- looked over and said, \"Well, Strom\" -- we were sitting next to him [on] either side -- \"I have to go.\" And he had his hands on the table, and the President -- the President went to get up like this -- the -- and Strom grabbed his arm and pulled him back down in his seat. I never saw anybody do that to a President. And the President -- true story -- President looked very sternly at Strom, and Strom said with his hands still on his arm, he said, \"Mr. President, when ya\\'ll get to be my age you\\x92ll understand you\\'ve got to compromise.\" And the President then was about 85 years old. Strom knew America was changing, and that there was a lot he didn\\x92t understand about that change. Much of that change challenged many of his long-held views. But he also saw his beloved South Carolina and the people of South Carolina changing as well, and he knew the time had come to change himself. But I believe the change came to him easily. I believe he welcomed it, because I watched others of his era fight that change and never ultimately change. It would be humbling to think that I was among those who had some influence on his decision, but I know better. The place in which I work is a majestic place. If you\\x92re there long enough, it has an impact on you. You cannot, if you respect those with whom you serve, fail to understand how deeply they feel about things differently than you. And over time, I believe it has an affect on you. This is a man, who in 1947, the New York Times ran a lead editorial saying, \"Strom Thurmond, Hope of the South,\" and talked about how he had set up reading programs, get better books for separate, but equal schools. This is a man who was opposed to thepoll tax. This is a man who I watched vote for the extension of theVoting Rights Act. This is a man who I watched vote for theMartin Luther King Holiday. And it\\x92s fairly easy to say today that that was pure political expediency, but I choose to believe otherwise. I choose to believe that Strom Thurmond was doing what few do once they pass the age of 50: He was continuing to grow, continuing to change. His offices were next door to mine in the Russell Building, or more appropriately mine were next to his. And over the years, I remember seeing a lot change, including the number of African-Americans on his staff and African-Americans who sought his help. For the man who will see, time heals, time changes, and time leads him to truth. But only a special man like Strom would have the courage to accept it, the grace to acknowledge it, and the humility in the face of lasting enmity and mistrust to pursue it until the end. There\\x92s a personal lesson that comes from a page in American political history that is yet unwritten, but nevertheless, it resonates in my heart. I mentioned it on the floor of the Senate the other day. It\\x92s a lesson of redemption that I think applies today, and I think Strom, as he listens, will appreciate it. When I first arrived in the Senate in 1972, I met withJohn Stennis, another old Southern Senator, who became my friend. We sat at the other end of this gigantic, grand mahogany table he used as his desk that had been the desk ofRichard Russell\\x92s. It was a table upon which theSouthern Manifestowas signed, I am told. The year was 1972. Senator Stennis patted the leather chair next to him when I walked in to pay my respects as a new, young Senator, which was the order of the day. And he said, \"Sit down, sit down, sit down here, son.\" And those who served with him know he always talked like this [pointing index finger gesture with right arm extended]. And he looked at [me] and he said, \"Son, what made you run for the Senate?\" And like a darn fool I told him the exact truth before I could think of it -- I said, \"civil rights, sir.\" And [as] soon as I did I could feel the beads of perspiration pop out of my head and get that funny feeling. He looked at me and said, \"Good, good, good.\" And that was the end of the conversation. Well -- Well, 18 years later, after us having shared a hospital suite for three months atWalter Reedand after him having tried to help me in another pursuit I had, we\\x92d become friends. I saw him sitting behind that same table 18 years later, only this time in a wheelchair. His leg had been amputated because of cancer. And I was going to look at offices because in my seniority his office was available as he was leaving. I went in and sat down and he looked at me as if it were yesterday and he said, \"Sit down, Joe, sit down,\" and tapped that chair. And he said something that startled me. He said, \"Remember the first time you came to see me, Joe?\" And I shook my head, I didn\\x92t remember. And he leaned forward and he recited the story. I said to him, \"I was a pretty smart young fellow, wasn\\x92t I, Mr. Chairman?\" He said, \"Joe, I wanted to tell you something then that I\\x92m going to tell you now. Ya\\'ll going to take my office, aren\\x92t you?\" And I said, \"Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.\" And he ran his hand back and forth across that mahogany table in a loving way, and he said, \"You see this table, Joe?\" This is the God\\x92s truth. He said, \"You see this table?\" And I said, \"Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.\" He said, \"This table was the flagship of the Confederacy from 1954 to 1968.\" He said, \"We sat here, most of us from the Deep South, the old Confederacy, we planned the demise of the civil rights movement.\" Then he looked at me and said, \"And now it\\x92s time, it\\x92s time that this table go from the possession of a man against civil rights to a man who is for civil rights.\" And I was stunned. And he said, \"One more thing, Joe,\" he said. \"The civil rights movement did more to free the white man than the black man.\" And I looked at him, I didn\\x92t know what he meant. And he said in only John Stennis fashion, he said, \"It freed my soul; it freed my soul.\" Strom Thurmond\\x92s soul is free today. His soul is free. The Bible says, Learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now and let us reason together [saith the Lord]: though your sins may be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow....3 Strom, today there are no longer any issues to debate; there\\x92s only peace, a patch of common ground and the many memories that you\\x92ve left behind. For me, those memories are deeply personal, and they will stay with me as long as I live. Strom Thurmond stood by me when others didn\\x92t, and it was against -- when it was against his political interest to do so. I had beenaccused of something terrible, in my view, on the eve of theBork nomination. I gathered the entire Senate -- I was then chairman -- the entire Judiciary Committee, and I said to Democrats and Republicans alike, \"I will stand aside as chairman so it will not affect this proceeding.\" And the first man to jump to his feet was your father, and he said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Well, let me explain.\" He said, \"You don\\x92t have to explain anything to me. You\\x92re my chairman.\" And with that, everyonead seriatimstood up, but Strom Thurmond was the first man on his feet -- did not seek a single explanation for what I had been accused of. And clearly, when partisanship was a winning option, he chose friendship, and I\\x92ll never forget him for it. I was honored to work with him, privileged to serve with him, and proud to call him my friend. His long life may well have been a gift of his beloved God, but the powerful and lasting impact he had on his beloved South Carolina and on his nation is Strom\\x92s legacy, his gift to all of us. And he will be missed. The British essayistWilliam Hazlittonce wrote (quote): \"Death conceals4everything but truth, and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue.It\\x92s a sort of natural canonization.\"5 The truth and genius and virtue of Strom Thurmond is what I choose and we all choose to remember today. To Nancy, to Strom [Jr.], to Julie, and to Paul, to all his friends, to the people of South Carolina who knew him so well and loved him so much: America mourns with you. I mourn with you. For I knew Strom well. I felt his warmth as you did. I saw his strength as you did. I was the beneficiary of his virtues, as you were. And I\\x92ll miss him as you will, as we all will. But he lived a long and good life. And I know that today a benevolent God has lifted his arms to Strom. I just don\\x92t know what Strom is saying to that benevolent God, because you know he\\x92s saying something. So I say, Farewell, Mr. Chairman. We stand in adjournment until we meet again.',\n",
       " \"Thank you dear friends. \\r\\n\\t\\tThank you so very much for that warm welcome. You'd have to be me to \\r\\n\\t\\tknow how much you'd -- I appreciate it. I'm really honored to be here \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight. Dear friends, as you well \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, we meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that's hit the \\r\\n\\t\\tGulf Coast but that really hurts all of us, no matter where we live, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we are all members of our larger American family. Right? At times like this, we set \\r\\n\\t\\taside all that divides us and we come together to help our fellow \\r\\n\\t\\tAmericans in need. The last thing we think about is whether one of the \\r\\n\\t\\tvictims was a Democrat or a Republican, because we're all Americans. You \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, the sad truth is that it shouldn't take a hurricane to bring us \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether like this. Every day -- every day \\r\\n\\t\\tacross our country, millions of our fellow citizens are facing very big \\r\\n\\t\\tand real problems. They're worried about their homes and their jobs, \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir businesses. They're worried about the outrageous cost of gasoline \\r\\n\\t\\tand health insurance. And they are worried about the threats from our \\r\\n\\t\\tenemies abroad. But when they look to \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington, all too often they don't see their leaders coming together \\r\\n\\t\\tto tackle these problems. Instead, they see Democrats and Republicans \\r\\n\\t\\tfighting each other rather than fighting for the American people. I don't have to tell you \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we were blessed in this country to have a great generation of \\r\\n\\t\\tfounders, and they foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless \\r\\n\\t\\tpartisanship. In fact, our first president, George Washington, in his \\r\\n\\t\\tfarewell dress -- address, warned that the spirit of party could be the \\r\\n\\t\\tworst enemy of our democracy and enfeeble our government's ability to do \\r\\n\\t\\tits job. My friends, I think tonight \\r\\n\\t\\twe could say that President Washington was absolutely right. The truth \\r\\n\\t\\tis, today we are living through his worst nightmare in the capital city \\r\\n\\t\\tthat bears his name. And that brings me directly \\r\\n\\t\\tto why I'm here tonight. What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at \\r\\n\\t\\ta Republican convention like this? Well, I'll tell you what. \\r\\n\\t\\tI'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party. I am here tonight for a \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple reason. John McCain is the best choice to bring our country \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether and lead America forward. And dear friends, I am here \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight because John McCain's whole life testifies to a great truth. \\r\\n\\t\\tBeing a Democrat or a Republican is important, but it is nowhere near as \\r\\n\\t\\timportant as being an American. I think you know that both \\r\\n\\t\\tof the presidential candidates this year have talked about changing the \\r\\n\\t\\tculture of Washington, about breaking through partisan gridlock and the \\r\\n\\t\\tspecial interests that are poisoning our politics. But my friends, only \\r\\n\\t\\tone of them has actually done it. Only one of them has shown the courage \\r\\n\\t\\tand the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get \\r\\n\\t\\tbig things done for our country and our people, and that one is John S. \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain. You know John, and you know \\r\\n\\t\\tthat he understands that it shouldn't take a natural disaster like a \\r\\n\\t\\thurricane to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together \\r\\n\\t\\tto get things done. It shouldn't take a natural disaster to teach us \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the American people really don't care much if you have an R or a D \\r\\n\\t\\tafter your name. What they care about is, are we solving the problems \\r\\n\\t\\tthat they're against every day? Let me tell you, what you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan expect from John McCain as president is precisely what he's done \\r\\n\\t\\tthis week: put our country first. That -- that's not -- that's \\r\\n\\t\\tnot a political posture by John; that's the code by which he has lived \\r\\n\\t\\this entire life. And that is the code that he will carry with him into \\r\\n\\t\\tthe White House next January. Now, let me tell you that \\r\\n\\t\\tI've had the privilege of serving with John for almost 20 years and the \\r\\n\\t\\thonor of becoming a dear friend of his. I have personally seen him over \\r\\n\\t\\tand over again bringing people together, from both parties, to tackle \\r\\n\\t\\tour toughest problems -- for example, to reform our campaign finance \\r\\n\\t\\tlaws, our lobbying and ethics laws, to create the independent 9/11 \\r\\n\\t\\tcommission after that great natural -- that great unnatural disaster \\r\\n\\t\\tcaused by the terrorists, and then to work to pass the national security \\r\\n\\t\\treforms that have made every American safer since then. And then he \\r\\n\\t\\tworked together to end the partisan paralysis over nominations to the \\r\\n\\t\\tSupreme Court and other federal courts. This is the record. Now, let me -- let me share \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething with you that I'm in a unique position to do as a Democrat. My Democratic friends know \\r\\n\\t\\tall about John's record of independence and accomplishment. And you see, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat's why I think some of them are spending so much time and so much \\r\\n\\t\\tmoney trying to convince the American people that John McCain is someone \\r\\n\\t\\telse. I am here to tell you what I \\r\\n\\t\\tthink you know, but I want to speak to the people out there. Don't be \\r\\n\\t\\tfooled by some of these political statements and advertisements. Trust \\r\\n\\t\\tme. God only made one John McCain and he is his own man. Let me -- let me, as John \\r\\n\\t\\twould say, give you some straight talk here. If John McCain was just \\r\\n\\t\\tanother go-along partisan politician, he never would have taken on \\r\\n\\t\\tcorrupt Republican lobbyists or big corporations that were cheating the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican people or powerful colleagues in Congress who were wasting \\r\\n\\t\\ttaxpayer money, but he did. If John McCain was another go-along partisan \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitician, he never would have led the fight to fix our broken \\r\\n\\t\\timmigration system or actually do something about global warming, but he \\r\\n\\t\\tdid. As a matter of fact, \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends, if John McCain is just another partisan Republican, then I'm \\r\\n\\t\\tMichael Moore's favorite Democrat. And I'm not. And I think you know \\r\\n\\t\\tthat I'm not. Senator Barack Obama is a \\r\\n\\t\\tgifted and eloquent young man who I think can do great things for our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry in the years ahead. But my friends, eloquence is \\r\\n\\t\\tno substitute for a record, not in these tough times for America. In the -- in the Senate, \\r\\n\\t\\tduring the three-and-a-half years that Senator Obama's been a member, he \\r\\n\\t\\thas not reached across party lines to accomplish anything significant, \\r\\n\\t\\tnor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocratic Party to get something done. And I just ask you to contrast \\r\\n\\t\\tthat with John McCain's record of independence and bipartisanship. But let me go one further -- \\r\\n\\t\\tand this may make history here at this Republican Convention. Let me -- \\r\\n\\t\\tlet me contrast Barack Obama's record to the record of the \\r\\n\\t\\tlast Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who stood up to some of those \\r\\n\\t\\tsame Democratic interest groups, worked with Republicans, and got some \\r\\n\\t\\timportant things done like welfare reform, free trade agreements and a \\r\\n\\t\\tbalanced budget. Now I'm honored to say just \\r\\n\\t\\ta word about the great lady that John McCain has selected as his running \\r\\n\\t\\tmate. Governor Palin, like John McCain, is a \\r\\n\\t\\treformer. She's taken on the special interests and the political power \\r\\n\\t\\tbrokers in Alaska, and reached across party lines to get things done. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe truth is, she is a leader we can count on to help John shake up \\r\\n\\t\\tWashington. That's why -- that's why I \\r\\n\\t\\tsincerely believe that the real ticket for change this year is the \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain-Palin ticket. Let me tell you, friends, \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the Washington bureaucrats and the power brokers are not going to \\r\\n\\t\\tbe able to build a pen that will hold in these two mavericks. It's just \\r\\n\\t\\tnot possible. Together, I think we can count on John \\r\\n\\t\\tand Sarah to fight for America and to fight for you, the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople. And that's what our country needs most right now. We all know it; these are \\r\\n\\t\\ttough times here at home, and we have dangerous enemies in the world. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd what America needs now, frankly, is not more party unity; what we \\r\\n\\t\\tneed now is more national unity. And this is especially true, \\r\\n\\t\\tof course, because we are a nation at war. We need a president we can \\r\\n\\t\\tcount on to fight for what's right for our country not only when it's \\r\\n\\t\\teasy, but when it's hard. And I was there, so I can tell you, when \\r\\n\\t\\tothers were silent about the war in Iraq, John McCain had the guts and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in \\r\\n\\t\\tIraq. You know, when others wanted to retreat in defeat from \\r\\n\\t\\tthe field of battle, which would have been a disaster for the USA; when \\r\\n\\t\\tcolleagues like Barack Obama were voting to cut off funding for our \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican troops on the battlefield -- John McCain had the \\r\\n\\t\\tcourage to stand against the tide of public opinion, advocate the sure, \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport the surge. And because of that, today, \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica's troops are coming home, thousands of them, and they're coming \\r\\n\\t\\thome in honor. My friends, I have had the \\r\\n\\t\\tprivilege and I'd say the pleasure of traveling the world with John \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain. Even with Lindsey Graham, it was a pleasure. When I speak of \\r\\n\\t\\tJohn and I say that I can tell you from these travels how much he's \\r\\n\\t\\trespected and admired and liked by leaders across the globe -- John \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain will be a president our allies will trust and our enemies will \\r\\n\\t\\tfear, and that's the kind of president we need in today's world. My friends, before I \\r\\n\\t\\tconclude, I want to ask the indulgence of all of you here in this hall \\r\\n\\t\\ttonight, because I want to speak directly to my fellow Democrats and \\r\\n\\t\\tindependents who are watching or listening tonight. I want to speak \\r\\n\\t\\tdirectly to you out there. I know many of you are angry and frustrated \\r\\n\\t\\tby our government and our politics today, and for good reason. You may be thinking of \\r\\n\\t\\tvoting for John McCain, but you're not sure yet. Some of you may never \\r\\n\\t\\thave voted for a Republican before and, frankly, in an ordinary \\r\\n\\t\\telection, you probably never would. But I want you to believe with me \\r\\n\\t\\tthat this is no ordinary election -- because -- \\r\\n\\t\\tand it's no ordinary election because these are not ordinary times. And, \\r\\n\\t\\ttrust me, John McCain is no ordinary candidate. You may not agree with John \\r\\n\\t\\tMcCain on every issue, but you can always count on him to be straight \\r\\n\\t\\twith you about where he stands, and to stand for what he thinks is right \\r\\n\\t\\tfor our country regardless of the politics. I can tell you with a \\r\\n\\t\\tcertain faith that, as president, you can count on John McCain to be \\r\\n\\t\\twhat he is naturally -- a restless reformer who will clean up Washington \\r\\n\\t\\tand get our government working again for all of the American people. So tonight, I want to ask \\r\\n\\t\\tyou whether you are an independent, a Reagan Democrat, a Clinton \\r\\n\\t\\tDemocrat or just a plain old Democrat, this year, when you vote for \\r\\n\\t\\tpresident, vote for the person you believe is best for the country, not \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the party you happen to belong to. I ask those of you who are \\r\\n\\t\\twatching or listening: Vote for the leader who since the age of 17, when \\r\\n\\t\\the first raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our \\r\\n\\t\\tConstitution, has always put America first. My friends, I appeal to \\r\\n\\t\\tindependents, Democrats and Republicans. Let's come together this \\r\\n\\t\\tNovember to make a great American patriot, John McCain, our next great \\r\\n\\t\\tpresident. Thank you, God bless you, \\r\\n\\t\\tand God bless America.\",\n",
       " 'Thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou very much. I will be making some forward-looking \\r\\n\\t\\tstatements since \\x93future\\x94 is in the title of my talk. It doesn\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tnecessarily mean I\\x92m advocating them or that I am optimistic. It means \\r\\n\\t\\tthat in order to do engineering long-term planning, you need to think \\r\\n\\t\\tabout -- and cautionary tales are in order --\\xa0 like building a cathedral, you \\r\\n\\t\\tmight have to plan a century in advance.  This is my conflict of interest slide. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92m highly conflicted. But it\\x92s also this: It\\x92s a set of \\r\\n\\t\\tinstitutions, both non-profit and for profit, that help us bring our \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology into reality, into daily life.  These are some of the topics we\\x92ll \\r\\n\\t\\ttalk [about], mainly the top three, which is this idea of synthetic versus \\r\\n\\t\\tnatural, prediction, and where we stand in terms ofhuman genome \\r\\n\\t\\tengineering. We have a love affair with the idea of the \\x93natural\\x94 even \\r\\n\\t\\tthough we as a species are about as unnatural as you can imagine.  I\\x92ll mention four diseases. There is \\r\\n\\t\\tdiabetes and heart disease to which we succumb due to natural compounds \\r\\n\\t\\tsuch as sucrose and cholesterol.  And the sourc[es] of carcinogens are \\r\\n\\t\\trobust in nature. We get on the order of 1500 milligrams a day of plant \\r\\n\\t\\ttoxins and pesticides that are listed as rodent carcinogens. That\\x92s the \\r\\n\\t\\tcancer side. And the infectious disease side is there are many instances \\r\\n\\t\\twhere infectious agents are spread through vegetables and meats.  We have a huge difference of intention \\r\\n\\t\\tand obsession with risks. The risks of genetically modified foods are \\r\\n\\t\\tnot well-documented. The risks of driving a car are very \\r\\n\\t\\twell-documented, 1.2 million deaths a year.\\xa0My laboratory and my \\r\\n\\t\\tobsession is about safety and building/engineering safety. It\\x92s not just \\r\\n\\t\\ta matter of saying we want the world to be safer; we have to create \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology. And here are some of technologies that we use for \\r\\n\\t\\tautomobiles. It doesn\\x92t sound like we\\x92ve done our job entirely \\r\\n\\t\\tif there are still 1.2 million deaths a year. But these are [the] sort of \\r\\n\\t\\tthings that inspire us to do better in a variety of engineering fields, \\r\\n\\t\\tincluding genomics engineering which is what we are talking about here.  We have standards in testing in \\r\\n\\t\\tbiology. Increasingly, we have these redundant systems and \\r\\n\\t\\tisolation that we\\x92re using: physical, genetic and metabolic. I have \\r\\n\\t\\tadvocated that we do extensive education, licensing and surveillance \\r\\n\\t\\tsince 2004; in particular, in the field of synthetic biology.\\xa0Since the \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology is getting exponentially less expensive, more able to engage \\r\\n\\t\\tthe public through \\x93do-it-yourself biology,\\x94 I felt then and feel now \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we need to have better and better tools for tracking the \\r\\n\\t\\tdissemination of the information, the chemicals and the instruments.  Here\\x92s just a snapshot from the \\r\\n\\t\\ttrenches in the laboratory. We\\x92re trying to address what it is that \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople want when they say that they want genetically engineered \\r\\n\\t\\torganisms that do not spread in the wild. This is one of the many \\r\\n\\t\\tcritiques of genetically modified organisms. And this is one attempt \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we\\x92ve recently published where we make them genetically isolated, \\r\\n\\t\\tmetabolically isolated, even if they -- whether or not they\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tphysically isolated from the environment, they cannot exchange genetic \\r\\n\\t\\tmaterial successfully.  So let\\x92s talk about prediction.  These were forward-looking statements \\r\\n\\t\\twhere\\xa0The New York Times -- I had nothing against The New York \\r\\n\\t\\tTimes, Amy -- butback in 1903 they made the modest predictionthat \\r\\n\\t\\tthere would be 1 to 10 million years, a nice, broad range, for a flying \\r\\n\\t\\tmachine. And even Wilbur Wright, who was much closer to the event than \\r\\n\\t\\tthe New York Times perhaps, was off by about 48 years in his estimate. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd so we make such mistakes -- and even within my fields of computing and \\r\\n\\t\\tbiology.  We have these two trend lines, sometimes \\r\\n\\t\\tcalledMoore\\x92s law. It\\x92s not really a law; \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s a trend. It could deviate from the line at any point. The blue \\r\\n\\t\\tline which is various biological things, sequencing and synthesis, \\r\\n\\t\\treading and writing DNA -- it followed the electronics Moore\\x92s law line at \\r\\n\\t\\tabout 1.5 fold per year for many years and so it seemed like, \\x93Wow, this \\r\\n\\t\\tmust really be a law that\\x92s totally general, biology and electronics.\\x94 But then we blew it and we went way off \\r\\n\\t\\tthe reservation and it took not six decades to bring us down to an \\r\\n\\t\\taffordable genome, but more like six years. So we\\x92re down around a \\r\\n\\t\\tthousand dollar cost. We don\\x92t yet have a thousand dollars that you can go out and individually get genomes, but it\\x92s at bulk rate \\r\\n\\t\\tthat\\x92s where we are right now, which I think is cost effective today, \\r\\n\\t\\tfor a variety of things.  Kevin Kelleydocumented how long it takes for \\r\\n\\t\\tnew technologies in general,this includes crossbows and so forth, to be \\r\\n\\t\\tbanned and then the ban to be released. It\\x92s almost inevitable that \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnologies, really dangerous technologies like \\r\\n\\t\\trailroads and automobiles, would be controversial. But the time that it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\ttaking before they become uncontroversial is shrinking. This isn\\x92t to \\r\\n\\t\\tsay that we shouldn\\x92t have controversy in discussion. It\\x92s just where \\r\\n\\t\\tare we going. It\\x92s to describe where we\\x92re going.  Now these are three types of \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnologies that I was intimately involved in. Each one of them had \\r\\n\\t\\tsome sort of controversy and some sort of response. So, controversy \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing the bold one, and then the response; and I\\x92m making the very casual, \\r\\n\\t\\tnot well-documented argument that in some cases these were not \\r\\n\\t\\tdeterrents to progress. They were good conversations that, if anything, \\r\\n\\t\\taccelerated the field. So, theRecombinant DNAwas sort of 1974, got a \\r\\n\\t\\tlot of attention -- covers ofTimemagazineand things \\r\\n\\t\\tlike that; and almost instantly,Genentech,Biogen,Amgenand a variety \\r\\n\\t\\tof other Biotechs got investors, because investors said, \\x93Oh, it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tcontroversial, there must be something here. Let\\x92s take a closer look.\\x94 A similar thing happened in 1991, where \\r\\n\\t\\ttheNIHactually started the controversy by patenting a lot of cDNAs \\r\\n\\t\\tthatCraig Venter\\x92s group had done back when he had a small NIH lab.1And \\r\\n\\t\\tthe lawyers had just said, \\x93This is what we do. We patent things that \\r\\n\\t\\tcome out of the NIH labs.\\x94 And then people said, \\x93Well, you can\\x92t patent \\r\\n\\t\\tcDNAs. You haven\\x92t added much value to it. They\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\tnatural pieces of DNA.\\x94 We now see that cDNAs are patentable, but I would \\r\\n\\t\\targue that there wasn\\x92t much value added to these. And the controversy \\r\\n\\t\\tresulted in a great deal of attention and almost immediately that \\r\\n\\t\\tresearch moved out of NIH toHuman Genome Sciences and Genome \\r\\n\\t\\tTherapeutics, a company that I was helping out getting early DNA \\r\\n\\t\\tsequencing going. Human embryonic stem \\r\\n\\t\\tcell[s]. There are lots of restrictions in the United States, especially. \\r\\n\\t\\tThis resulted in -- I can\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\tsay for sure but I doubt that California would\\'ve coughed up quite that \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch money if there had not been that much controversy and frustration \\r\\n\\t\\tamong the California biologists -- and they sort of saw this as an \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity to redo -- to do another Silicon Valley, to make \"Stem Cell \\r\\n\\t\\tValley,\" and then there are these various successes.  Now augmentation is \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething [that] often comes up with genetics. And we all put aside all the \\r\\n\\t\\taugmentations we\\x92ve made that make us unnatural as a species. We\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\tan extremely unnatural species. We have -- ignore all the numbers; they\\x92re \\r\\n\\t\\ta little bit out of alignment, but the point is we have senses that go \\r\\n\\t\\tover much broader range than they used to; our ability to \\r\\n\\t\\taccess/retrieve information is vast because [of] our computers and our \\r\\n\\t\\tcell phones (access to them); we can go at vast speeds into space, into \\r\\n\\t\\tthe depths of the ocean, and so forth. And you can see, many of these \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnologies take a fairly short time, not just through the interdiction \\r\\n\\t\\tprocess but just through the cost curve, to get broadly distributed -- not \\r\\n\\t\\talways in the optimal way, obviously here is transportation and cell phones, but \\r\\n\\t\\tthe point is they can have a huge impact and they can be commoditized \\r\\n\\t\\tworldwide, where you can have microfinancing, and where people get \\r\\n\\t\\thuge benefit from fairly modest access to electronics.  So, are we genetically engineering \\r\\n\\t\\thuman beings? And the answer is, \\x93definitely.\\x94 We\\x92ve been doing it for quite \\r\\n\\t\\ta while. And this is a summary of where we stand in terms of \\r\\n\\t\\tgene therapy trials; which is one of various ways that we are modifying \\r\\n\\t\\thuman beings. These are, for the most part, adults. There are some of these \\r\\n\\t\\t[that] are \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren. And there are Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials. There\\x92s one that\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen approved in Europe calledGlybera. It is, right now, the most \\r\\n\\t\\texpensive pharmaceutical ever, at 1.6 million dollars per dose. But as orphan \\r\\n\\t\\tdrugs go, that\\x92s actually about right because you only need one dose, \\r\\n\\t\\tand it shows a general acceptance of this kind of human genetic \\r\\n\\t\\tmodification in Europe, which has a reputation for being \\r\\n\\t\\tskeptical about such things. And it has to do with the seriousness of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe diseases that are being treated. So, the key here is not so much \\r\\n\\t\\tethics as safety and efficacy; it\\x92s the standard by which the Food and \\r\\n\\t\\tDrug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency go by, if it\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tsafe and very effective and is addressing the real problem.  Now, the most extreme and interesting \\r\\n\\t\\tform of those 2,000 or so genetic therapies that are in clinical trials, \\r\\n\\t\\tto me, is this highly targeted gene therapy. Most of those on that \\r\\n\\t\\tprevious slide are adding a gene, compensating for [a] missing gene, a complete loss of function. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd so you can add it pretty much \\r\\n\\t\\tanywhere. You can integrate it randomly, which has certain risks \\r\\n\\t\\tassociated, or you can \\x93not integrate\\x94 it, but it\\x92s adding. But you can \\r\\n\\t\\talso subtract or you can specifically modify. You can useendonucleasesthat are programmable. That is to say, you can target them to find a \\r\\n\\t\\tneedle in a hay stack, that one base pair out of six billion in your genome \\r\\n\\t\\tthat you want to change. And in this case, this the \\r\\n\\t\\tearliest of these that\\x92s making it through clinical trials.Sangamois \\r\\n\\t\\tin sort of Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical trials. And you delete or damage \\r\\n\\t\\tboth copies ofCCR5gene and you end up in -- with theT-cellsfrom the person. \\r\\n\\t\\tYou can take them out of the person, manipulate them, and put them back \\r\\n\\t\\tin. That means there\\x92ll be no graft rejection, no need for immunosuppressants. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd they have now, the ones that have taken up this zinc \\r\\n\\t\\tfinger nuclease, this specific targeted in the nuclease, those cells -- \\r\\n\\t\\tthose T-cells -- that have been doubly knocked out of the CCR5 gene are now \\r\\n\\t\\tresistant to the AIDS virus. And this could be done in patients that \\r\\n\\t\\talready have full blown AIDS.\\xa0And so again, this is a very promising \\r\\n\\t\\tfor very severe diseases.  We have a project to study \\r\\n\\t\\tpersonalized medicine in its broadest sense, ranging from carrier \\r\\n\\t\\tstatus, new-born screening -- all aspects of modern human genetics that works \\r\\n\\t\\tquite well to new personalized medicines that includemicrobiomics2and \\r\\n\\t\\tcomplicated multi-factors. To get this multi-factor data set, this large \\r\\n\\t\\tdata set about individual people, not about cohorts but really N-of-one, \\r\\n\\t\\tlots of N-of-one studies, we have this open-access data that requires \\r\\n\\t\\tconsent that shows that people really know what they\\x92re getting into in \\r\\n\\t\\tterms of the possibility -- the probability that their data will be publicly available. We \\r\\n\\t\\thave stem cells for many of these individuals and a variety of tests \\r\\n\\t\\tthat can be done.  The sort of stem cells that come out of this are a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle piece of theBRAIN Initiative-- that you heard just a moment ago \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\twhere you can take these stem cells, reprogram them into neurons, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthen they can have this kind of neurophysiology and it could be done in \\r\\n\\t\\tvery short developmental time frames.\\xa0So we\\x92re getting to the point \\r\\n\\t\\t-- \\r\\n\\t\\tanother kind of \\x93brave new world\\x94 issue -- where we can not only manipulate \\r\\n\\t\\thuman genomes but we can manipulate human brains. We can either program \\r\\n\\t\\tthemin situwith these innovative neurotechnologies, or we can \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild brains outside of the body and get this kind of spiking behavior \\r\\n\\t\\ton neural nets.  This BRAIN Initiative was partially instigated by this \\r\\n\\t\\tgroup of six people that I was part of in 2012. And it\\x92s really \\r\\n\\t\\tremarkable how quickly it went from that semi obscure, forward-looking \\r\\n\\t\\tpiece inNeuron(the journal) to anannouncement by Barack Obamathat we \\r\\n\\t\\thad a BRAIN Initiative. I mentioned nucleases that you can \\r\\n\\t\\ttarget -- you can program to find a needle in a hay stack of the human \\r\\n\\t\\tgenome or other genomes.  There are a variety of ways of making these \\r\\n\\t\\tnucleases, very specifically, but they can be targeted not just in the \\r\\n\\t\\thuman genome, but into wild genomes. We know that we\\x92re releasing \\r\\n\\t\\tgenetically modified organisms into the wild for crops, for plants. \\r\\n\\t\\tThere are a few animals that are being released in the wild; for exampleOxitecis releasingAedes aegyptimosquitoes which have been \\r\\n\\t\\tengineered to be essentially like males that have been sterilized by radiation, \\r\\n\\t\\tbut in this case they been sterilized by genetics. That seems like a \\r\\n\\t\\tfairly safe thing since the males don\\x92t suck blood and they are sterile. \\r\\n\\t\\tIt\\x92s a special case but you can see that the communities are warming up \\r\\n\\t\\tto the idea of releasing plants and animals into the environment.  This \\r\\n\\t\\twould be the most extreme form of that and as a consequenceKevin Esvelt,Andie Smidler,Flaminia Catterucciaand I published three papers \\r\\n\\t\\tvery recently laying out this new form of gene drives. The basic idea \\r\\n\\t\\tgoes back toAustin Burt in 2003at least. But this is \\r\\n\\t\\taCRISPR-based gene \\r\\n\\t\\tdrive that\\x92s so much easier, probably, to do and might be something \\r\\n\\t\\tworthy of a cautionary tale -- something worthy of being very thoughtful \\r\\n\\t\\tabout, because it is so enticing and because it is so easy to do that \\r\\n\\t\\teven individuals might be able to do it.\\xa0So now is the time to talk about it \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore we go much further.  Now since we\\'ve published these papers, we\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\talready now done it -- experiments on gene drives (this not published) \\r\\n\\t\\tin yeast -- we\\x92ve done it in yeast because they have such a rapid \\r\\n\\t\\tgeneration time. This method is directed at sexual transmission where \\r\\n\\t\\tyou can correct spread at a desired package through a wild population \\r\\n\\t\\tor, in this case, a laboratory population exponentially so all the \\r\\n\\t\\toffspring have it. And the experiment in yeast, it\\x92s been close to a \\r\\n\\t\\thundred percent. This is kind of the simple version of how it spreads \\r\\n\\t\\t[or it\\x92s spread]. This is decidedly not like theGregor Mendel peasthat we saw a few \\r\\n\\t\\tslides ago, inPaul\\x92s [Lombardo] talk. This is something where, essentially, you \\r\\n\\t\\tintroduce one or a few mosquitoes into the population that have the gene \\r\\n\\t\\tdrive and it spreads exponentially to all of their offspring and all of \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir offspring\\x92s subsequent matings until it is throughout the \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation; and it can spread packages such as resistance of the \\r\\n\\t\\tmosquito to malaria. So you\\x92re not actually hurting the mosquito but \\r\\n\\t\\tyou\\x92re making them so they no longer can be vectors for malaria; or you \\r\\n\\t\\tcould make it so that you only get transmission of the Y chromosome, in \\r\\n\\t\\twhich case you eventually result in decrease in the mosquito \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation.  This is a little more \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnical of what\\'s happening behind the scenes, but you basically have \\r\\n\\t\\tthe blue \\r\\n\\t\\tcassette in the upper left that is on one chromosome in one specific \\r\\n\\t\\tposition. So this is selfish DNA. It\\x92s not DNA that is wildly \\r\\n\\t\\treplicating all over every chromosome -- hence, producing a huge burden on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe mosquito or whatever species you\\x92re dealing with, whether invasive \\r\\n\\t\\tor vector species. But it\\x92s in one place, in one chromosome that you\\x92ve \\r\\n\\t\\tdecided is the best place. And then, when in the embryo, if it finds that same \\r\\n\\t\\tplace in the chromosome from the other parent is different -- doesn\\x92t have \\r\\n\\t\\tthe cassette -- then we\\'ll move the cassette over into that by making a cut \\r\\n\\t\\t-- makes a double strand break -- and the cassette moves into it; and now \\r\\n\\t\\tyou either have both copies, (all the copies) of that particular \\r\\n\\t\\tchromosome looking the same, or perhaps you\\x92ve mutated. Either way, all \\r\\n\\t\\tthe offspring that survive have the cassette that you want.  And forget the details of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis, but the important thing is there are very sophisticated things you \\r\\n\\t\\tcould do with this new technology -- this CRISPR technology -- that allows \\r\\n\\t\\tyou to be very specific -- target sub-species -- so you have not only the \\r\\n\\t\\tspecies\\x92 mating behavior and geographical barriers but you have this \\r\\n\\t\\tgenomic barrier that you can engineer so that you can make sure that the \\r\\n\\t\\tcutting is efficient and specific and even sub-species specific. You \\r\\n\\t\\tcan do immunization either against gene drives or against natural \\r\\n\\t\\tcomponents like viruses; and you can even make reversal drives. I will make the argument that we are \\r\\n\\t\\tpoorly adapted to our current environment. I mean, we did not evolve to \\r\\n\\t\\tsit all day and be exposed to giant amounts of really tasty food. And there \\r\\n\\t\\tare various opportunities that we have which I would -- certainly \\r\\n\\t\\t[they\\'re] not eugenics and they\\x92re not even augmentation in \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we\\x92re dealing with diseases of civilization. They are augmentations \\r\\n\\t\\tin a certain sense in that we\\'re putting things into our medicines or \\r\\n\\t\\tour gene therapies that deal with things we wouldn\\x92t have had to deal with in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe past, but we respond to these in an emergency attitude because they \\r\\n\\t\\tare life‑threatening.  This changes again when we go into new environments and our \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilization keeps pushing itself into new places such as space.\\xa0 In \\r\\n\\t\\tspace, we have problems with osteoporosis due to the lack of gravity. We \\r\\n\\t\\thave extreme radiation problems. Now some of these have corresponding \\r\\n\\t\\tproblems on earth. There are problems with the inner ear. There are \\r\\n\\t\\tproblems with special stresses that occur there and so forth.  When we deal with these situations we \\r\\n\\t\\tworry about multigenics. That is to say, how can we possibly understand \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething as complicated as height when there are now 700 genes that \\r\\n\\t\\taffect it and they have very tiny affect sizes? What\\x92s important -- and \\r\\n\\t\\tyou find it from projects like thePersonal Genome Project, where you can \\r\\n\\t\\tcorrelate traits with genomes -- is looking at the extremes. We talked \\r\\n\\t\\tabout the bell curve. This is a different kind of bell curve where you \\r\\n\\t\\tlook\\xa0way out at the shortest and the tallest people as an example of \\r\\n\\t\\tmany different traits, both medical and non-medical. And you see, out at \\r\\n\\t\\tthose extremes, you get things that are calledepistatic genes-- variants \\r\\n\\t\\tthat are so powerful that they dominate, epistatically, all of those \\r\\n\\t\\tsmall effects, including some small environmental effects, some small \\r\\n\\t\\tgenetic effects, and these suggest cures as well, or treatments that will \\r\\n\\t\\tinfluence these very complex genetic and environmental traits.  So if you \\r\\n\\t\\tgive growth hormone to a young person, maybe even at an age where growth \\r\\n\\t\\tshould be stopping, growth will continue and their stature will approach \\r\\n\\t\\twhatever stature goal they\\x92ve had. So this is an example of something \\r\\n\\t\\twhere you can have what looks like a very complex genetics with fairly \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple consequences -- not that anything about medicine is simple.  You \\r\\n\\t\\twill often have cases where you have one person on the planet at any \\r\\n\\t\\tgiven moment, where you\\x92ve learned that you don\\x92t have huge statistics \\r\\n\\t\\there. You have a cohort size of one. Nevertheless, you can prove \\r\\n\\t\\tcausality by making animal models in some cases;\\xa0some cases making human in vitro organ \\r\\n\\t\\tmodels. And these you can consider rare protective alleles.3These are \\r\\n\\t\\tthings like, in this case,myostatin. You get a double \\x93null,\\x94 meaning \\r\\n\\t\\tmissing both copies. And more or less at birth this child had a high \\r\\n\\t\\tmusculature, as you can see reflected in the animal models.  And there \\r\\n\\t\\tare many of these. None of these are \\r\\n\\t\\tunmitigated -- protective variants that have no down side -- but they have \\r\\n\\t\\tinteresting possibilities. Some of these I mentioned in the context of \\r\\n\\t\\timagining that they could be useful to deal with diseases of \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilization or new environments such as space. So, for example, there are LRP variants. This is a heterozygote, which have extra strong bones -- \\r\\n\\t\\tor I mentioned growth hormone. You might want to have smaller people in \\r\\n\\t\\tspace; you have insensitivity to pain; you have -- odor might be a \\r\\n\\t\\tproblem in space; you can have multi-virus resistance, low coronary \\r\\n\\t\\tdisease, and so forth. These are floating around our population. Many of \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, minus over minuses, are double nulls. These are genes that are \\r\\n\\t\\tconserved among all animals but they\\x92re missing in [some] human beings \\r\\n\\t\\tand they\\x92re not only alive, in many cases they are thriving.  A possibly \\r\\n\\t\\textreme example of this are people who live past 110 years. This slide \\r\\n\\t\\tis not an advocacy of smoking and drinking to excess, but the point is \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\x92s probably not solely that they have a great environment. They may \\r\\n\\t\\tactually have some exceptional genes and so we\\x92re studying their genomes \\r\\n\\t\\tand trying to test hypotheses about them.  Wrapping up here, as we go \\r\\n\\t\\tinto space we need to study biospheres -- how our environment interacts \\r\\n\\t\\twith our genetics -- in more detail.  I\\x92ve already mentioned cosmic \\r\\n\\t\\tradiation.  There are organisms that are very distantly related to us, \\r\\n\\t\\tsuch are radiation resistant, and you might say how irrelevant can that \\r\\n\\t\\tpossibly be? How many mutations will that take? Well it turns out you \\r\\n\\t\\tcan change with as few as four mutations an organism to be a hundred \\r\\n\\t\\tthousand times more radiation resistant. Whether this applies to humans is \\r\\n\\t\\tstill unknown.  And I\\x92m just going to end this very \\r\\n\\t\\tplayful and speculative slide.\\xa0This is a typical operating room. We \\r\\n\\t\\twill have to make a decision, as we go into new environments outside of \\r\\n\\t\\tearth, whether we want to drag along with us all our pathogens. We can or we can\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\t-- it\\x92s up to us -- but I consider that part of genome \\r\\n\\t\\tengineering is how we interact with the huge part of our genome which \\r\\n\\t\\tis our microbiome. And I\\x92ve mentioned that there are people \\r\\n\\t\\tthat have insensitivity to pain. You can engineer this such that it \\r\\n\\t\\tcould be turned on and off, and so rather than going into general \\r\\n\\t\\tanesthesia with its risks, or opiate-type analgesics, you could have \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething like this. So I thank you, and time for questions, I \\r\\n\\t\\thope.',\n",
       " \"Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0It\\x92s great to be here.\\xa0 It\\x92s great to be here. Hey, Debbie. Ladies and gentlemen, oh, what a difference 40 years makes.\\xa0 I look out there and see an old friend, Annette Lantos.\\xa0 Annette, how are you?\\xa0 Her husband, Tom Lantos, a survivor, was my assistant, was my foreign policy advisor for years.\\xa0 And Tom used to say all the time, Joe -- he talked with that Hungarian accent -- he\\x92d say, Joe, we must do another fundraiser for AIPAC.\\xa0 I did more fundraisers for AIPAC in the \\x9170s and early \\x9180s than -- just about as many as anybody.\\xa0 Thank God you weren\\x92t putting on shows like this, we would have never made it.\\xa0 We would have never made it. My Lord, it\\x92s so great to be with you all and great to see -- Mr. President, thank you so much for that kind introduction.\\xa0 And President-elect Bob Cohen, the entire AIPAC Board of Directors, I\\x92m delighted to be with you today.\\xa0 But I\\x92m particularly delighted to be with an old friend -- and he is an old friend; we use that phrase lightly in Washington, but it\\x92s real, and I think he\\x92d even tell you -- Ehud Barak, it\\x92s great to be with you, Mr. Minister.\\xa0 Great to be with you. There is a standup guy.\\xa0 There is a standup guy.\\xa0 Standing up for his country, putting his life on the line for his country, and continuing to defend the values that we all share.\\xa0 I\\x92m a fan of the man.\\xa0 Thanks for being here, Ehud.\\xa0 It\\x92s good to be with you again. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of you know me if you\\x92re old enough.\\xa0 Some of you don\\x92t know me, and understand I can\\x92t see now, but in the bleachers to either side, I\\x92m told you have 2,000 young AIPAC members here.\\xa0 We talked about this a lot over the years.\\xa0 We talked about it a lot:\\xa0 This is the lifeblood.\\xa0 This is the connective tissue.\\xa0 This is the reason why no American will ever forget.\\xa0 You\\x92ve got to keep raising them. Ladies and gentlemen, we\\x92ve stood shoulder to shoulder, a lot of us in this auditorium, defending the legitimate interest of Israel and our enduring commitment over the last 40 years.\\xa0 And many of you in this hall -- I won\\x92t start to name them, but many of you in this hall, starting with Annette Lantos\\x92s husband, who is not here, God rest his soul -- many of you in this hall have been my teachers, my mentors and my educators, and that is not hyperbole.\\xa0 You literally have been. But my education started, as some of you know, at my father\\x92s dinner table.\\xa0 My father was what you would have called a righteous Christian.\\xa0 We gathered at my dinner table to have conversation, and incidentally eat, as we were growing up.\\xa0 It was a table -- it was at that table I first heard the phrase that is overused sometimes today, but in a sense not used meaningfully enough -- first I heard the phrase, \\x93Never again.\\x94 It was at that table that I learned that the only way to ensure that it could never happen again was the establishment and the existence of a secure, Jewish state of Israel.\\xa0 I remember my father, a Christian, being baffled at the debate taking place at the end of World War II talking about it.\\xa0 I don\\x92t remember it at that time, but about how there could be a debate about whether or not -- within the community, of whether or not to establish the State of Israel. My father would say, were he a Jew, he would never, never entrust the security of his people to any individual nation, no matter how good and how noble it was, like the United States.\\xa0 Everybody knows it\\x92s real.\\xa0 But I want you to know one thing, which some of you -- I\\x92ve met with a lot of you over the last 40 years, but the last four years as well.\\xa0 President Obama shares my commitment.\\xa0 We both know that Israel faces new threats, new pressures and uncertainty.\\xa0 The Defense Minister and I have discussed it often.\\xa0 In the area of national security, the threats to Israel\\x92s existence continue, but they have changed as the world and the region have changed over the last decade. The Arab Spring, at once full of both hope and uncertainty, has required Israel -- and the United States -- to reassess old and settled relationships.\\xa0 Iran\\x92s dangerous nuclear weapons program, and its continued support of terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah and Hamas, not only endanger Israel, but endanger the world.\\xa0 Attempts of much of the world to isolate and delegitimize the State of Israel are increasingly common, and taken as the norm in other parts of the world. All these pressures are similar but different, and they put enormous pressure on the State of Israel.\\xa0 We understand that.\\xa0 And we especially understand that if we make a mistake, it\\x92s not a threat to our existence.\\xa0 But if Israel makes a mistake, it could be a threat to its very existence.\\xa0 And that\\x92s why, from the moment the President took office, he has acted swiftly and decisively to make clear to the whole world and to Israel that even as circumstances have changed, one thing has not:\\xa0 our deep commitment to the security of the state of Israel.\\xa0 That has not changed.\\xa0 That will not change as long as I and he are President and Vice President of the United States.\\xa0 It\\x92s in our naked self-interest, beyond the moral imperative. And to all of you, I thank you for continuing to remind the nation and the world of that commitment.\\xa0 And while we may not always agree on tactics -- and I\\x92ve been around a long time; I\\x92ve been there for a lot of prime ministers -- we\\x92ve always disagreed on tactic.\\xa0 We\\x92ve always disagreed at some point or another on tactic.\\xa0 But, ladies and gentlemen, we have never disagreed on the strategic imperative that Israel must be able to protect its own, must be able to do it on its own, and we must always stand with Israel to be sure that can happen.\\xa0 And we will. That\\x92s why we\\x92ve worked so hard to make sure Israel keeps its qualitative edge in the midst of the Great Recession.\\xa0 I\\x92ve served with eight Presidents of the United States of America, and I can assure you, unequivocally, no President has done as much to physically secure the State of Israel as President Barack Obama. President Obama last year requested $3.1 billion in military assistance for Israel -- the most in history.\\xa0 He has directed close coordination, strategically and operationally, between our government and our Israeli partners, including our political, military and intelligence leadership. I can say with certitude, in the last eight Presidents, I don\\x92t know any time, Ehud, when there has been as many meetings, as much coordination, between our intelligence services and our military.\\xa0 Matter of fact, they\\x92re getting tired of traveling back across the ocean, I think. Under this administration, we\\x92ve held the most regular and largest-ever joint military exercises.\\xa0 We\\x92ve invested $275 million in Iron Dome, including $70 million that the President directed to be spent last year on an urgent basis -- to increase the production of Iron Dome batteries and interceptors. Not long ago, I would have had to describe to an audience what Iron Dome was, how it would work, why funding it mattered.\\xa0 I don\\x92t have to explain to anybody anymore.\\xa0 Everybody gets it.\\xa0 Everybody saw -- the world saw firsthand why it was and remains so critical. For too long, when those sirens blared in the streets of the cities bordering Gaza, the only defense had been a bomb shelter.\\xa0 But late last year, Iron Dome made a difference.\\xa0 When Hamas rockets rained on Israel, Iron Dome shot them out of the sky, intercepting nearly 400 rockets in November alone.\\xa0 It was our unique partnership -- Israel and the United States -- that pioneered this technology and funded it. And it is in that same spirit that we\\x92re working with Israel to jointly develop new systems, called Arrow and David\\x92s Sling, interceptors that can defeat long-range threats from Iran, Syria and Hezbollah -- equally as urgent.\\xa0 And we are working to deploy a powerful new radar, networked with American early warning satellites, that could buy Israel valuable time in the event of an attack.\\xa0 This is what we do.\\xa0 This is what we do to ensure Israel can counter and defeat any threat from any corner. But that\\x92s only the first piece of this equation.\\xa0 Let me tell you -- and I expect I share the view of many of you who have been involved with AIPAC for a long time.\\xa0 Let me tell you what worries me the most today -- what worries me more than at any time in the 40 years I\\x92ve been engaged, and it is different than any time in my career.\\xa0 And that is the wholesale, seemingly coordinated effort to delegitimize Israel as a Jewish state.\\xa0 That is the single most dangerous, pernicious change that has taken place, in my humble opinion, since I\\x92ve been engaged. And, ladies and gentlemen, it matters.\\xa0 It matters.\\xa0 To put it bluntly, there is only one nation -- only one nation in the world that has unequivocally, without hesitation and consistently confronted the efforts to delegitimize Israel.\\xa0 At every point in our administration, at every juncture, we\\x92ve stood up on the legitimacy -- on behalf of legitimacy of the State of Israel.\\xa0 President Obama has been a bulwark against those insidious efforts at every step of the way. Wherever he goes in the world, he makes clear that although we want better relations with Muslim-majority countries, Israel\\x92s legitimacy and our support for it is not a matter of debate.\\xa0 There is no light.\\xa0 It is not a matter of debate.\\xa0 It\\x92s simple, and he means it:\\xa0 It is not a matter of debated.\\xa0 Don't raise it with us.\\xa0 Do not raise it with us.\\xa0 It is not negotiable. As recently as last year, the only country on the United Nations Human Rights Council to vote against -- I think it\\x92s 36 countries, don't hold me to the exact number -- but the only country on the Human Rights Council of the United Nations to vote against the establishment of a fact-finding mission on settlements was the United States of America. We opposed the unilateral efforts of the Palestinian Authority to circumvent direct negotiations by pushing for statehood and multilateral organizations like UNESCO.\\xa0 We stood strongly with Israel in its right to defend itself after the Goldstone Report was issued in 2009.\\xa0 While the rest of the world, including some of our good friend, was prepared to embrace the report, we came out straightforwardly, expressed our concerns and with recommendations. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the Gaza flotilla in 2010, I was in Africa.\\xa0 We spent a lot of time on the phone, Ehud and -- the Defense Minister and I.\\xa0 And Bibi and I spent a lot time on that phone with my interceding, going to the United Nations directly by telephone, speaking with the Secretary General, making sure that one thing was made clear, Israel had the right -- had the right -- to impose that blockade. Ladies and gentlemen, that's why we refuse to attend events such as the 10th anniversary of the 2001 World Conference on Racism that shamefully equated Zionism with racism.\\xa0\\xa0 That's why we rejected anti-Semitic rhetoric from any corner and from leaders of any nation.\\xa0 And that's why I\\x92m proud to say my friend, the new Secretary of State, John Kerry, spoke out against the kind of language in Ankara just this Friday.\\xa0By the way, he\\x92s a good man.\\xa0 You're going to be happy with Kerry. And it was in the strongest terms that we vigorously opposed the Palestinian bid for nonmember observer status in the General Assembly, and we will continue to oppose any effort to establish a state of Palestine through unilateral actions. There is no shortcut to peace.\\xa0 There is no shortcut to face-to-face negotiations.\\xa0 There is no shortcut to guarantees made looking in the eyes of the other party. Ladies and gentlemen, Israel's own leaders currently understand the imperative of peace.\\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, President Peres -- they've all called for a two-state solution and an absolute secure, democratic and Jewish State of Israel; to live side by side with an independent Palestinian state.\\xa0 But it takes two to tango, and the rest of the Arab world has to get in the game. We are under no illusions about how difficult it will be to achieve.\\xa0 Even some of you in the audience said, why do we even talk about it anymore?\\xa0 Well, it's going to require hard steps on both sides.\\xa0 But it's in all of our interests -- Israel's interest, the United States' interest, the interest of the Palestinian people.\\xa0 We all have a profound interest in peace.\\xa0 To use an expression of a former President, Bill Clinton, we've got to get caught trying.\\xa0 We've got to get caught trying. So we remain deeply engaged.\\xa0 As President Obama has said, while there are those who question whether this goal may ever be reached, we make no apologies for continuing to pursue that goal, to pursue a better future.\\xa0 And he'll make that clear when he goes to Israel later this month. We're also mindful that pursuing a better future for Israel means helping Israel confront the myriads of threat it faces in the neighborhood.\\xa0 It's a tough neighborhood, and it starts with Iran.\\xa0 It is not only in Israel's interest -- and everybody should understand -- I know you understand this, but the world should -- it's not only in Israel's interest that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, it's in the interest of the United States of America.\\xa0 It's simple.\\xa0 And, as a matter of fact, it's in the interest of the entire world. Iraq's [sic] acquisition of a nuclear weapon not only would present an existential threat to Israel, it would present a threat to our allies and our partners -- and to the United States.\\xa0 And it would trigger an arms race -- a nuclear arms race in the region, and make the world a whole lot less stable. So we have a shared strategic commitment.\\xa0 Let me make clear what that commitment is:\\xa0 It is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\\xa0 Period.\\xa0 End of discussion.\\xa0 Prevent -- not contain -- prevent. The President has flatly stated that.\\xa0 And as many of you in this room have heard me say -- and he always kids me about this; we'll be in the security room -- and I know that Debbie Wasserman Schultz knows this because she hears it -- he always says, you know -- he'll turn to other people and say, as Joe would say, he\\x92s -- as Joe would say, big nations can't bluff.\\xa0 Well, big nations can't bluff.\\xa0 And Presidents of the United States cannot and do not bluff.\\xa0 And President Barack Obama is not bluffing.\\xa0 He is not bluffing. We are not looking for war.\\xa0 We are looking to and ready to negotiate peacefully, but all options, including military force, are on the table.\\xa0 But as I made clear at the Munich Security Conference just last month, our strong preference, the world\\x92s preference is for a diplomatic solution.\\xa0 So while that window is closing, we believe there is still time and space to achieve the outcome.\\xa0 We are in constant dialogue, sharing information with the Israeli military, the Israeli intelligence service, the Israeli political establishment at every level, and we\\x92re taking all the steps required to get there. But I want to make clear to you something.\\xa0 If, God forbid, the need to act occurs, it is critically important for the whole world to know we did everything in our power, we did everything that reasonably could have been expected to avoid any confrontation.\\xa0 And that matters.\\xa0 Because God forbid, if we have to act, it\\x92s important that the rest of the world is with us.\\xa0 We have a united international community.\\xa0 We have a united international community behind these unprecedented sanctions. We have left Iran more isolated than ever.\\xa0 When we came to office, as you remember -- not because of the last administration, just a reality -- Iran was on the ascendency in the region.\\xa0 It is no longer on the ascendency.\\xa0 The purpose of this pressure is not to punish.\\xa0 It is to convince Iran to make good on its international obligations.\\xa0 Put simply, we are sharpening a choice that the Iranian leadership has to make.\\xa0 They can meet their obligations and give the international community ironclad confidence in the peaceful nature of their program, or they can continue down the path they\\x92re on to further isolate and mounting pressure of the world. But even preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon still leaves them a dangerous neighbor, particularly to Israel.\\xa0 They are using terrorist proxies to spread violence in the region and beyond the region, putting Israelis, Americans, citizens of every continent in danger.\\xa0 For too long, Hezbollah has tried to pose as nothing more than a political and social welfare group, while plotting against innocents in Eastern Europe -- from Eastern Europe to East Africa; from Southeast Asia to South America.\\xa0 We know what Israel knows:\\xa0 Hezbollah is a terrorist organization.\\xa0 Period.\\xa0 And we -- and me -- we are urging every nation in the world that we deal with -- and we deal with them all -- to start treating Hezbollah as such, and naming them as a terrorist organization. This isn\\x92t just about a threat to Israel and the United States.\\xa0 It\\x92s about a global terrorist organization that has targeted people on several continents.\\xa0 We\\x92ll say and we\\x92ll do our part to stop them.\\xa0 And we ask the world to do the same.\\xa0 That\\x92s why we\\x92ve been talking to our friends in Europe to forcefully declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\\xa0 This past month I\\x92ve made the case to leading European heads of state, as Barack and Israelis know, together we have to continue to confront Hezbollah wherever it shows -- sews the seeds of hatred and stands against the nations that sponsor campaigns of terror. Ladies and gentlemen, the United States and Israel have a shared interest in Syria as well.\\xa0 Assad has shown his father\\x92s disregard for human life and dignity, engaging in brutal murder of his own citizens.\\xa0 Our position on that tragedy could not be clearer:\\xa0 Assad must go.\\xa0 But we are not signing up for one murderous gang replacing another in Damascus. That\\x92s why our focus is on supporting a legitimate opposition not only committed to a peaceful Syria but to a peaceful region.\\xa0 That\\x92s why we\\x92re carefully vetting those to whom we provide assistance.\\xa0 That\\x92s why, while putting relentless pressure on Assad and sanctioning the pro-regime, Iranian-backed militia, we\\x92ve also designated al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization. And because we recognize the great danger Assad\\x92s chemical and biological arsenals pose to Israel and the United States, to the whole world, we\\x92ve set a clear red line against the use of the transfer of the those weapons.\\xa0 And we will work together to prevent this conflict and these horrific weapons from threatening Israel\\x92s security.\\xa0 And while we try to ensure an end to the dictatorship in Syria, we have supported and will support a genuine transition to Egyptian democracy. We have no illusions -- we know how difficult this will be and how difficult it is.\\xa0 There\\x92s been -- obviously been a dramatic change in Egypt.\\xa0 A lot of it has given us hope and a lot of it has given us pause, and a lot of it has caused fears in other quarters. It\\x92s not about us, but it profoundly affects us.\\xa0 We need to be invested in Egypt\\x92s success and stability.\\xa0 The stable success of Egypt will translate into a stable region.\\xa0 We\\x92re not looking at what\\x92s happening in Egypt through rose-colored glasses.\\xa0 Again, our eyes are wide open.\\xa0 We have no illusions about the challenges that we face, but we also know this:\\xa0 There\\x92s no legitimate alternative at this point to engagement. Only through engagement -- it\\x92s only through engagement with Egypt that we can focus Egypt\\x92s leaders on the need to repair international obligations -- respect their international obligations, including and especially its peace treaty with Israel.\\xa0 It\\x92s only through active engagement that we can help ensure that Hamas does not re-arm through the Sinai and put the people of Israel at risk.\\xa0 It\\x92s only through engagement that we can concentrate Egypt\\x92s government on the imperative of confronting the extremists.\\xa0 And it\\x92s only through engagement that we can encourage Egypt\\x92s leaders to make reforms that will spark economic growth and stabilize the democratic process.\\xa0 And it\\x92s all tough, and there\\x92s no certainty.\\xa0 There\\x92s no certainty about anything in the Arab Spring. I expect President Obama to cover each of these issues in much greater detail.\\xa0 I\\x92ve learned one thing, as I was telling the President, I learned it\\x92s never a good idea, Ehud, to steal the President\\x92s thunder.\\xa0 It\\x92s never a good idea to say what he\\x92s going to say the next day.\\xa0 So I\\x92m not going to go into any further detail on this.\\xa0 But in much greater detail he will discuss this when he goes to Israel later this month, just before Passover begins. I have to admit I\\x92m a little jealous that he gets to be the one to say \\x93this year in Jerusalem,\\x94 but I\\x92m the Vice President.\\xa0 I\\x92m not the President.\\xa0So I -- when I told him that, I\\x92m not sure he thought I was serious or not.\\xa0 But anyway. As will come as no surprise to you, the President and I not only are partners, we\\x92ve become friends, and he and I have spoken at length about this trip.\\xa0 And I can assure you he\\x92s particularly looking forward to having a chance to hear directly from the people of Israel and beyond their political leaders, and particularly the younger generation of Israelis. And I must note just as I\\x92m getting a chance to speak to 2,000 young, American Jews involved and committed to the state of Israel and the relationship with the United States, he\\x92s as anxious to do what I got a chance to do when I was there last, Ehud with you, as you flew me along the line.\\xa0 I got to go to Tel Aviv University to speak several thousand young Israelis.\\xa0 The vibrancy, the optimism, the absolute commitment is contagious, and he\\x92s looking forward to seeing it and feeling it and tasting it. The President looks forward to having conversations about their hopes and their aspirations, about their astonishing world-leading technological achievements, about the future they envision for themselves and for their country, about how different the world they face is from the one their parents faced, even if many of the threats are the same. These are really important conversations for the President to have and to hear and for them to hear.\\xa0 These are critically important.\\xa0 I get kidded, again to quote Debbie, she kids sometimes, everybody quotes -- Democrat and Republican -- quotes Tip O\\x92Neill saying, all politics is local.\\xa0 With all due respect, Lonny, I think that's not right.\\xa0 I think all politics is personal.\\xa0 And I mean it:\\xa0 All politics is personal.\\xa0 And it\\x92s building personal relationships and trust and exposure, talking to people that really matters, particularly in foreign policy. So, ladies and gentlemen, let me end where I began, by reaffirming our commitment to the State of Israel.\\xa0 It\\x92s not only a longstanding, moral commitment, it\\x92s a strategic commitment.\\xa0 An independent Israel, secure in its own borders, recognized by the world is in the practical, strategic interests of the United States of America.\\xa0 I used to say when I -- Lonny was president -- I used to say if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. Ladies and gentlemen, we also know that it's critical to remind every generation of Americans -- as you're doing with your children here today, it's critical to remind our children, my children, your children.\\xa0 That's why the first time I ever took the three of my children separately to Europe, the first place I took them was Dachau.\\xa0 We flew to Munich and went to Dachau -- the first thing we ever did as Annette will remember -- because it's important that all our children and grandchildren understand that this is a never-ending requirement.\\xa0 The preservation of an independent Jewish state is the ultimate guarantor, it's the only certain guarantor of freedom and security for the Jewish people in the world. That was most pointedly pointed out to me when I was a young senator making my first trip to Israel.\\xa0 I had the great, great honor -- and that is not hyperbole -- of getting to meet for the first time -- and subsequently, I met her beyond that -- Golda Meir.\\xa0 She was the prime minister. Now, I'm sure every kid up there said, you can't be that old, Senator.\\xa0 I hope that's what you're saying.\\xa0 But seriously, the first trip I ever made -- and you all know those double doors.\\xa0 You just go into the office and the blonde furniture and the desk on the left side, if memory serves me correctly.\\xa0 And Golda Meir, as a prime minister and as a defense minister, she had those maps behind her.\\xa0 You could pull down all those maps like you had in geography class in high school. And she sat behind her desk.\\xa0 And I sat in a chair in front of her desk, and a young man was sitting to my right who was her assistant.\\xa0 His name was Yitzhak Rabin.\\xa0 Seriously -- an absolutely true story.\\xa0 And she sat there chain-smoking and reading letters to me, letters from the front from the Six-Day War.\\xa0 She read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and this is their family.\\xa0 This went on for I don't know how long, and I guess she could tell I was visibly moved by this, and I was getting depressed about it -- oh, my God. And she suddenly looked at me and said -- and I give you my word as a Biden that she looked at me and said -- she said, Senator, would you like a photo opportunity?\\xa0 And I looked at her.\\xa0 I said, well yes, Madam Prime Minister.\\xa0 I mean I was -- and we walk out those doors.\\xa0 We stood there -- no statements, and we're standing next to one another looking at this array of media, television and photojournalists, take -- snapping pictures.\\xa0 And we're looking straight ahead. Without looking at me, she speaks to me.\\xa0 She said, Senator, don't look so sad.\\xa0 She said, we have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world.\\xa0 And I thought she was about to lean over and tell me about a new system or something.\\xa0 Because you can see the pictures, I still have them -- I turned to look at her.\\xa0 We were supposed to be looking straight ahead.\\xa0 And I said, Madam Prime Minister -- and never turned her head, she kept looking -- she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we have no place else to go.\\xa0 We have no place else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, our job is to make sure there's always a place to go, that there's always an Israel, that there's always a secure Israel and there's an Israel that can care for itself.\\xa0 My father was right.\\xa0 You are right.\\xa0 It's the ultimate guarantor of never again.\\xa0 God bless you all and may God protect our troops.\\xa0 Thank you.\",\n",
       " 'Thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. Thank you to Ambassador Alex Wolff and to our U.S. Mission here at \\r\\n\\t\\tthe United Nations. And it\\x92s wonderful to be back at the United Nations \\r\\n\\t\\tfor this occasion. I want to thank the deputy \\r\\n\\t\\tsecretary general for being with us. I\\x92m very pleased that my friend and \\r\\n\\t\\tsomeone who once represented the United States here before becoming \\r\\n\\t\\tSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright, could join us; members of the \\r\\n\\t\\tdiplomatic corps and representatives to the United Nations Commission on \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Status of Women; many of my friends, elected officials from New \\r\\n\\t\\tYork, including Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who has been recognized \\r\\n\\t\\tand who is a great champion of women\\x92s rights and responsibilities -- and \\r\\n\\t\\tto all of you. This final day of the 54thsession of the UN \\r\\n\\t\\tCommission brings to a close a week of a lot of activity, and it reminds \\r\\n\\t\\tus of the work that still lies ahead. Fifteen years ago, delegates \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom 189 countries met in Beijing for the Fourth World Conference on \\r\\n\\t\\tWomen. It wasa call to action-- a call to the global community to work \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the laws, reforms, and social changes necessary to ensure that women \\r\\n\\t\\tand girls everywhere finally have the opportunities they deserve to \\r\\n\\t\\tfulfill their own God-given potentials and contribute fully to the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress and prosperity of their societies. For many of us in this room \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday, that was a call to action that we have heeded. I know some of you \\r\\n\\t\\thave made it the cause of your life. You have worked tirelessly, day in \\r\\n\\t\\tand day out, to translate those words into realities. And we have seen \\r\\n\\t\\tthe evidence of such efforts everywhere. In South Africa, women \\r\\n\\t\\tliving in shanty towns came together to build a housing development \\r\\n\\t\\toutside Cape Town all on their own, brick by brick. And today, their \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunity has grown to more than 50,000 homes for low income families, \\r\\n\\t\\tmost of them female-headed. In Liberia, a group of \\r\\n\\t\\tchurch women began a prayer movement to stop their country\\x92s brutal \\r\\n\\t\\tcivil war. It grew to include thousands of women who helped force the \\r\\n\\t\\ttwo sides to negotiate a peace agreement. And then, those women helped \\r\\n\\t\\telect Ellen Johnson Sirleaf president, the first woman to lead an \\r\\n\\t\\tAfrican nation. In the United States, a \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung woman had an idea for a website where anyone could help a small \\r\\n\\t\\tbusiness on the other side of the world get off the ground. And today, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe organization she co-founded, Kiva, has given more than $120 million \\r\\n\\t\\tin microloans to entrepreneurs in developing countries, 80 percent of \\r\\n\\t\\tthem women. So as we meet here in New \\r\\n\\t\\tYork, women worldwide are working hard to do their part to improve the \\r\\n\\t\\tstatus of women and girls. And in so doing, they are also improving the \\r\\n\\t\\tstatus of families, communities, and countries. They are running \\r\\n\\t\\tdomestic violence shelters and fighting human trafficking. They are \\r\\n\\t\\trescuing girls from brothels in Cambodia and campaigning for public \\r\\n\\t\\toffice in Kuwait. They are healing women injured in childbirth in \\r\\n\\t\\tEthiopia, providing legal aid to women in China, and running schools for \\r\\n\\t\\trefugees from Burma. They are rebuilding homes and re-stitching \\r\\n\\t\\tcommunities in the aftermath of the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthey are literally leaving their marks on the world. For example, thanks \\r\\n\\t\\tto the environmental movement started by Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai, \\r\\n\\t\\t45 million trees are now standing tall across Kenya, most of them \\r\\n\\t\\tplanted by women. And even young girls have \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen empowered to stand up for their rights in ways that were once \\r\\n\\t\\tunthinkable. In Yemen, a 10-year-old girl forced to marry a much older \\r\\n\\t\\tman made headlines around the world by marching into court and demanding \\r\\n\\t\\tthat she be granted a divorce, which she received. And her courage \\r\\n\\t\\thelped to shine a spotlight on the continuing practice of child marriage \\r\\n\\t\\tin that country and elsewhere. Now, these are just a few of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe stories, and everyone here could stand up and tell even more. These \\r\\n\\t\\tare the stories of what women around the world do every day to confront \\r\\n\\t\\tinjustice, to solve crises, propel economies, improve living conditions, \\r\\n\\t\\tand promote peace. Women have shown time and again that they will seize \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities to improve their own and their families\\x92 lives. And even \\r\\n\\t\\twhen it seems that no opportunity exists, they still find a way. And \\r\\n\\t\\tthanks to the hard work and persistence of women and men, we have made \\r\\n\\t\\treal gains toward meeting the goals set in Beijing. Today, more girls are in \\r\\n\\t\\tschool. More women hold jobs and serve in public office. And as women \\r\\n\\t\\thave gained the chance to work, learn, and participate in their \\r\\n\\t\\tsocieties, their economic, political, and social contributions have \\r\\n\\t\\tmultiplied. In many countries, laws that once permitted the unequal \\r\\n\\t\\ttreatment of women have been replaced by laws that recognize their \\r\\n\\t\\tequality, although for too many, laws that exist on the books are not \\r\\n\\t\\tyet borne out in their daily lives. But the progress we have \\r\\n\\t\\tmade in the past 15 years is by no means the end of the story. It is, \\r\\n\\t\\tmaybe, if we\\x92re really lucky, the end of the beginning. There is still \\r\\n\\t\\tso much more to be done. We have to write the next chapter to fully \\r\\n\\t\\trealize the dreams and potential that we set forth in Beijing. Because \\r\\n\\t\\tfor too many millions and millions of girls and women, opportunity \\r\\n\\t\\tremains out of reach. Women are still the majority of the world\\x92s poor, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe uneducated, the unhealthy, the unfed. In too many places, women are \\r\\n\\t\\ttreated not as full and equal human beings with their own rights and \\r\\n\\t\\taspirations, but as lesser creatures undeserving of the treatment and \\r\\n\\t\\trespect accorded to their husbands, their fathers, and their sons. Women are the majority of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world\\x92s farmers, but are often forbidden from owning the land they \\r\\n\\t\\ttend to every day, or accessing the credit they need to invest in those \\r\\n\\t\\tfarms and make them more productive. Women care for the world\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tsick, but women and girls are less likely to get treatment when they are \\r\\n\\t\\tsick. Women raise the world\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tchildren, but too often receive inadequate care when they give birth. \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd as a result, childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury \\r\\n\\t\\tto women worldwide. Women rarely cause armed \\r\\n\\t\\tconflicts, but they always suffer their consequences. And when warring \\r\\n\\t\\tsides sit at one table to negotiate peace, women are often excluded, \\r\\n\\t\\teven though it is their future and their children\\x92s future that is being \\r\\n\\t\\tdecided. Though many countries have \\r\\n\\t\\tpassed laws to deter violence against women, it remains a global \\r\\n\\t\\tpandemic. Women and girls are bought and sold to settle debts and \\r\\n\\t\\tresolve disputes. They are raped as both a tactic and a prize of armed \\r\\n\\t\\tconflict. They are beaten as punishment for disobedience and as a \\r\\n\\t\\twarning to other women who might assert their rights. And millions of \\r\\n\\t\\twomen and girls are enslaved in brothels, forced to work as prostitutes, \\r\\n\\t\\twhile police officers pocket bribes and look the other way. Women may be particularly \\r\\n\\t\\tvulnerable to human rights violations like these. But we also know that \\r\\n\\t\\tin many places, women now are leading the fight to protect and promote \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights for everyone. With us today are several women I was proud \\r\\n\\t\\tto honor earlier this week at this year\\x92s United States State \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment\\x92s International Women of Courage Awards. They have endured \\r\\n\\t\\tisolation and intimidation, violence and imprisonment, and even risked \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir lives to advance justice and freedom for others. And though they \\r\\n\\t\\tmay work in lonely circumstances, these women, and those like them \\r\\n\\t\\taround the world, are not alone. Let them know that every one of us and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe many others whom we represent are standing with them as they wage \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir lonely but essential efforts on behalf of us all. The status of the world\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\twomen is not only a matter of morality and justice. It is also a \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical, economic, and social imperative. Put simply, the world cannot \\r\\n\\t\\tmake lasting progress if women and girls in the 21stcentury \\r\\n\\t\\tare denied their rights and left behind. The other day I heardThe \\r\\n\\t\\tNew York Timescolumnist Nick Kristof, who has done so much to bring \\r\\n\\t\\tto a wide audience the stories of individual women who are working and \\r\\n\\t\\tsuffering because of conditions under which they are oppressed. And he \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid, you know, in the 19thcentury, the great moral \\r\\n\\t\\timperative was the fight against slavery. And in the 20thcentury, it was the fight against totalitarianism. And in the 21stcentury, it is the fight for women\\x92s equality. He was right, and we must \\r\\n\\t\\taccept -- and promote that fundamental truth. Now, I know there are those \\r\\n\\t\\t-- hard to believe -- but there are those who still dispute the importance \\r\\n\\t\\tof women to local, national, and global progress. But the evidence is \\r\\n\\t\\tirrefutable. When women are free to develop their talents, all people \\r\\n\\t\\tbenefit: women and men, girls and boys. When women are free to vote and \\r\\n\\t\\trun for public office, governments are more effective and responsive to \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir people. When women are free to earn a living and start small \\r\\n\\t\\tbusinesses, the data is clear: they become key drivers of economic \\r\\n\\t\\tgrowth across regions and sectors. When women are given the opportunity \\r\\n\\t\\tof education and access to health care, their families and communities \\r\\n\\t\\tprosper. And when women have equal rights, nations are more stable, \\r\\n\\t\\tpeaceful, and secure. In 1995, in one voice, the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld declared human rights are women\\x92s rights and women\\x92s rights are \\r\\n\\t\\thuman rights. And for many, those words have translated into concrete \\r\\n\\t\\tactions. But for others they remain a distant aspiration. Change on a \\r\\n\\t\\tglobal scale cannot and does not happen overnight. It takes time, \\r\\n\\t\\tpatience, and persistence. And as hard as we have worked these past 15 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, we have more work to do. So today, let us renew our \\r\\n\\t\\tcommitment to finishing the job. And let us intensify our efforts \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause it is both the right thing to do and it is the smart thing as \\r\\n\\t\\twell. We must declare with one voice thatwomen\\x92s progress is human \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress, and human progress is women\\x92s progressonce and for all. This principle was enshrined \\r\\n\\t\\t10 years ago in Millennium Development Goal Number 3, the promotion of \\r\\n\\t\\tgender equality and the empowerment of women. And that goal is essential \\r\\n\\t\\tfor the realization of every other goal. Today, this principle is also \\r\\n\\t\\tat the heart of the foreign policy of the United States. We believe that \\r\\n\\t\\twomen are critical to solving virtually every challenge we face as \\r\\n\\t\\tindividual nations and as a community of nations. Strategies that ignore \\r\\n\\t\\tthe lives and contributions of women have little chance of succeeding. \\r\\n\\t\\tSo in the Obama Administration, we are integrating women throughout our \\r\\n\\t\\twork around the world. We are consulting with women \\r\\n\\t\\tas we design and implement our policies. We are taking into greater \\r\\n\\t\\taccount how those policies will impact women and girls. And we are \\r\\n\\t\\tworking to identify women leaders and potential leaders around the world \\r\\n\\t\\tto make them our partners and to help support their work. And we are \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasuring progress, in part, by how much we improve the conditions of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe lives of women and girls. This isn\\x92t window dressing, \\r\\n\\t\\tand it\\x92s not just good politics. President Obama and I believe that the \\r\\n\\t\\tsubjugation of women is a threat to the national security of the United \\r\\n\\t\\tStates. It is also a threat to the common security of our world, because \\r\\n\\t\\tthe suffering and denial of the rights of women and the instability of \\r\\n\\t\\tnations go hand in hand. The United States is \\r\\n\\t\\timplementing this approach in our strategy in Afghanistan. As I said in \\r\\n\\t\\tLondon in January at the International Conference on Afghanistan, the \\r\\n\\t\\twomen of Afghanistan have to be involved at every step in securing and \\r\\n\\t\\trebuilding their country. Our stabilization strategy for both \\r\\n\\t\\tAfghanistan and Pakistan includes a Women\\x92s Action Plan that promotes \\r\\n\\t\\twomen\\x92s leadership in both the public and private sectors; increases \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir access to education, health, and justice; and generates jobs for \\r\\n\\t\\twomen, especially in agriculture. This focus on women has even \\r\\n\\t\\tbeen embraced by the United States Military. All-women teams of Marines \\r\\n\\t\\twill be meeting with Afghan women in their homes to assess their needs. \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress has joined this focus as well. The Senate Foreign Relations \\r\\n\\t\\tCommittee, under Chairman John Kerry, empowered a subcommittee charged \\r\\n\\t\\twith global women\\x92s issues that recently held hearings on promoting \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity for Afghan women and girls. History has taught us that \\r\\n\\t\\tany peace not built by and for women is far less likely to deliver real \\r\\n\\t\\tand lasting benefits. As we have seen from Guatemala to Northern Ireland \\r\\n\\t\\tto Bosnia, women can be powerful peacemakers, willing to reach across \\r\\n\\t\\tdeep divides to find common ground. United Nations Security Council \\r\\n\\t\\tResolution 1325 reflects this principle. Now, we must work together to \\r\\n\\t\\trender it into action and achieve the full participation of women as \\r\\n\\t\\tequal partners in peace. And as women continue to advocate for peace, \\r\\n\\t\\teven risking their lives to achieve it, many are praying that we will \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep the promise we made in Resolution 1888 to take significant steps to \\r\\n\\t\\tend sexual violence against women and children in conflict. We have begun the process \\r\\n\\t\\tlaid out in the resolution. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has appointed \\r\\n\\t\\ta special representative. Now we must press ahead to end forever the \\r\\n\\t\\tevil of rape in conflict, which has caused suffering beyond imagination \\r\\n\\t\\tfor victims and their families. For the United States, women \\r\\n\\t\\tare also central to our ongoing work to elevate development as a key \\r\\n\\t\\tpillar of our foreign policy alongside diplomacy and defense. As those \\r\\n\\t\\twho grow the world\\x92s food, collect the water, gather the firewood, wash \\r\\n\\t\\tthe clothes, and increasingly, work in the factories, run the shops, \\r\\n\\t\\tlaunch the businesses, and create jobs, women are powerful forces for \\r\\n\\t\\tany country\\x92s economic growth and social progress. So our development \\r\\n\\t\\tstrategies must reflect their roles and the benefits they bring. Three major foreign policy \\r\\n\\t\\tinitiatives illustrate our commitment. The first is our Global Health \\r\\n\\t\\tInitiative, a $63 billion commitment to improve health and strengthen \\r\\n\\t\\thealth systems worldwide. Improving global health is an enormous \\r\\n\\t\\tundertaking, so we are focusing first on those people whose health has \\r\\n\\t\\tthe biggest impact on families and communities -- women and girls. We aim \\r\\n\\t\\tto reduce maternal and child mortality and increase access to family \\r\\n\\t\\tplanning. And we especially commend the commission and the UN\\x92s adoption \\r\\n\\t\\tby consensus of the resolution on maternal mortality. We also -- intend to further \\r\\n\\t\\treduce the numbers of new HIV infections. AIDS has now become a woman\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tdisease, passed from men to women and too often, to children. Through \\r\\n\\t\\tour Global Health Initiative and our continued work through PEPFAR, we \\r\\n\\t\\thope to stop that deadly progression by giving women and girls the tools \\r\\n\\t\\tand knowledge they need to protect themselves, and by treating \\r\\n\\t\\tHIV-positive mothers so they are less likely to pass on the disease to \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir children. Our global food security \\r\\n\\t\\tprogram, which I previewed here at the United Nations last September, is \\r\\n\\t\\ta $3.5 billion commitment to strengthen the world\\x92s food supply, so \\r\\n\\t\\tfarmers can earn enough to support their families and food can be \\r\\n\\t\\tavailable more broadly. And women are integral to this mission. Most of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world\\x92s food is grown, harvested, stored, and prepared by women, \\r\\n\\t\\toften in extremely difficult conditions. They face droughts, floods, \\r\\n\\t\\tstorms, pests without the fertilizers or enriched seeds that farmers in \\r\\n\\t\\twealthy countries use. Many consider themselves lucky if they can \\r\\n\\t\\tscratch out a harvest sufficient to feed their children. Giving these \\r\\n\\t\\twomen the tools and the training to grow more food and the opportunity \\r\\n\\t\\tto get that food to a market where it can be sold will have a \\r\\n\\t\\ttransformative impact on their lives and it will grow the economies of \\r\\n\\t\\tso many countries. I have to confess that when \\r\\n\\t\\twe started our Food Security Initiative, I did not know that most food \\r\\n\\t\\twas grown by women. I remember once driving through Africa with a group \\r\\n\\t\\tof distinguished experts. And I saw women working in the fields and I \\r\\n\\t\\tsaw women working in the markets and I saw women with wood on their \\r\\n\\t\\theads and water on their heads and children on their backs. And I \\r\\n\\t\\tremarked that women just seem to be working all the time. And one of the \\r\\n\\t\\teconomists said, \\x93But it doesn\\x92t count.\\x94 I said, \\x93How can you say that?\\x94 \\r\\n\\t\\tHe said, \\x93Well, it\\x92s not part of the formal economy.\\x94 I said, \\x93Well, if \\r\\n\\t\\tevery woman who did all that work stopped tomorrow, the formal economy \\r\\n\\t\\twould collapse.\\x94 A third initiative is our \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment\\x92s response to the challenge of climate change. In Copenhagen \\r\\n\\t\\tin December, I announced that the United States would work with other \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate \\r\\n\\t\\tneeds of developing countries. The effects of climate \\r\\n\\t\\tchange will be felt by us all, but women in developing countries will be \\r\\n\\t\\tparticularly hard hit, because as all of the changes of weather go on to \\r\\n\\t\\tproduce more drought conditions and more storms and more floods, the \\r\\n\\t\\twomen will have to work even harder to produce food and walk even \\r\\n\\t\\tfarther to find water safe for drinking. They are on the front lines of \\r\\n\\t\\tthis crisis, which makes them key partners and problem solvers. So we \\r\\n\\t\\tbelieve we must increase women\\x92s access to adaptation and mitigation \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnologies and programs so they can protect their families and help us \\r\\n\\t\\tall meet this global challenge. These initiatives amount to \\r\\n\\t\\tmore than an assortment of programs designed with women in mind. They \\r\\n\\t\\treflect a fundamental shift in U.S. policy, one that is taking place in \\r\\n\\t\\toffices across Washington and in our embassies around the globe. But we \\r\\n\\t\\tare still called to do more -- every single one of us. The Obama \\r\\n\\t\\tAdministration will continue to work for the ratification of CEDAW. Now, I don\\x92t have to tell \\r\\n\\t\\tthose of you who are Americans how hard this is. But we are determined, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause we believe it is past time, to take this step for women in our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry and in all countries. Here at the United Nations, a single, \\r\\n\\t\\tvibrant agency dedicated to women -- run by a strong leader with a seat \\r\\n\\t\\tat the secretary general\\x92s table, would help galvanize the greater \\r\\n\\t\\tlevels of coordination and commitment that the women of the world \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserve. And as the United Nations \\r\\n\\t\\tstrives to better support the world\\x92s women, it would benefit from \\r\\n\\t\\thaving more women in more of its leadership positions. Just as there are \\r\\n\\t\\ttalented women working unnoticed in every corner of the world, there are \\r\\n\\t\\twomen with great talent and experience whose potential leadership is \\r\\n\\t\\tstill largely untapped, and they deserve the chance to serve and lead. The Beijing Declaration and \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Platform for Action was not only a pledge to help women in other \\r\\n\\t\\tlands, it was also a promise by all countries to do more to advance \\r\\n\\t\\topportunity and equality for our own citizens. Because in every country \\r\\n\\t\\ton earth, talent is universal, but opportunity is not. In my travels \\r\\n\\t\\tacross the United States, I\\x92ve met women for whom higher education is a \\r\\n\\t\\tdistant dream. They have the talent, they have the drive, but they don\\x92t \\r\\n\\t\\thave the money. I\\x92ve met mothers trapped in abusive relationships \\r\\n\\t\\tdesperate to escape with their children, but with no means of support. \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\x92ve met too many women who cannot afford necessary healthcare for \\r\\n\\t\\tthemselves and their children. And I\\x92ve met girls who have heard their \\r\\n\\t\\twhole lives that they were less than -- less talented, less worthy of \\r\\n\\t\\trespect -- until they eventually came to believe it was true. So whether we live in New \\r\\n\\t\\tYork or New Delhi, Lagos or La Paz, women and girls share many of the \\r\\n\\t\\tsame struggles and aspirations. The principle of women\\x92s equality is a \\r\\n\\t\\tsimple, self-evident truth, but the work of turning that principle into \\r\\n\\t\\tpractice is rarely simple. It takes years and even generations of \\r\\n\\t\\tpatient, persistent work, not only to change a country\\x92s laws, but to \\r\\n\\t\\tchange its people\\x92s minds, to weave throughout culture and tradition in \\r\\n\\t\\tpublic discourse and private views the unassailable fact of women\\x92s \\r\\n\\t\\tworth and women\\x92s rights. Some of you may have seen \\r\\n\\t\\tthe cover of the most recent issue ofThe Economist.If you \\r\\n\\t\\thaven\\x92t, I commend it to you. And like me, you may do a double-take. \\r\\n\\t\\tBecause I looked quickly at it and I thought it said \\x93genocide.\\x94 And \\r\\n\\t\\tthen I looked more carefully at it, and it said \\x93gendercide.\\x94 Because it \\r\\n\\t\\twas pointing out the uncomfortable fact that there are approximately 100 \\r\\n\\t\\tmillion fewer girls than there should be, if one looked at all the \\r\\n\\t\\tpopulation data. I was so struck by that: a word that I had never heard \\r\\n\\t\\tbefore, but which so tragically describes what has gone on, what we have \\r\\n\\t\\tlet go on, in our world. My daughter is here with me \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday -- and being the mother of a daughter is a great inspiration and \\r\\n\\t\\tmotivation for caring about the girls of the world. And I would hope \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we would want not only for our own daughters the opportunities that \\r\\n\\t\\twe know would give them the chance to make the most of their lives, to \\r\\n\\t\\tfulfill that God-given potential that resides within each of us, but \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we would recognize doing the same for other daughters of mothers \\r\\n\\t\\tand fathers everywhere would make the world a safer and better place for \\r\\n\\t\\tour own children. So we must measure our \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress not by what we say in great venues like this, but in how well \\r\\n\\t\\twe are able to improve the condition of women\\x92s lives, some near at hand \\r\\n\\t\\twho deserve the opportunities many of us take for granted, some in far \\r\\n\\t\\tdistant cities and remote villages -- women we are not likely ever to \\r\\n\\t\\tmeet but whose lives will be shaped by our actions. Let us recommit ourselves, \\r\\n\\t\\tas individuals, as nations, as the United Nations, to build upon the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress of the past and achieve once and for all that principle that we \\r\\n\\t\\tall believe in, or we would not be here today. The rights and \\r\\n\\t\\topportunities of all women and girls deserve our attention and our \\r\\n\\t\\tsupport because as they make progress, then the progress that should be \\r\\n\\t\\tthe birthright of future generations will be more likely, and the 21stcentury will fulfill the promise that we hold out today. So let\\x92s go \\r\\n\\t\\tforth and be reenergized in the work that lies ahead. Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " 'Well, good morning, and thank you all for \\r\\n\\t\\ttaking time to come and listen to us here. Again, this is a National Defense Strategy, but what it really is, \\r\\n\\t\\tladies and gentlemen, this is an American strategy.\\xa0 It belongs to you.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tYou own it.\\xa0 We work for you. And I would just tell you, Dean Lewis, it\\'s a pleasure for hosting me \\r\\n\\t\\there today.\\xa0 I owe you a great deal.\\xa0 It\\'s a pleasure to beat a schoolnamed for the gentleman that this one is named for,Paul Nitze.\\r\\n\\t\\tI would just tell you, he was so wise in how he could select people.\\xa0 He \\r\\n\\t\\tpicked a young man once and gave him a couch in his townhouse here in \\r\\n\\t\\ttown to help him when he first got into national security affairs.\\xa0 That \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung man he put on his couch was none other thanGeorge Shultz, which \\r\\n\\t\\tsays something about his ability to see talent at a young age. And there\\'s a lot of talent that comes through here and it looks very \\r\\n\\t\\tgood to me from this point of view.\\xa0 You all look like promising \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung men and women, because you\\'re all young compared to me. But he was also a great and avid scholar.\\xa0 He was someone who studied \\r\\n\\t\\tissues.\\xa0 You could agree or disagree with him but would not find him \\r\\n\\t\\tflat-footed intellectually. And I bring this up becauseNational Security Council Document or Report \\r\\n\\t\\t#68was a guiding light during the Cold War.\\xa0 It guided many things.\\r\\n\\t\\tWas it perfect in hindsight?\\xa0 No, it was not.\\xa0 We don\\'t look for \\r\\n\\t\\tperfection from you young people, we look for excellence.\\r\\n\\t\\tHe also served as our secretary of the Navy, so we do have a sense of \\r\\n\\t\\townership of the man for whom this school is named. The background that you have here makes this a fitting place to \\r\\n\\t\\tintroduce ourunclassified summaryof the classified document.\\xa0 You \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, parts of it are classified because we owe a degree of \\r\\n\\t\\tconfidentiality to the troops who will carry out this strategy. It is, as was noted by the dean, our nation\\'s first National Defense \\r\\n\\t\\tStrategy in 10 years.\\xa0 I believe it\\'s a moral obligation for leaders to \\r\\n\\t\\tlay out clearly to the subordinates in the Department of Defense what it \\r\\n\\t\\tis we expect of them.\\r\\n\\t\\tIt is designed to protect America\\'s vital national interests. And this \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense strategy was framed, as was noted by the dean, by President \\r\\n\\t\\tTrump\\'s National Security Strategy.\\xa0 And just a couple of words out of \\r\\n\\t\\tthat to show you what I mean that it was framed; that it is inside the \\r\\n\\t\\tframework of that National Security Strategy, specifically, where it states that we\\'re to \"protect the American \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople, the homeland and the American way of life.\" And it goes on to \\r\\n\\t\\tsay \"and to preserve peace through strength.\"\\xa0 Those are words out of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe National Security Strategy and we carry those themes inside the \\r\\n\\t\\tPentagon, where we say, \"What does that mean for us?\" Of course, national security is much more than just defense; this is our \\r\\n\\t\\tpart of the responsibility. Today, America\\'s military reclaims an era of strategic purpose and we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\talert to the realities of a changing world and attentive to the need to \\r\\n\\t\\tprotect our values and the countries that stand with us. America\\'s military protects our way of life and I want to point out it \\r\\n\\t\\talso protects a realm of ideas.\\xa0 It\\'s not just about protecting \\r\\n\\t\\tgeography.\\xa0 This is a defense strategy that will guide our efforts in \\r\\n\\t\\tall realms. The world, to quote George Shultz, is \"awash in change,\" defined by \\r\\n\\t\\tincreasing global volatility and uncertainty with Great Power \\r\\n\\t\\tcompetition between nations becoming a reality once again.\\xa0 Though we \\r\\n\\t\\twill continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists that we are \\r\\n\\t\\tengaged in today, but Great Power competition, not terrorism, is now the \\r\\n\\t\\tprimary focus of U.S. national security. This strategy is fit for our time, providing the American people the \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary required to protect our way of life, stand with our allies, and \\r\\n\\t\\tlive up to our responsibility to pass intact to the next generation \\r\\n\\t\\tthose freedoms that all of us enjoy here today. Adapting to today\\'s realities, this strategy expands our competitive \\r\\n\\t\\tspace, prioritizes preparedness for war, provides clear direction for \\r\\n\\t\\tsignificant change at the speed of relevance, and builds a more lethal \\r\\n\\t\\tforce to compete strategically. This strategy makes a clear-eyed appraisal of our security environment, \\r\\n\\t\\twith a keen eye on America\\'s place in the world.\\xa0 This required some \\r\\n\\t\\ttough choices, ladies and gentlemen, and we made them based upon a \\r\\n\\t\\tfundamental precept, namely that America can afford survival. We face growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China \\r\\n\\t\\tand Russia are from each other, nations that do seek to create a world \\r\\n\\t\\tconsistent with their authoritarian models, pursuing veto authority over \\r\\n\\t\\tother nations\\' economic, diplomatic and security decisions. Rogue regimes like North Korea and Iran persist in taking outlaw actions \\r\\n\\t\\tthat threaten regional and even global stability.\\xa0 Oppressing their own \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople and shredding their own people\\'s dignity and human rights, they \\r\\n\\t\\tpush their warped views outward. And despite the defeat of ISIS\\' physical caliphate, violent extremist \\r\\n\\t\\torganizations like ISIS or Lebanese Hezbollah or al Qaida continue to \\r\\n\\t\\tsow hatred, destroying peace and murdering innocents across the globe. In this time of change, our military is still strong.\\xa0 Yet our \\r\\n\\t\\tcompetitive edge has eroded in every domain of warfare, air, land, sea, \\r\\n\\t\\tspace and cyberspace, and it is continuing to erode. Rapid technological change, the negative impact on military readiness is \\r\\n\\t\\tresulting from the longest continuous stretch of combat in our nation\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\thistory and defense spending caps, because we have been operating also \\r\\n\\t\\tfor nine of the last 10 years under continuing resolutions that have \\r\\n\\t\\tcreated an overstretched and under-resourced military. Our military\\'s role is to keep the peace; to keep the peace for one more \\r\\n\\t\\tyear, one more month, one more week, one more day.\\xa0 To ensure our \\r\\n\\t\\tdiplomats who are working to solve problems do so from a position of \\r\\n\\t\\tstrength and giving allies confidence in us.\\xa0 This confidence is \\r\\n\\t\\tunderpinned by the assurance that our military will win should diplomacy \\r\\n\\t\\tfail. Whenunveiling his national security strategy, President Trump said, \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unquestioned strength is \\r\\n\\t\\tthe most certain means of defense.\"2 Ladies and gentlemen, we have no room for complacency, and history makes \\r\\n\\t\\tclear that America has no preordained right to victory on the \\r\\n\\t\\tbattlefield.\\xa0 Simply, we must be the best if the values that grew out of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Enlightenment are to survive. It is incumbent upon us to field a more lethal force if our nation is to \\r\\n\\t\\tretain the ability to defend ourselves and what we stand for.\\xa0 The \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense strategy\\'s three primary lines of effort will restore our \\r\\n\\t\\tcomparative military advantage. We\\'re going to build a more lethal force.\\xa0 We will strengthen our \\r\\n\\t\\ttraditional alliances and building new partnerships with other nations.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd at the same time we\\'ll reform our department\\'s business practices \\r\\n\\t\\tfor performance and affordability. In doing this, we will earn the trust of the American people and \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress, if their defense dollars are well spent. But let me go through each of the lines of effort.\\xa0 And I want to start \\r\\n\\t\\twith lethality, because everything we do in the department must \\r\\n\\t\\tcontribute to the lethality of our military.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe paradox of war is that an enemy will attack any perceived weakness.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tSo we in America cannot adopt a single preclusive form of warfare.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tRather we must be able to fight across the spectrum of conflict. This means that the size and the composition of our force matters.\\xa0 The \\r\\n\\t\\tnation must field sufficient capable forces to deter conflict.\\xa0 And if \\r\\n\\t\\tdeterrence fails, we must win. We will modernize key capabilities, recognizing we cannot expect success \\r\\n\\t\\tfighting tomorrow\\'s conflicts with yesterday\\'s weapons or equipment.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tInvestments in space and cyberspace, nuclear deterrent forces, missile \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense, advanced autonomous systems, and resilient and agile logistics \\r\\n\\t\\twill provide our high-quality troops what they need to win. Changing our forces\\' posture will prioritize readiness for warfighting \\r\\n\\t\\tfor major combat, making us strategically predictable for our allies and \\r\\n\\t\\toperationally unpredictable for any adversary. Increasing the lethality of our troops, supported by our defense \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilians, requires us to reshape our approach that managing our \\r\\n\\t\\toutstanding talent, reinvigorating our military education and honing \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilian workforce expertise.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe creativity and talent of the department is our deepest wellspring of \\r\\n\\t\\tstrength, and one that warrants greater investment. And to those who would threaten America\\'s experiment in democracy, they \\r\\n\\t\\tmust know:\\xa0 If you challenge us it will be your longest and your worst \\r\\n\\t\\tday.\\xa0 Work with our diplomats; you don\\'t want to fight the Department of \\r\\n\\t\\tDefense. The second line of effort I noted was to strengthen alliances as we \\r\\n\\t\\tbuild new partnerships, as well.\\r\\n\\t\\tIn my past, I fought many times and never did I fight in a solely \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican formation.\\xa0 It was always alongside foreign troops.\\r\\n\\t\\tNow, as Winston Churchill once said, the only thing harder than fighting \\r\\n\\t\\twith allies is fighting without them.1But we are going to be stronger \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether in recognizing that our military will be designed and trained \\r\\n\\t\\tand ready to fight alongside allies. History proves that nations with allies thrive, an approach to security \\r\\n\\t\\tand prosperity that has served the United States well in keeping peace \\r\\n\\t\\tand winning war.\\xa0 Working by, with and through allies who carry their \\r\\n\\t\\tequitable share allows us to amass the greatest possible strength. We carried a disproportionate share of the defense burden for the \\r\\n\\t\\tdemocracies in the post-World War II era.\\xa0 The growing economic strength \\r\\n\\t\\tof today\\'s democracies and partners dictates they must now step up and \\r\\n\\t\\tdo more. When together we pool our resources and share responsibility for the \\r\\n\\t\\tcommon defense, individual nations\\' security burdens become lighter.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tThis has been demonstrated right now, today, for example, by over 70 \\r\\n\\t\\tnations and international organizations of the Defeat-ISIS campaign that \\r\\n\\t\\tis successfully conducting operations in the Middle East.\\xa0 And again, \\r\\n\\t\\tthe 40-odd nations that stand shoulder-to-shoulder in NATO\\'s mission in \\r\\n\\t\\tAfghanistan. To strengthen and work jointly with more allies, our organizations, \\r\\n\\t\\tprocesses and procedures must be ally-friendly.\\xa0 The department will do \\r\\n\\t\\tmore than just listen to other nations\\' ideas.\\xa0 We will be willing to be \\r\\n\\t\\tpersuaded by them, recognizing that all not -- that not all good ideas \\r\\n\\t\\tcome from the country with the most aircraft carriers. This line of effort will bolster an extended network capable of \\r\\n\\t\\tdecisively meeting the challenges of our time.\\xa0 So we\\'re going to make \\r\\n\\t\\tthe military more lethal, and we are going to build and strengthen \\r\\n\\t\\ttraditional alliances, as well as go out and find some new partners -- \\r\\n\\t\\tmaybe nontraditional partners -- as we do what theGreatest Generationdid, coming home from World War II, when they built the alliances that \\r\\n\\t\\thave served us so well, right through today. Our third line of effort serves as the foundation for our competitive \\r\\n\\t\\tedge:\\xa0 reforming the business practices of the department to provide \\r\\n\\t\\tboth solvency and security, thereby gaining the full benefit from every \\r\\n\\t\\tdollar spent, in which way we will gain and hold the trust of Congress \\r\\n\\t\\tand the American people. We are going to have to be good stewards of the \\r\\n\\t\\ttax dollars allocated to us, and that means results and accountability \\r\\n\\t\\tmatter. To keep pace with our times, the department will transition to a culture \\r\\n\\t\\tof performance and affordability that operates at the speed of \\r\\n\\t\\trelevance.\\xa0 Success does not go to the country that develops a new \\r\\n\\t\\ttechnology first, but rather, to the one that better integrates it and \\r\\n\\t\\tmore swiftly adapts its way of fighting. Our current bureaucratic processes are insufficiently responsive to the \\r\\n\\t\\tdepartment\\'s needs for new equipment.\\xa0 We will prioritize speed of \\r\\n\\t\\tdelivery, continuous adaptation and frequent modular upgrades. We must shed outdated management and acquisition practices, while \\r\\n\\t\\tadopting American industry\\'s best practices.\\xa0 Our management structure \\r\\n\\t\\tand process are not engraved in stone.\\xa0 They are a means to an end, \\r\\n\\t\\tempowering our warfighters with the knowledge, equipment and support \\r\\n\\t\\tneeded to fight and win. If the current structures inhibit our pursuit of lethality, I expect the \\r\\n\\t\\tservice secretaries and agency heads to consolidate, eliminate, or \\r\\n\\t\\trestructure to achieve the mission. Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan is leading this third line of \\r\\n\\t\\teffort:\\xa0 to leverage the scale of our operations, driving better \\r\\n\\t\\tdeals for equipping our troops. This national defense strategy will guide all our actions, aligning the \\r\\n\\t\\tdepartment\\'s three lines of effort to gain synergies.\\xa0 But we \\r\\n\\t\\trecognize no strategy can long survive without necessary funding and the \\r\\n\\t\\tstable, predictable budgets required to defend America in the modern \\r\\n\\t\\tage. Failure to modernize our military risks leaving us with a force that \\r\\n\\t\\tcould dominate the last war, but be irrelevant to tomorrow\\'s security.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tLet me be clear:\\xa0 As hard as the last 16 years have been on our \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of \\r\\n\\t\\tthe U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tdefense spending cuts, worsened by us operating, 9 of the last 10 years, \\r\\n\\t\\tunder continuing resolutions, wasting copious amounts of precious \\r\\n\\t\\ttaxpayer dollars. Today, as our competitive edge over our foes erodes due to budgetary \\r\\n\\t\\tconfusion, even with storm clouds gathering, America\\'s military, as I \\r\\n\\t\\tspeak, is operating under yet another continuing resolution. For too long, we have asked our military to stoically carry a \"success \\r\\n\\t\\tat any cost\" attitude as they work tirelessly to accomplish the mission \\r\\n\\t\\twith now inadequate and misaligned resources, simply because the \\r\\n\\t\\tCongress could not maintain regular order. That we have performed well is a credit to our wonderful and loyal \\r\\n\\t\\ttroops, but loyalty must be a two-way street.\\xa0 We expect the magnificent \\r\\n\\t\\tmen and women of our military to be faithful in their service, even when \\r\\n\\t\\tgoing in harm\\'s way.\\xa0 We must remain faithful to those who voluntarily \\r\\n\\t\\tsign a blank check, payable to the American people with their lives. As Speaker Ryansaid yesterday(quote), \"Our men and women in uniform are \\r\\n\\t\\tnot bargaining chips.\"3 The consequences of not providing a budget are clear:\\xa0 Without a \\r\\n\\t\\tsustained budget, ships will not receive the required maintenance to put \\r\\n\\t\\tto sea; the ships already at sea will be extended outside of port; \\r\\n\\t\\taircraft will remain on the ground, their pilots not at the sharpest \\r\\n\\t\\tedge; and eventually, eventually ammunition, training and manpower will \\r\\n\\t\\tnot be sufficient to deter war.But I am optimistic that Congress will do the right thing and carry out \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir responsibility.\\xa0 I may be in the minority in this room, when I say \\r\\n\\t\\tthat -- but I\\'m an eternal optimist. And as Senator Reid said last November, \"We need bipartisan investment \\r\\n\\t\\tin our troops to enhance military readiness and help us meet evolving \\r\\n\\t\\tnational security challenges.\"4 Under our Constitution, it is Congress that has the authority to raise \\r\\n\\t\\tarmies and to maintain navies.\\xa0 Yet as I stand here this morning, \\r\\n\\t\\twatching the news, as we all are, from Capitol Hill, we\\'re on the verge \\r\\n\\t\\tof a government shutdown or, at best, yet another debilitating \\r\\n\\t\\tcontinuing resolution. We need Congress back in the driver\\'s seat of budget decisions, not in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe spectator seat of Budget Control Acts\\' indiscriminate and automatic \\r\\n\\t\\tcuts.\\xa0 We need a budget and we need budget predictability if we\\'re to \\r\\n\\t\\tsustain our military\\'s primacy. Now, many of us in this room were born free, here in America, completely \\r\\n\\t\\tby accident.\\xa0 All of us can live here by choice, thanks to the veterans \\r\\n\\t\\tand the patriots who serve today in our military.\\xa0 Yet we today have an \\r\\n\\t\\tobligation to pass intact to the next generation the same freedoms we \\r\\n\\t\\tenjoy right now.\\r\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s an obligation that we have.\\xa0 That\\'s not something we can simply \\r\\n\\t\\tabrogate to someone else.\\r\\n\\t\\tAnd I believe that this strategy, resourced appropriately, will ensure \\r\\n\\t\\twe live up to our responsibility to our children\\'s generation.So with that, ladies and gentlemen, and the dean did say he was going to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp me answer the questions.\\xa0 So thanks very much for that -- what \\r\\n\\t\\tI recognize is a slip of the tongue, but in this town that can get you \\r\\n\\t\\tinto a lot of trouble, and I speak with authority on that. So -- but ladies and gentlemen, let\\'s see where we\\'re at.\\xa0 Let\\'s have a \\r\\n\\t\\tdialogue now.\\r\\n\\t\\tAgain, this is -- we serve you.\\xa0 This is your strategy as much as it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tours.\\xa0 We had a responsibility to write it, and it\\'s up to us to be able \\r\\n\\t\\tto defend it intellectually, alongside you and in the face of any \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions you have.\\xa0 So let\\'s hear what\\'s on your mind. Now, where\\'s Katherine at?\\xa0 She\\'s somewhere around here.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});   Moderator \\r\\n\\t\\tStandbridge:Thank you for your remarks, Secretary Mattis.\\xa0 My name is \\r\\n\\t\\tKatherine Standbridge.\\xa0 I\\'m a second-year M.A. student here at SAIS, and \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll be reading the questions that have been submitted by the audience. So our first question:\\xa0 \"Building capability and capacity are \\r\\n\\t\\tchallenging to achieve at the same time.\\xa0 Do you see one of these as \\r\\n\\t\\tbeing more important in the near term?\"SecDef Mattis:Yes.\\xa0 Very good question.So capabilities are what does the force bring?\\xa0 And you look at every \\r\\n\\t\\tcapability in a force, you look at changing times, what are the \\r\\n\\t\\tthreats.\\xa0 We try to define the threats to what I would call a Jesuit\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tlevel of satisfaction, which is tough indeed.\\xa0 And at that point, we \\r\\n\\t\\tthen determine, do we need additional capabilities?Then you have capacity.\\xa0 In other words, how big is the force that you \\r\\n\\t\\thave.I believe, at this time, in this age, that emphasizing the capabilities \\r\\n\\t\\tthat the force brings is probably the predominant effort that you\\'ve got \\r\\n\\t\\tto make.At the same time, capacity, the size of your force, makes a difference.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tThere are nations that have stood by us for years and to whom we look \\r\\n\\t\\tmany times for support.\\xa0 And some of those forces have been shrunk to a \\r\\n\\t\\tpoint that they no longer allow their diplomats to speak with strength.So we have to make certain we keep a force of sufficient size.\\xa0 But my \\r\\n\\t\\temphasis right now is on building the capacity.\\xa0 Do we have the cyber \\r\\n\\t\\ttroops in there?\\xa0 Do we have the intelligence analysts in there that \\r\\n\\t\\tallow us to be at the top of the game when we make that grave choice to \\r\\n\\t\\tsend our young folks into the -- into a fight?Moderator Standbridge:Thank you.\\xa0\\xa0Next question:\\xa0 How does the NDS intend to modernize U.S. forces and \\r\\n\\t\\tprepare the U.S. for a conflict with some of the world\\'s rising powers?SecDef Mattis:Well, what -- first of all, you\\'ve got to accept the \\r\\n\\t\\treality.\\xa0 You have to look -- with reality of what the world looks like, \\r\\n\\t\\tand what are those challenges to our way of life.There is nothing in here that presupposes war.\\xa0 The whole point -- and \\r\\n\\t\\tyou saw it well demonstrated with the NATO alliance.\\xa0 For how many years \\r\\n\\t\\tdid NATO stand strong, all the democracies together from Europe and \\r\\n\\t\\tNorth America?\\xa0 How long did we stand together?\\xa0 And what was a Cold War \\r\\n\\t\\tnever became a hot war on the plains of Europe.So the point is, how do we create a military that is that compelling?\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd what you have to do is you have to take the threats as they stand.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tYou have to make certain you\\'re integrated with the State Department\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tforeign policies, so we\\'re operating with very much a depth to our State \\r\\n\\t\\tDepartment -- not outside the State Department\\'s foreign policy, but \\r\\n\\t\\tinside it.And so it starts with me having breakfast every week with Secretary of \\r\\n\\t\\tState Tillerson.\\xa0 And we talk two, three times a day, sometimes.\\xa0 We \\r\\n\\t\\tsettle all of our issues between he and I, and then we walk together \\r\\n\\t\\tinto the White House meetings.\\xa0 That way, State and Defense are \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether.And this allows us, as we look at a military that must adapt to its \\r\\n\\t\\ttimes, we also are in step with the foreign policy.\\xa0 You do not want to \\r\\n\\t\\tget detached from that and think that you\\'re just going to automatically \\r\\n\\t\\tserve the needs of our country.Then, when you get down to the discrete elements of military power, it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\ta much more straightforward process, to tell you the truth.\\xa0 You look at \\r\\n\\t\\twhat capabilities other countries have.\\xa0 You look at what technology is \\r\\n\\t\\tbringing on board.\\xa0 You put it together.\\xa0 You prioritize, based on the \\r\\n\\t\\tthreat analysis that is done both inside the Pentagon, but that is never \\r\\n\\t\\tenough; I want an outside view as well, and that\\'s why we have a very \\r\\n\\t\\tclose link with the CIA and foreign intelligence services.And then we also have officers assigned to other nations\\' armed forces, \\r\\n\\t\\tor on duty in our embassies around the world, and they are also feeding \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom our friends -- they\\'re feeding more ideas in, and certainly, \\r\\n\\t\\tthey\\'re keeping us updated on what they\\'re seeing of potential adversary \\r\\n\\t\\tsystems.So you put it together in that manner, and then it becomes like a \\r\\n\\t\\tRubik\\'s Cube.\\xa0 As you move defensive and offensive capabilities \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether, you work with allies -- I\\'m on my way to Brussels here, in a \\r\\n\\t\\tcouple weeks, to work with our allies again, as we look at what we call \\r\\n\\t\\tNATO capability gaps.\\xa0 They\\'re not all going to be filled by us.\\xa0 Some \\r\\n\\t\\tof them are going to be filled by others, and that\\'s the way it should \\r\\n\\t\\tbe when democracies band together to defend the principles we stand on.So it\\'s an analysis, and then it\\'s an assignment of priority, and then \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s an allocation of resources.\\xa0 If you don\\'t get the resources -- my \\r\\n\\t\\tclosing words -- then your strategy is nothing more than a \\r\\n\\t\\thallucination, because, without the resources, there\\'s just so much \\r\\n\\t\\tbrave young men and women can do.Moderator Standbridge:Thank you.\\xa0\\xa0Continuing in a similar vein, how well linked is the NDS to the budgets \\r\\n\\t\\tand activities of the State Department and civilian agencies?SecDef Mattis:Yes, it is somewhat linked.\\xa0 Again, I do not take any -- \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'m leaving to visit Indonesia and Vietnam this weekend, and before I \\r\\n\\t\\tgo, I sit down with Secretary Tillerson, and he actually sends to me in \\r\\n\\t\\twriting, at some point after we\\'ve talked, what are the foreign policy \\r\\n\\t\\tparameters, what are the priorities he has while I\\'m visiting those \\r\\n\\t\\tcountries.I think that probably the most important thing is to ensure that, in \\r\\n\\t\\teverything we say and in everything we do, we are reinforcing our \\r\\n\\t\\tdiplomats.\\xa0 That\\'s the way it works when you\\'re doing foreign policy, \\r\\n\\t\\tand we\\'re an instrument of foreign policy.As some of our tough young men put it, we do the last 600 meters of \\r\\n\\t\\tforeign policy.\\xa0 And that\\'s a fair statement in terms of -- we\\'re there, \\r\\n\\t\\tfirst of all, to back up the diplomats.\\xa0 And then, you know, if push \\r\\n\\t\\tcomes to shove and we\\'re unable to avert -- you know, basically avert \\r\\n\\t\\twar, or we end up in one, then we carry it forward.But our job, even then, is to develop something better for peace.\\xa0 It\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tnot just to fight a war.\\xa0 It\\'s for a political reason.\\xa0 That\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\testablished by State.We do work together.\\xa0 I have some development money that\\'s allotted to \\r\\n\\t\\tme by the U.S. Congress because of where we operate around the world.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tWhen we spend that money, already at the highest levels of State and \\r\\n\\t\\tDefense Department, we have sat down and prioritized that money \\r\\n\\t\\ttogether.\\xa0 We don\\'t go off and spend that money without State Department \\r\\n\\t\\thelping with the pen to say \\x93what are the priorities that we have?\\x94Moderator Standbridge:Thank you.\\xa0\\xa0And, again continuing on this track, how is the DOD working to encourage \\r\\n\\t\\tallies and partners to build up their own defense capabilities?SecDef Mattis:It\\'s -- that\\'s actually going better than I expected.\\xa0 I \\r\\n\\t\\tcame here -- I remember flying out of Denver -- I kind of was flying in \\r\\n\\t\\there to go in to confirmation.\\xa0 And I was trying to think of how do I \\r\\n\\t\\tput \"America first\" into, in my mind, an alliance framework.And, as we were getting on -- ready to take off, you know what \\r\\n\\t\\thappened.\\xa0 You all can recite it from memory.\\xa0 The stewardess was \\r\\n\\t\\tstanding there, and she said, \"In the event we lose cabin pressure\" -- \\r\\n\\t\\tyou know what\\'s coming next, every one of you, don\\'t you?\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\t\"When the masks drop, put your own mask on first, then help others.\"So what we\\'re going to do is restore America\\'s economic viability, \\r\\n\\t\\tbecause no nation in history has maintained its military power that was \\r\\n\\t\\tnot economically viable and did not keep its fiscal house in order.So the first thing was, when I went into Brussels on my first meeting \\r\\n\\t\\tthere with the most critical alliance we have, which is the 29 nations \\r\\n\\t\\tof NATO, I said -- I used that example, and I said, \"But I\\'ve got to \\r\\n\\t\\ttell you\" -- I said, \"that I\\'m speaking from the heart.\"I knew many of them.\\xa0 I\\'d been a Supreme Allied Commander in NATO in a \\r\\n\\t\\tprevious job, and I said, \"I know many of you here.\"\\xa0 I said, \"I have \\r\\n\\t\\tsat behind Secretary Rumsfeld, when he came here and said you\\'re going \\r\\n\\t\\tto have to pay more, you can\\'t expect the Americans to keep doing this.\"I said, \"I\\'ve heard Secretary Gates put his prepared remarks down and \\r\\n\\t\\ttell you he needs to lay this on the line, that the American people do \\r\\n\\t\\tnot want to continue to carry a disproportionate share.\"And I said, \"You have heard it from President Obama\\'s administration.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve been here and I\\'ve heard it said then.\\xa0 And now it\\'s manifested \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitically in America, so here\\'s the bottom line.\"Please do not ask me to go back and tell Americans that they -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican parents that they need to care more about the safety and \\r\\n\\t\\tsecurity and the freedom of your children than you\\'re willing to care \\r\\n\\t\\tfor, that you\\'re willing to sacrifice for.\"We\\'re all going to have to put our shoulder to the wagon, and move it \\r\\n\\t\\tup the hill.\"Surprisingly, I did not lose the rapport that I really -- I would lose \\r\\n\\t\\trapport with some of them.\\xa0 I mean, that\\'s a -- that\\'s a hard message.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tBut I wanted to put it in human terms, because this is a human situation \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'re talking about.I don\\'t think that the values that grew out of the Enlightenment are \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething that simply exist in isolation and don\\'t need to be defended.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd there\\'s enough other things going on in the world.\\xa0 We can see this.So the argument is made for itself.\\xa0 The argument is made for itself.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tThe CIA briefed me, when I came in, that my first crisis would probably \\r\\n\\t\\tbe somewhere in the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0 My first trip overseas -- went to \\r\\n\\t\\tTokyo and Seoul, and I will tell you, there are two nations that are \\r\\n\\t\\tdoing a lot for their own defense, and we\\'re very tightly bonded.\\xa0 It\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\ta trusted relationship.So it\\'s actually going well.\\xa0 The message has been received in positive \\r\\n\\t\\tterms.\\xa0 I do not have antagonistic or adversary terms with any of our \\r\\n\\t\\ttraditional allies.\\xa0 And we have new allies who are eager to start \\r\\n\\t\\tworking military-to-military with us at this time.So, so far, it\\'s going okay.\\xa0 But, of course, these are all democracies, \\r\\n\\t\\tby and large, we\\'re dealing with, and they have their own constituencies \\r\\n\\t\\tinside each country.\\xa0 That\\'s a political reality -- all politics are \\r\\n\\t\\tlocal, whether you\\'re in the United States, or you\\'re in, you know, \\r\\n\\t\\tPoland or anywhere else.But, so far, I\\'m very encouraged by what I\\'ve seen, and we could not be \\r\\n\\t\\tbetter served than by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, there in \\r\\n\\t\\tBrussels, with our primary alliance.\\xa0 And the way he leads that alliance \\r\\n\\t\\tis one where we all have to work together and do our fair share.Moderator Standbridge:Thank you.\\xa0\\xa0Next question:\\xa0 How can the military institutionalize and preserve \\r\\n\\t\\tcounterinsurgency lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, as we shift to a \\r\\n\\t\\tgreater focus on near-peer rivals, like China and Russia? SecDef Mattis:Yes.\\xa0 If I was to sum up the challenge that we have inside \\r\\n\\t\\tthe department in carrying out this strategy, it\\'s threefold.It\\'s how do we maintain a safe and effective nuclear deterrent, so those \\r\\n\\t\\tweapons are never used?\\xa0 It\\'s a nuclear deterrent.\\xa0 It\\'s not a \\r\\n\\t\\twarfighting capability, unless it\\'s the worst day in our nation or the \\r\\n\\t\\tworld\\'s history.\\xa0 So that\\'s the first one -- priority -- a safe and \\r\\n\\t\\teffective nuclear deterrent.Number two is how do you field, in the modern age, a decisive \\r\\n\\t\\tconventional force?\\xa0 It\\'s expensive.\\xa0 We recognize that.\\xa0 But it\\'s less \\r\\n\\t\\texpensive than fighting a war with somebody who thought that we were \\r\\n\\t\\tweak enough that they could take advantage.And the third is, at the same time as we field that conventional force, \\r\\n\\t\\thow do you sustain a counterinsurgency capability inside your force?\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tAnd why do I say that?\\xa0 I go back to the words of the most \\r\\n\\t\\tnear-faultless strategist alive today, Dr. Colin Gray of Reading \\r\\n\\t\\tUniversity, who said, \"The paradox of war being\" -- and I said it in my \\r\\n\\t\\t-- in my prepared remarks -- \"that the enemy will always move against \\r\\n\\t\\tyour perceived weakness, we cannot marry adopt one preclusive form of \\r\\n\\t\\twarfare\" -- say we\\'re not going to do counterinsurgency, because you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow what\\'s going to happen.And so we are going to have to do it -- I see it as a -- it is, \\r\\n\\t\\trelatively, a training and education issue.\\xa0 It doesn\\'t take a lot of \\r\\n\\t\\tspecialized kit -- there\\'s some -- but it takes language skills.\\xa0 It \\r\\n\\t\\ttakes young men and women who want to join up and serve their country \\r\\n\\t\\twho have studied other nations, who speak the language.\\xa0 It takes not \\r\\n\\t\\tjust cultural appreciation, but it takes the kind of training that puts \\r\\n\\t\\tan awful lot of authority in the hands of 20-year-old corporals and \\r\\n\\t\\t24-year-old, 23-year-old second lieutenants.Now, those forces, in that labor-intensive kind of warfare, scatter \\r\\n\\t\\tamong innocent people.\\xa0 And we fight those wars so obviously among the \\r\\n\\t\\tinnocent that it takes a very well-trained, well-honed force.But it\\'s mostly training and it\\'s mostly education that allows us to \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep counterinsurgency inside the great power competition force that we \\r\\n\\t\\tare composing.Moderator Standbridge:Thank you.\\xa0\\r\\n\\t\\tWith cybersecurity a rising concern in both public and private sectors, \\r\\n\\t\\thow does the NDS plan to address strengthening U.S. cybersecurity \\r\\n\\t\\tmeasures?SecDef Mattis:Right.\\xa0 If you look back, put it in historical terms, \\r\\n\\t\\tladies and gentlemen, we began fighting on the ground, I don\\'t know, \\r\\n\\t\\t5,000 years ago -- about the first time somebody envied something \\r\\n\\t\\tsomebody else had, I guess.We went to sea and went maritime probably about, I don\\'t know, 4,000 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears ago.\\xa0 Then, about 100 years ago -- a little over a hundred years \\r\\n\\t\\tago, World War I, we went into the air domain.And then -- so we had a couple thousand years for a couple of them.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tWe\\'ve had a hundred years to incorporate air.\\xa0 And now, in a matter of a \\r\\n\\t\\tlittle more than a decade, really, we\\'ve added cyberspace and outer \\r\\n\\t\\tspace as potential warfighting -- as warfighting domains.\\xa0 It\\'s the way \\r\\n\\t\\twe must look at it, since we\\'re your sentinels, we\\'re your sentries who \\r\\n\\t\\tguard America.\\xa0 We have to look at it that way.In cyber, what we are going to do is reorganize.\\xa0 I told you we\\'re \\r\\n\\t\\treorganizing the department to a degree.\\xa0 You\\'re going to see \\r\\n\\t\\treorganization of the fundamental organizations.\\xa0 The U.S. Cyber Command \\r\\n\\t\\tand the National Security Agency -- they will be organized along \\r\\n\\t\\tdifferent lines.We are going to have to, then, resource them in education, with training \\r\\n\\t\\tprograms, recruiting programs and mission statements so that the \\r\\n\\t\\treorganized forces are working together, because this is a Wild West \\r\\n\\t\\tright now.\\xa0 As you know, people in their bedrooms can be doing things \\r\\n\\t\\tthat are causing your bank account dire problems, at this point.So I would just tell you, it\\'s going to have to look at this problem \\r\\n\\t\\tmuch more broadly than the department has looked at problems in the \\r\\n\\t\\tpast.\\xa0 And that means we have to be relevant to the security of everyone \\r\\n\\t\\twho\\'s looking at me right now, not just relevant to our forces in the \\r\\n\\t\\tbattlefield in some overseas land.What that means:\\xa0 I\\'ve got to get some really bright people in.\\xa0 And \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'ve got them on our Defense Innovation Board.\\xa0 They come out of places \\r\\n\\t\\tlike Silicon Valley, and they are the top of the line.\\xa0 And they are an \\r\\n\\t\\tenormous help as we craft the specifics to this.But most of all it\\'s that we have got to absorb now, this is a mission, \\r\\n\\t\\tand we can\\'t say, \"We\\'d just like to have our airplanes and our tanks \\r\\n\\t\\tand our ships.\\xa0 We don\\'t want to get into that messy thing.\"Now, where this takes us, there\\'s a lot of things we have to look at.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tOur founding fathers, on cyber, were very, very -- they \\r\\n\\t\\tobviously anticipated things.\\xa0 And what is it?\\xa0 Remember?\\xa0 Life and \\r\\n\\t\\tliberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\xa0 Think.\\xa0 They knew that, in \\r\\n\\t\\tprotecting life, we also had to be protecting liberty.And how do we protect life, if cyber could shut down all the power in a \\r\\n\\t\\tpart of our country that would kill people in hospitals or paralyze \\r\\n\\t\\teconomies that are required to keep people alive, and that sort of \\r\\n\\t\\tthing?How do we deal with that, when that\\'s not what you and I would call a \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary mission?\\xa0 Matter of fact, we have laws that prohibit us -- and \\r\\n\\t\\twe are proud of those laws -- from doing certain things in this \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry.\\xa0 You don\\'t see any military person arresting anybody in this \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry -- not our -- not our authority under the Constitution.So what are we going to do in an area that was not addressed other than \\r\\n\\t\\tthematically, that we must keep our constitutional rights alive even as \\r\\n\\t\\twe protect our people?\\xa0 And that\\'s going to be something that I will not \\r\\n\\t\\tdecide.\\xa0 You will all be helping us decide that, because we will need \\r\\n\\t\\tyou involved in this.I mean, what do we do?\\xa0 Do we decide we\\'ll put up a domain, and if \\r\\n\\t\\tsomebody wants to, they can go inside it and we\\'ll have a military force \\r\\n\\t\\ttrying to protect that domain?\\xa0 And if you put your account and your \\r\\n\\t\\tbank account in there, you get protection?\\xa0 And someone who thinks that \\r\\n\\t\\twe\\'re up to no good, says, \"I\\'m not getting in that\" -- that\\'s okay -- \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom of choice, right?So where are we going to go with this?\\xa0 I need to get some more people \\r\\n\\t\\tin to structure this thematically, so we lay out choices for you and see \\r\\n\\t\\twhat our Congress decides is the right level of military involvement or \\r\\n\\t\\twhat we have to offer there.It\\'s a very complex issue.\\xa0 For right now, I\\'m focused mostly on just \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking certain that our military can fight, and supporting FBI and \\r\\n\\t\\tothers when we spot a problem coming in from overseas.\\xa0 We will pick it \\r\\n\\t\\tup, and we notify the law enforcement agencies now.But there\\'s a lot more to be done, ladies and gentlemen, and I have not \\r\\n\\t\\tgot that defined yet.\\xa0 Inside the military, we\\'re good to go to; we know \\r\\n\\t\\twhat we have to do.\\xa0 More broadly, I\\'m not sure yet. Moderator \\r\\n\\t\\tStandbridge:Thank you, Secretary Mattis. One last question:\\xa0 Will a government shutdown have serious \\r\\n\\t\\tramifications on military operations?\\xa0 And, if so, what are your plans \\r\\n\\t\\tfor mitigation? SecDef Mattis:Yes.\\r\\n\\t\\tLet me give you an example.\\xa0 This morning or last night, young guys and \\r\\n\\t\\tgals somewhere in Wyoming were driving off to do their weekend duty.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tThere\\'s any number of projects we have underway that keep me at the top \\r\\n\\t\\tof my game, and our military at the top of our game, that are handled by \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilians.\\xa0 All these things are going to be disrupted. Those troops who arrive there at their armories, by the way, and told, \\r\\n\\t\\t\"Go home,\" if there\\'s a government shutdown, and they will then drive a \\r\\n\\t\\tcouple hundred miles back home -- these are -- these, again, are stoic \\r\\n\\t\\tyoung men and women.  They\\'ll suck it up, and they\\'ll say, \"Okay.\"\\xa0 If they\\'re Navy \\r\\n\\t\\treservists, they\\'ll say, \"Aye, aye, sir,\" cheerfully.\\xa0 And, when \\r\\n\\t\\tthey get in their car they may not mutter something quite so positive. I would just tell you, there will be -- our maintenance activities will \\r\\n\\t\\tprobably pretty much shut down.\\xa0 We will not be able to induct any more \\r\\n\\t\\tof our gear, our -- that need maintenance. Over 50 percent altogether of my civilian workforce will be furloughed, \\r\\n\\t\\tand that\\'s going to impact our contracting.\\xa0 It will impact, obviously, \\r\\n\\t\\tour medical facilities.\\xa0 It\\'s got a huge morale impact, I\\'ll just tell \\r\\n\\t\\tyou. How long can you keep good people around when something like this \\r\\n\\t\\thappens, is always a question that\\'s got to hover in the back of my \\r\\n\\t\\tmind. I would just tell you that we do a lot of intelligence operations around \\r\\n\\t\\tthe world, and they cost money.\\xa0 Those, obviously, would stop.\\xa0 And I \\r\\n\\t\\twould just tell you that training for almost our entire reserve force \\r\\n\\t\\twill stop. And you must understand the critical importance of our reserves.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tThey\\'re the only shock absorber we have.\\xa0 It\\'s not like the old days, \\r\\n\\t\\twhere you could draft somebody in and, 18 weeks later, have them in \\r\\n\\t\\tcombat with the skills they need. Today\\'s infantrymen -- they\\'re called infantrymen because they\\'re infant \\r\\n\\t\\tsoldiers, young soldiers -- they still take a year to train in order to \\r\\n\\t\\thave them ready to use the gear they have on them and make certain they \\r\\n\\t\\thave the ethical and tactical abilities to deal with the battlefield \\r\\n\\t\\ttoday. So it\\'s got a terrible impact.\\xa0 At the same time, the submarine that was \\r\\n\\t\\tput to sea last week will still be out for three months and, God bless \\r\\n\\t\\tthem, the lads will not have any e-mail connectivity, so they will not \\r\\n\\t\\teven know what\\'s going on as they cruise quietly out there, carrying out \\r\\n\\t\\ttheir duties.\\xa0 The ships at sea will continue.\\xa0 The ones -- our lads in \\r\\n\\t\\tIraq and Afghanistan, who are in the fight, will continue.\\xa0 The young \\r\\n\\t\\tladies who are guiding the drones right now will stay at their desks and \\r\\n\\t\\tkeep them overhead. So we will continue what we\\'re doing.\\xa0 But the value of the American \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary is grossly enhanced by the sense that the American model of \\r\\n\\t\\tgovernment -- of the people, by the people, for the people -- can \\r\\n\\t\\tfunction and carry out its governmental responsibilities. We\\'re not -- I didn\\'t serve in the Marine Corps for 40-odd years.\\xa0 I \\r\\n\\t\\tserved in the U.S. Marine Corps -- belong to you, accountable to you, as \\r\\n\\t\\tSpeaker Ryan pointed out here.\\xa0 For those out there right now, in the \\r\\n\\t\\tfield, at sea, in the air, the ones sitting in the ready room over here \\r\\n\\t\\tat Andrews Air Force Base, I\\'d just tell you that they deserve -- they \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserve full support.\\xa0 And we have got to come to grips with this as a \\r\\n\\t\\tnation. Why don\\'t we take one more?\\xa0 Katherine, you choose. Moderator \\r\\n\\t\\tStandbridge:Absolutely.\\xa0 This final question:\\xa0 How would the U.S. deter \\r\\n\\t\\tadversaries in space, as space itself becomes [off mic]? SecDef Mattis:Yes, how do we deter in space?\\xa0 It\\'s philosophically -- or \\r\\n\\t\\tbasically in the same way that we would deter anyone else.\\xa0 Don\\'t try \\r\\n\\t\\tit, because we can do more damage to you than any benefit you could \\r\\n\\t\\tgain. So it comes down to that.\\xa0 But what that means is we\\'ve got to have \\r\\n\\t\\tcapabilities to deny them what they want to achieve.\\xa0 In this regard, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s not just about what you might think -- of guns in space shooting \\r\\n\\t\\teach other. It could be nothing more than, \"We have -- for every satellite up, we \\r\\n\\t\\thave 100 more this big that we could launch, so it\\'s just faster \\r\\n\\t\\t[inaudible] out.\\xa0 By the way, we\\'re going to take you down in the United \\r\\n\\t\\tNations and we\\'re going to get economic sanctions.\" In other words, there\\'s a way to raise -- this is what I mentioned, \\r\\n\\t\\texpanding the competitive space.\\xa0 There\\'s no nation that has a wider \\r\\n\\t\\tcompetitive space, in terms of its moral or ethical or economic or \\r\\n\\t\\tmilitary power, than we can amass, if we choose to use it wisely. And so in space, we will do our best to deter.\\xa0 We\\'ll come up, I\\'m sure, \\r\\n\\t\\twith arms control agreements at some point, and we\\'ll start getting this \\r\\n\\t\\tunder control.\\xa0 But, for right now, it\\'s sizing up the problem and \\r\\n\\t\\tmaking certain, again, that our diplomats will be negotiating from a \\r\\n\\t\\tposition of strength, when they negotiate on that. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say thank you for taking time, again, \\r\\n\\t\\tto hear me out this morning.\\xa0 I hope it was of some value, and that the \\r\\n\\t\\tquestions, especially -- I thought were -- by the way, Katherine, thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou for selecting however you did. I know you had more than that, but \\r\\n\\t\\tthe questions, I thought, were very good. And I would just encourage all of you, if you think we\\'re missing \\r\\n\\t\\tsomething or on the wrong track, by all means, notify us. There\\'s ways to get a hold of us, through our public affairs, and I get \\r\\n\\t\\tthose.\\xa0 It\\'s not all love mail, when I get it, I assure you.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\tI didn\\'t realize my parentage involved that, at times. But I would just tell you this is a raucous democracy and our troops \\r\\n\\t\\tstand ready right now, as we\\'re all sitting here enjoying freedoms we \\r\\n\\t\\tsomewhat -- even I -- take for granted. They\\'re out there, right now, ready to do whatever it takes to keep us \\r\\n\\t\\t-- keep us safe.\\xa0 So please keep them in your thoughts and prayers, and \\r\\n\\t\\tknow that they represent the very best of us.\\xa0 They\\'re wonderful, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthey really did sign that check, payable with their lives -- a blank \\r\\n\\t\\tcheck -- to every one of you. So thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I look forward to hearing \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom you.',\n",
       " 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank \\r\\n\\t\\tyou, so much. Thank you, all. Thank you very, very much. Well -- Well, this isn\\'t exactly the party I\\'d planned, but I sure like the \\r\\n\\t\\tcompany. And I want to start today by saying how grateful I am to all of you, to everyone who poured your hearts and your hopes into this campaign, who drove for miles and lined the streets waving homemade signs, who scrimped and saved to raise money, who knocked on doors and made calls, who talked, sometimes argued with your friends and neighbors, who e-mailed and contributed online, who invested so much in our common enterprise, to the moms and dads who came to our events, who lifted their little girls and little boys on their shoulders and whispered in their ears, \"See, you can be anything you want to be.\" To the young people like 13-year-old Anne Riddell [ph] from Mayfield, Ohio, who had been saving for two years to go to Disney World and decided to use her savings instead to travel to Pennsylvania with her mom and volunteer there, as well. To the veterans, to the childhood friends, to New Yorkers and Arkansans who traveled across the country, telling anyone who would listen why you supported me. And to all of those women in their 80s and their 90s born before women could vote, who cast their votes for our campaign. I\\'ve told you before about Florence Stein [ph] of South Dakota who was 88 years old and insisted that her daughter bring an absentee ballot to her hospice bedside. Her daughter and a friend put an American flag behind her bed and helped her fill out the ballot. She passed away soon after and, under state law, her ballot didn\\'t count, but her daughter later told a reporter, \"My dad\\'s an ornery, old cowboy, and he didn\\'t like it when he heard Mom\\'s vote wouldn\\'t be counted. I don\\'t think he had voted in 20 years, but he voted in place of my mom.\" So to all those who voted for me and to whom I pledged my utmost, my commitment to you and to the progress we seek is unyielding. You have inspired and touched me with the stories of the joys and sorrows that make up the fabric of our lives. And you have humbled me with your commitment to our country. Eighteen million of you, from all walks of life -- women and men, young and old, Latino and Asian, African- American and Caucasian, rich, poor, and middle-class, gay and straight, you have stood with me. And I will continue to stand strong with you every time, every place, in every way that I can. The dreams we share are worth fighting for. Remember, we fought for the single mom with the young daughter, juggling work and school, who told me, \"I\\'m doing it all to better myself for her.\" We fought for the woman who grabbed my hand and asked me, \"What are you going to do to make sure I have health care?\" and began to cry, because even though she works three jobs, she can\\'t afford insurance. We fought for the young man in the Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said, \"Take care of my buddies over there, and then will you please take care of me?\" We fought for all those who\\'ve lost jobs and health care, who can\\'t afford gas or groceries or college, who have felt invisible to their President these last seven years. I entered this race because I have an old-fashioned conviction that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their dreams. I\\'ve had every opportunity and blessing in my own life, and I want the same for all Americans. And until that day comes, you\\'ll always find me on the front lines of democracy, fighting for the future. The way to continue our fight now, to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy, our passion, our strength, and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama, the next President of the United States. Today, as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run. I endorse him and throw my full support behind him. And I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me. I have served in the Senate with him for four years. I have been in this campaign with him for 16 months. I have stood on the stage and gone toe-to-toe with him in 22 debates. I\\'ve had a front-row seat to his candidacy, and I have seen his strength and determination, his grace and his grit. In his own life, Barack Obama has lived the American dream, as a community organizer, in the State Senate, as a United States senator. He has dedicated himself to ensuring the dream is realized. And in this campaign, he has inspired so many to become involved in the democratic process and invested in our common future. Now, when I started this race, I intended to win back the White House and make sure we have a President who puts our country back on the path to peace, prosperity and progress. And that\\'s exactly what we\\'re going to do, by ensuring that Barack Obama walks through the doors of the Oval Office on January 20, 2009. Now, I understand -- I understand that we all know this has been a tough fight, but the Democratic Party is a family. And now it\\'s time to restore the ties that bind us together and to come together around the ideals we share, the values we cherish, and the country we love. We may have started on separate journeys, but today our paths have merged. And we\\'re all heading toward the same destination, united and more ready than ever to win in November and to turn our country around, because so much is at stake. We all want an economy that sustains the American dream, the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford that gas and those groceries, and still have a little left over at the end of the month, an economy that lifts all of our people and ensures that our prosperity is broadly distributed and shared. We all want a health care system that is universal, high-quality and affordable, so that parents don\\'t have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead-end jobs simply to keep their insurance. This isn\\'t just an issue for me. It is a passion and a cause, and it is a fight I will continue until every single American is insured, no exceptions and no excuses. We all want an America defined by deep and meaningful equality, from civil rights to labor rights, from women\\'s rights to gay rights from ending discrimination to promoting unionization, to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. And we all want to restore America\\'s standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, and once again lead by the power of our values and to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming. You know, I\\'ve been involved in politics and public life in one way or another for four decades. And during those -- during those 40 years, our country has voted 10 times for President. Democrats won only three of those times, and the man who won two of those elections is with us today. We made tremendous progress during the \\'90s under a Democratic President, with a flourishing economy and our leadership for peace and security respected around the world. Just think how much more progress we could have made over the past 40 years if we\\'d had a Democratic President. Think about the lost opportunities of these past seven years on the environment and the economy, on health care and civil rights, on education, foreign policy and the Supreme Court. Imagine how far we could have come, how much we could have achieved if we had just had a Democrat in the White House. We cannot let this moment slip away. We have come too far and accomplished too much. Now, the journey ahead will not be easy. Some will say we can\\'t do it, that it\\'s too hard, we\\'re just not up to the task. But for as long as America has existed, it has been the American way to reject can\\'t-do claims and to choose instead to stretch the boundaries of the possible through hard work, determination, and a pioneering spirit. It is this belief, this optimism that Senator Obama and I share and that has inspired so many millions of our supporters to make their voices heard. So today I am standing with Senator Obama to say: Yes, we can! And that together we will work -- we\\'ll have to work hard to achieve universal health care. But on the day we live in an America where no child, no man, and no woman is without health insurance, we will live in a stronger America. That\\'s why we need to help elect Barack Obama our President. We\\'ll have to work hard to get back to fiscal responsibility and a strong middle class. But on the day we live in an America whose middle class is thriving and growing again, where all Americans, no matter where they live or where their ancestors came from, can earn a decent living, we will live in a stronger America. And that is why we must help elect Barack Obama our President. We\\'ll have to work hard to foster the innovation that will make us energy independent and lift the threat of global warming from our children\\'s future. But on the day we live in an America fueled by renewable energy, we will live in a stronger America. And that is why we have to help elect Barack Obama our President. We\\'ll have to work hard to bring our troops home from Iraq and get them the support they\\'ve earned by their service. But on the day we live in an America that\\'s as loyal to our troops as they have been to us, we will live in a stronger America. And that is why we must help elect Barack Obama our President. This election is a turning-point election. And it is critical that we all understand what our choice really is. Will we go forward together, or will we stall and slip backwards? Now, think how much progress we\\'ve already made. When we first started, people everywhere asked the same questions. Could a woman really serve as commander-in-chief? Well, I think we answered that one. Could an African-American really be our President? And Senator Obama has answered that one. Together, Senator Obama and I achieved milestones essential to our progress as a nation, part of our perpetual duty to form a more perfect union. Now, on a personal note, when I was asked what it means to be a woman running for President, I always gave the same answer, that I was proud to be running as a woman, but I was running because I thought I\\'d be the best President. But -- But I am a woman and, like millions of women, I know there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious, and I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us. I ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of. I ran as a mother who worries about my daughter\\'s future and a mother who wants to leave all children brighter tomorrows. To build that future I see, we must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and their mothers, and that women enjoy equal opportunities, equal pay, and equal respect. Let us -- Let us resolve and work toward achieving very simple propositions: There are no acceptable limits, and there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century in our country. You can be so proud that, from now on, it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories; unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee; unremarkable to think that a woman can be the President of the United States -- and that is truly remarkable, my friends. To those who are disappointed that we couldn\\'t go all of the way, especially the young people who put so much into this campaign, it would break my heart if, in falling short of my goal, I in any way discouraged any of you from pursuing yours. Always aim high, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in. And, when you stumble, keep faith. And, when you\\'re knocked down, get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you can\\'t or shouldn\\'t go on. As we gather here today in this historic, magnificent building, the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead. If we can blast 50 women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House. Although we weren\\'t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\\'s got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time. That has always been the history of progress in America. Think of thesuffragists who gathered at Seneca Falls in 1848and those who kept fighting until women could cast their votes. Think of the abolitionists who struggled and died to see the end of slavery. Think of the civil rights heroes and foot soldiers who marched, protested, and risked their lives to bring about the end of segregation andJim Crow. Because of them, I grew up taking for granted that women could vote and, because of them, my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could go to school together. Because of them, Barack Obama and I could wage a hard-fought campaign for the Democratic nomination. Because of them and because of you, children today will grow up taking for granted that an African-American or a woman can, yes, become the President of the United States. And so when that day arrives, and a woman takes the oath of office as our President, we will all stand taller, proud of the values of our nation, proud that every little girl can dream big and that her dreams can come true in America. And all of you will know that, because of your passion and hard work, you helped pave the way for that day. So I want to say to my supporters: When you hear people saying or think to yourself, \"If only, or, \"What if,\" I say, please, don\\'t go there. Every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward. Life is too short, time is too precious, and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been. We have to work together for what still can be. And that is why I will work my heart out to make sure that Senator Obama is our next President. And I hope and pray that all of you will join me in that effort. To my supporters and colleagues in Congress, to the governors and mayors, elected officials who stood with me in good times and bad, thank you for your strength and leadership. To my friends in our labor unions who stood strong every step of the way, I thank you and pledge my support to you. To my friends from every stage of my life, your love and ongoing commitment sustained me every single day. To my family, especially Bill and Chelsea and my mother, you mean the world to me, and I thank you for all you have done. And to my extraordinary staff, volunteers and supporters, thank you for working those long, hard hours. Thank you for dropping everything, leaving work or school, traveling to places that you\\'ve never been, sometimes for months on end. And thanks to your families, as well, because your sacrifice was theirs, too. All of you were there for me every step of the way. Now, being human, we are imperfect. That\\'s why we need each other, to catch each other when we falter, to encourage each other when we lose heart. Some may lead, some may follow, but none of us can go it alone. The changes we\\'re working for are changes that we can only accomplish together. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are rights that belong to us as individuals. But our lives, our freedom, our happiness are best enjoyed, best protected, and best advanced when we do work together. That is what we will do now, as we join forces with Senator Obama and his campaign. We will make history together, as we write the next chapter in America\\'s story. We will stand united for the values we hold dear, for the vision of progress we share, and for the country we love. There is nothing more American than that. And looking out at you today, I have never felt so blessed. The challenges that I have faced in this campaign are nothing compared to those that millions of Americans face every day in their own lives. So today I\\'m going to count my blessings and keep on going. I\\'m going to keep doing what I was doing long before the cameras ever showed up and what I\\'ll be doing long after they\\'re gone: working to give every American the same opportunities I had and working to ensure that every child has the chance to grow up and achieve his or her God- given potential.I will do it with a heart filled with gratitude, with a deep and dividing love for our country, and with nothing but optimism and confidence for the days ahead. This is now our time to do all that we can to make sure that, in this election, we add another Democratic President to that very small list of the last 40 years and that we take back our country and once again move with progress and commitment to the future. Thank you all. And God bless you, and God bless America.',\n",
       " 'We\\x92ve just come from a meeting of clergy, and elected officials, and community leaders here in Staten Island. And there\\x92s a lot of pain and frustration in the room this evening.And, at the same time, a lot of purposefulness. Everyone here, having spent so much of their lives trying to address some of the divisions that afflict us \\x96 in particular, our brothers and sisters who are members of the clergy, having devoted themselves to comforting and supporting people in all sorts of situations. Yet, tonight, there was a particular sense of challenge, and of pain.I want to thank everyone who gathered together, in common purpose. I want to thank Bishop Brown for hosting us, for his leadership. I want to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and Public Advocate Tish James. I want to thank Borough President Jimmy Oddo. I want to offer a special thank you to Council Member Debi Rose, who has been in the center of so much of what\\x92s happened in these last months, to help people understand what we have to do together to move forward, but also to listen, and absorb the pain and the frustration so many people have faced. I know it has not been easy, council member, but I want to thank you for your profound leadership.And to so many of the clergy that you worked with, who have been such important partners in reminding people we have to find a way forward. And we have to find a way forward together, by definition.It\\x92s a very emotional day for our city. It\\x92s a very painful day for so many New Yorkers. That is the core reality. So many people in this city are feeling pain right now. And we\\x92re grieving, again, over the loss of Eric Garner, who was a father, a husband, a son, a good man \\x96 a man who should be with us, and isn\\x92t. That pain, that simple fact, is felt again so sharply today.I spent some time with Ben Garner, Eric\\x92s father, who is in unspeakable pain. And it\\x92s a very hard thing to spend time trying to comfort someone you know is beyond the reach of comfort because of what he\\x92s been through. I can only imagine. I couldn\\x92t help but immediately think what it would mean to me to lose Dante. Life could never be the same thereafter, and I could feel how it will never be whole again \\x96 things will never be whole again for Mr. Garner. And even in the midst of his pain, one of the things he stopped and said so squarely was, there can\\x92t be violence. He said Eric would not have wanted violence, violence won\\x92t get us anywhere. He was so sharp and clear in his desire, despite his pain. I found it noble. I could only imagine what it took for him to summon that. No family should have to go through what the Garner family went through.And the tragedy is personal to this family, but it\\x92s become something personal to so many of us. It\\x92s put in stark perspective the relationship between police and community. This issue has come to the fore again, and we have to address them with all our might. We can\\x92t stop. We have to act, with the assumption that it\\x92s all of our jobs to never have a tragedy again \\x96 that\\x92s what we have to fight for.This is profoundly personal for me. I was at the White House the other day, and the President of the United States turned to me, and he met Dante a few months ago, and he said that Dante reminded him of what he looked like as a teenager. And he said, I know you see this crisis through a very personal lens. I said to him I did. Because Chirlane and I have had to talk to Dante for years, about the dangers he may face. A good young man, a law-abiding young man, who would never think to do anything wrong, and yet, because of a history that still hangs over us, the dangers he may face \\x96 we\\x92ve had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him.And that painful sense of contradiction that our young people see first \\x96 that our police are here to protect us, and we honor that, and at the same time, there\\x92s a history we have to overcome, because for so many of our young people, there\\x92s a fear. And for so many of our families, there\\x92s a fear. So I\\x92ve had to worry, over the years, Chirlane\\x92s had to worry \\x96 was Dante safe each night? There are so many families in this city who feel that each and every night \\x96 is my child safe? And not just from some of the painful realities \\x96 crime and violence in some of our neighborhoods \\x96 but are they safe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors? That\\x92s the reality. And it conforms to something bigger that you\\x92ve heard come out in the protests in Ferguson, and all over the country.This is now a national moment of grief, a national moment of pain, and searching for a solution, and you\\x92ve heard in so many places, people of all backgrounds, utter the same basic phrase. They\\x92ve said \\x93Black Lives Matter.\\x94 And they said it because it had to be said. It\\x92s a phrase that should never have to be said \\x96 it should be self-evident. But our history, sadly, requires us to say that Black Lives Matter. Because, as I said the other day, we\\x92re not just dealing with a problem in 2014, we\\x92re not dealing with years of racism leading up to it, or decades of racism \\x96 we are dealing with centuries of racism that have brought us to this day. That is how profound the crisis is.\\xa0 And that is how fundamental the task at hand is, to turn from that history and to make a change that is profound and lasting.In the here and now, so many New Yorkers will ask the question, what will happen next? They\\x92ll ask, will there be a full airing of these facts? Will there be some investigation that means something to them? And I think the truth is important here. One chapter has closed, with the decision of this grand jury. There are more chapters ahead. The police department will initiate now its own investigation, and make its own decisions about the administrative actions it can take. The federal government is clearly engaged and poised to act. Just before the meeting began with the leaders here on Staten Island, I received a phone call from the United States Attorney General Eric Holder, and from U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. They made clear that the investigation initiated by the U.S. Attorney would now move forward, that it would be done expeditiously, that it would be done with a clear sense of independence, and that it would be a thorough investigation. It was a palpable sense of resolve \\x96 the federal government will exercise its responsibilities here, and do a full and thorough investigation, and draw conclusions accordingly.We\\x92ve experienced one challenge after another in these last weeks. The events of Ferguson may have most sharply framed this discussion nationally. For all of us here, what\\'s happened in our own community is what we feel most deeply. It was hard for any one of us, as a human being, and particularly any of us who is a parent, to not be deeply pained by the death of Tamir Rice in Cleveland \\x96 a 12-year-old boy \\x96 something that\\'s very, very hard to fathom. And all of these pains add up and demand of us action. It is powerful, even in the midst of the pain, that our President is acting. It is powerful that our President is focusing on changing our approach to policing, to focus on community policing, focus on the value of body cameras as a new tool for accountability and transparency. It\\'s powerful that our Attorney General is focused. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); These things will matter. These things will lead to change. Here in this city, change is happening. Even in this moment, people are feeling pain and frustration and confusion. Change is happening right now and I said in the meeting change is happening because the people willed it to happen. We\\'re leaders, we all strive to serve and help our people, but the people willed this change to happen. The people believed the broken policy of stop and frisk had to end and it has ended. The people believed there were too many young people of color arrested and saddled with a record for the rest of their lives simply for the possession of a small amount of marijuana and that policy has been changed. The people demanded something different. It\\'s my responsibility and responsibility to everyone standing here with me to achieve that on behalf of the people.When I named Commissioner Bratton as our Police Commissioner, I knew him to be \\x96 I knew it at the time and I\\'ve seen it even more since \\x96 I knew him to be one of the greatest reformers and change agents in policing in the history of this country. I have seen that ability and those values play out each and every day.I saw it today at the New York City Police Department Academy where not only did we talk about what body cameras will mean in terms of changing the relationship between the police and community, we talked about the re-training of the entire police force, something that has never been done in this city before. We talked about helping our officers understand the different ways to diffuse confrontations. We talked about bringing our officers closer to the community from the point of their training, from the first moments of their experience as law enforcement officers, emphasizing the partnership they needed with the community.And I remind you, my faith in Commissioner Bratton is based on the actions he has taken over decades and it is also based on the clarity of his message to all of us. He gathered his top commanders a few weeks ago. It was well-reported. He said very publicly, the department will act aggressively to ensure any officer who is not meant to be in this work no longer is. He talked about those who don\\'t live up to the values of the uniform, who have \"brutal\", who are \\x93corrupt\\x94, who are \\x93racist\\x94, who are \\x93incompetent\\x94. This was our police commissioner making clear his standard that people who sadly fit those descriptions would not be members of the NYPD.These changes will matter. They will affect millions of people. They will take time, but that is not in any way an excuse or an unwillingness on our part to do anything but the fastest change we can. It\\'s an honest leveling with our people that not every change can happen overnight, but they\\'re happening resolutely and forcefully, more happening every day. Each change builds upon the next. There is a momentum for change that will be felt in every neighborhood in this city.And, again, it doesn\\'t come first and foremost, from City Hall, or from One Police Plaza, it comes from the people of this city who have demanded it. This change is about the values of our people, the will of our people, the goodness of our people. That\\'s where change comes from. And everyone has an opportunity to play a role in that change by continuing to work for it. And that is across every community.I have to emphasize, and we\\'ve seen this all over the country, but I know it\\'s true here, and I have an experience from last year that I think is evidence. This is not just a demand coming from the African American community. It\\'s not just a demand coming from the Latino community. It\\'s coming from every community. It\\'s coming from people from all faiths who want a city of fairness, who want violence to end, who want no family to go through the tragedy the Garners did.So, people will express themselves now, as they should in a democracy. I ask everyone to listen to what Ben Garner said and what Eric Garner\\'s son said as well \\x96 if you really want a dignified life of Eric Garner, you will do so through peaceful protest. You will work relentlessly for change. You will not sully his name with violence or vandalism. That doesn\\'t bring us closer to a better community. The only thing that has ever worked is peaceful protest. Non-violent social activism is the only thing that has ever worked.And the Garner family has made the abundantly clear. Michael Brown\\'s family made that abundantly clear. People should listen to those we say we stand in solidarity with, fulfill their wishes and work for change the right way.I\\'ll just finish with a couple more points and then I want to say something in Spanish before I depart.So many of us steeped in the teachings of Dr. King, there are many great leaders, but perhaps no one more definitional in the work of social change and the work of justice than Dr. King and he said something so fundamental that should remind us how we need to handle this moment. He said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" This is a problem for all New Yorkers. This is a problem for all Americans. It has to be treated as such.Anyone who says to you this is a problem only felt by people of color or only pertinent to young people and this is what\\'s going on here. It\\'s all our problem \\x96 and anyone who believes in the values of this country should feel called to action right now. Anyone who cares about justice, that American value of justice, should understand it is a moment that change must happen. Change is as good as the people that we represent.Just want to say in Spanish.[Mayor de Blasio speaks in Spanish]We have a lot of work to do together. I want to thank all of my colleagues who have been working so hard here in the neighborhoods of Staten Island and so many all over the city. Their work matters. Their work is being felt. It will continue to be felt as we continue the work of change and reform. I want to thank again Bishop Brown for bringing us together. I want to thank all of the leaders here today. I\\'ll turn to Bishop Brown and Speaker Mark-Viverito and Public Advocate James and they\\'ll continue talking to you.I want to thank you, everyone, for this chance to talk about this moment that we\\'re all facing together. And we will address our problems in this city together. Thank you.',\n",
       " '  Thank you, Joe, my old, dear friend, for those mostly undeserved kind \\r\\n\\t\\twords. Vice President Biden and I have known each other for a lot of \\r\\n\\t\\tyears now, more than 40, if you\\'re counting. We knew each other back \\r\\n\\t\\twhen we were young and handsome and smarter than everyone else but were \\r\\n\\t\\ttoo modest to say so. Joe was already a senator, and I was the Navy\\'s liaison officer to the Senate. \\r\\n\\t\\tMy duties included --as he mentioned earlier-- escorting senate delegations on overseas trips, and \\r\\n\\t\\tin that capacity, I supervised the delegation\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tluggage, which could require -- now and again when no one of lower \\r\\n\\t\\trank was available for the job -- that I carry someone else\\'s bag. \\r\\n\\t\\tOnce or twice that turned out to be the young senator from \\r\\n\\t\\tDelaware. I\\'ve resented it ever since. Joe has heard me joke about that before. I hope he has heard, too, my \\r\\n\\t\\tprofession of gratitude for his friendship and love these many years. It\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tmeant a lot to me. We -- We served in the Senate together for over 20 \\r\\n\\t\\tyears, during some eventful times, as we passed from young men to the \\r\\n\\t\\tfossils who appear before you this evening. We didn\\'t always agree on the issues. We often argued -- sometimes \\r\\n\\t\\tpassionately. But we believed in each other\\'s patriotism and the \\r\\n\\t\\tsincerity of each other\\'s convictions. We believed in the institution we \\r\\n\\t\\twere privileged to serve in. We believed in our mutual responsibility to \\r\\n\\t\\thelp make the place work and to cooperate in finding solutions to our \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry\\'s problems. We believed in our country and in our country\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tindispensability to international peace and stability and to the \\r\\n\\t\\tprogress of humanity. And through it all, whether we argued or agreed, \\r\\n\\t\\tJoe was good company. You all know -- he is good company. So thank you, old friend, for your company and your \\r\\n\\t\\tservice to America. Thank you, too, to theNational Constitution Center, and everyone \\r\\n\\t\\tassociated with it for this award. Thank you for that video, and for the \\r\\n\\t\\tall too generous compliments paid to me this evening. I\\'m aware of the \\r\\n\\t\\tprestigious company theLiberty Medalplaces me in. I\\'m humbled by it, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I\\'ll try my best not to prove too unworthy of it. Some years ago, I was present at an event where an earlier Liberty Medal \\r\\n\\t\\trecipient spoke about America\\'s values and the sacrifices made for \\r\\n\\t\\tthem.\\xa0 It was 1991, and I was attending the ceremony commemorating the \\r\\n\\t\\t50th anniversary of theattack on Pearl Harbor. The World War II \\r\\n\\t\\tveteran, estimable patriot and good man, President George Herbert Walker Bush, \\r\\n\\t\\tgavea moving speechat theUSS Arizona memorial. I remember it very \\r\\n\\t\\twell. His voice was thick with emotion as he neared the end of his \\r\\n\\t\\taddress. I imagine he was thinking not only of the brave Americans who \\r\\n\\t\\tlost their lives on December 7th, 1941, but of the friends he had served \\r\\n\\t\\twith and lost in the Pacific where he -- where he had been the Navy\\'s youngest \\r\\n\\t\\taviator.  \"Look at the water here, clear and quiet\" he directed, One day, [in] \\r\\n\\t\\twhat now seems another lifetime...it wrapped its arms around the finest \\r\\n\\t\\tsons any nation could ever have, and it...carried them to a better world. He could barely get out the last line, \"May God bless them. And may God \\r\\n\\t\\tbless America, the most wondrous [land] on Earth.\" The most wondrous land on earth, indeed. I\\'ve had the good fortune to \\r\\n\\t\\tspend 60 years in service to this wondrous land. It\\'s not been \\r\\n\\t\\tperfect service, to be sure, and there were probably times when the \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry might have benefited from a little less of my help. But I\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\ttried to deserve the privilege as best I can, and I\\'ve been repaid a \\r\\n\\t\\tthousand times over with adventures, with good company, and with the \\r\\n\\t\\tsatisfaction of serving something more important than myself, of being a \\r\\n\\t\\tbit player in the extraordinary story of America. And I am so  \\r\\n\\t\\tgrateful. What a privilege it is to serve this big, boisterous, brawling, \\r\\n\\t\\tintemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent \\r\\n\\t\\tcountry. With all our flaws, all our mistakes, with all the frailties of \\r\\n\\t\\thuman nature as much on display as our virtues, with all the rancor and \\r\\n\\t\\tanger of our politics, we are blessed. We are living in the land of the free, the land where anything is \\r\\n\\t\\tpossible, the land of the immigrant\\'s dream, the land with the storied \\r\\n\\t\\tpast forgotten in the rush to the imagined future, the land that repairs \\r\\n\\t\\tand reinvents itself, the land where a person can escape the \\r\\n\\t\\tconsequences of a self-centered youth and know the satisfaction of \\r\\n\\t\\tsacrificing for an ideal, the land where you can go from aimless \\r\\n\\t\\trebellion to a noble cause, and from the bottom of your class to your \\r\\n\\t\\tparty\\'s nomination for President. We are blessed, and we\\'ve been a blessing to humanity in turn. The \\r\\n\\t\\tinternational order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and \\r\\n\\t\\tthat we defend to this day, has liberated more people from tyranny and \\r\\n\\t\\tpoverty than ever before in history. This wondrous land -- This wondrous \\r\\n\\t\\tland has shared its \\r\\n\\t\\ttreasures and ideals and shed the blood of its finest patriots to help \\r\\n\\t\\tanother -- to help make another, better world. And as we did so, we made our own \\r\\n\\t\\tcivilization more just, freer, more accomplished and prosperous than the \\r\\n\\t\\tAmerica that existed when I watched my father go off to war on December \\r\\n\\t\\t7th, 1941. To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a \\r\\n\\t\\tcentury, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to \\r\\n\\t\\trefuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to \\r\\n\\t\\tremain \"the last best hope of earth\"1for the sake of some half-baked, \\r\\n\\t\\tspurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find \\r\\n\\t\\tscapegoats than solve problems is as -- is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any \\r\\n\\t\\tother tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash -- theash heap \\r\\n\\t\\tof history. We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.\\xa0We are the \\r\\n\\t\\tcustodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tdone great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we \\r\\n\\t\\thave become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral \\r\\n\\t\\tobligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than \\r\\n\\t\\tshame on ourselves if we don\\'t. We will not thrive in a world where our \\r\\n\\t\\tleadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn\\'t deserve to. I\\'m the luckiest guy on earth. I have served America\\'s cause -- the \\r\\n\\t\\tcause of our security and the security of our friends, the cause of \\r\\n\\t\\tfreedom and equal justice -- all my adult life. I haven\\'t always served \\r\\n\\t\\tit well. I haven\\'t even always appreciated what I was serving. But among \\r\\n\\t\\tthe few compensations of old age is the acuity of hindsight. I see now \\r\\n\\t\\tthat I was part of something important that drew me along in its wake \\r\\n\\t\\teven when I was diverted by other interests. I was, knowingly or not, \\r\\n\\t\\talong for the ride as America made the future better than the past. And I\\'ve enjoyed it, every single day of it, the good ones and the not \\r\\n\\t\\tso good ones. I\\'ve been inspired by the service of better patriots than \\r\\n\\t\\tme. I\\'ve seen Americans make sacrifices for our country and her causes \\r\\n\\t\\tand for people who were strangers to them but for our common humanity, \\r\\n\\t\\tsacrifices that were much harder than the service ever asked of me. And I\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tseen the good they\\'ve done, the lives they\\'ve freed from tyranny and \\r\\n\\t\\tinjustice, the hope they encouraged, the dreams they\\'ve made achievable. May God bless them. May God bless America, and give us the strength and \\r\\n\\t\\twisdom, the generosity and compassion, to do our duty for this wondrous \\r\\n\\t\\tland, and for the world that counts on us. With all its suffering and \\r\\n\\t\\tdanger, the world still looks to the example and leadership of America \\r\\n\\t\\tto become another, better place. What greater cause could anyone ever \\r\\n\\t\\tserve. Thank you again for this honor. I\\'ll treasure it.',\n",
       " 'Ricchetti, you\\'re fired. For the \\r\\n\\t\\tpress, Ricchetti is my chief of staff.I had no inkling. \\xa0I thought we were coming over, Michelle, to -- for \\r\\n\\t\\tyou, Jill, and Barack and I and a couple of senior staff to toast one \\r\\n\\t\\tanother and say what an incredible journey it\\'s been.Mr. President, you got right the part about my leaning on Jill. \\xa0But \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room. \\xa0I look around \\r\\n\\t\\tthe room, and I see great friends likeTed Kaufman, who has been -- has \\r\\n\\t\\tso much wisdom. \\xa0Guys like Mel Monzack. \\xa0I look around here and I\\'m \\r\\n\\t\\tstartled. \\xa0I keep seeing people I don\\'t expect. \\xa0Madam President \\r\\n\\t\\t[Hillary Clinton], how \\r\\n\\t\\tare you? \\xa0Mr. President, look at my new boss over there.But you know, I get a lot of credit I don\\'t deserve, to state the \\r\\n\\t\\tobvious and -- because I\\'ve always had somebody to lean on. \\xa0From back \\r\\n\\t\\tthat time in 1972, when the accident happened, I leaned on -- and I mean \\r\\n\\t\\tthis in literal sense; Chris knows this -- Dodd knows this, and Mel \\r\\n\\t\\tknows this, and Ted knows this -- I leaned on my sons Beau and Hunter. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0And I continue to lean on Hunter who continues to in a bizarre kind of \\r\\n\\t\\tway raise me. \\xa0I mean I\\'ve leaned on them. And, Mr. President, you observed early on \\r\\n\\t\\tthat when either one of my boys would walk in the room, they\\'d walk up \\r\\n\\t\\tand say, Dad, what can I get you? \\xa0Dad, what do you need?And then Jill came along, and she saved our lives. \\xa0She -- no man \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserves one great love, let alone two. \\xa0And -- but everybody knows \\r\\n\\t\\there, I am Jill\\'s husband. \\xa0Everybody knows that I love her more than \\r\\n\\t\\tshe loves me. With good reason. And she gave me the most \\r\\n\\t\\tprecious gift, the love of my life, the life of my love, my daughter, \\r\\n\\t\\tAshley.And I continue to lean on the family. \\xa0Mr. President, you kidded me \\r\\n\\t\\tonce. \\xa0You heard that the preparation for the two debates -- vice \\r\\n\\t\\tpresidential debates that I had -- I only had two that Beau and Hunt \\r\\n\\t\\twould be the last people in the room. \\xa0And Beau would say, look at me, \\r\\n\\t\\tDad. \\xa0Look at me. \\xa0Remember, remember home base. \\xa0Remember.And the Secret Service can tell you, Mr. President, that Beau and Hunt \\r\\n\\t\\tand Ashley continue to have to corral me. \\xa0We were at one of the \\r\\n\\t\\tnational parks, and I was climbing up on top of a bridge to jump off the \\r\\n\\t\\tbridge with a bunch of young kids. \\xa0And I hear my sons yelling, Dad, get \\r\\n\\t\\tdown. \\xa0Now! And I just started laughing so hard I couldn\\'t stop. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0And I said, I was just going to do a flip -- a full gainer off here.He said, Dad, the Secret Service doesn\\'t want you up there. \\xa0Dad. \\xa0Look \\r\\n\\t\\tat me, Dad.So we\\'ve never figured out who the father is in this family.And, Mr. President, you know that with good reason there is no power in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe vice presidency. \\xa0Matter of fact I just did for Nancy Pelosi\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughter a reading of the Constitution. \\xa0You probably did one for her. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0And they had me read the provisions relating to the vice presidency in \\r\\n\\t\\tthe Constitution. \\xa0And there is no inherent power, nor should there be.But, Mr. President, you have more than kept your commitment to me by \\r\\n\\t\\tsaying that you wanted me to help govern. \\xa0The President\\'s line often -- \\r\\n\\t\\tother people don\\'t hear it that often, but when someone would say, can \\r\\n\\t\\tyou get Joe to do such and such. \\xa0He says, I don\\'t do his schedule. \\xa0He \\r\\n\\t\\tdoesn\\'t do mine.Every single thing you\\'ve asked me to do, Mr. President, you have \\r\\n\\t\\ttrusted me to do. \\xa0And that is -- that\\'s a remarkable thing. \\xa0I don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tthink according to -- I see the President of Georgetown here, as well. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0I don\\'t think according to the presidential, vice presidential scholars \\r\\n\\t\\tthat kind of relationship has existed. I mean, for real. \\xa0It\\'s all you, \\r\\n\\t\\tMr. President. \\xa0It\\'s all you.The reason why when you send me around the world, nothing gets -- as my \\r\\n\\t\\tmom would say, gets missed between the cup and the lip, it\\'s because \\r\\n\\t\\tthey know when I speak, I speak for you.And it\\'s been easy, Mr. President, because we not only have the same \\r\\n\\t\\tpolitical philosophy and ideology, I tell everybody -- and I\\'ve told \\r\\n\\t\\tthem from the beginning. \\xa0And I\\'m not saying this to reciprocate. \\xa0I\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tnever known a President and few people I\\'ve ever met my whole life -- I \\r\\n\\t\\tcan count on less than one hand -- who have had the integrity and the \\r\\n\\t\\tdecency and the sense of other people\\'s needs like you do.I know you were upset when I told the story about when Hunt and I were \\r\\n\\t\\tworried thatBeauwould have to -- that he would, as a matter of honor, \\r\\n\\t\\tdecide he had to step down as attorney general while he was fighting his \\r\\n\\t\\tbattle because he had aphasia. \\xa0He was losing his ability to speak, and \\r\\n\\t\\the didn\\'t want to ever be in a position where to him everything was \\r\\n\\t\\tabout duty and honor.And I said, and he may resign. \\xa0I don\\'t know I just have the feeling he \\r\\n\\t\\tmay. \\xa0And Hunt and I had talked about this. \\xa0And I said, he doesn\\'t have \\r\\n\\t\\tany other income, but we\\'re all right because Hunt\\'s there, and I can \\r\\n\\t\\tsell the house.We were having a private lunch like we do once a week. \\xa0And this man got \\r\\n\\t\\tup, came over, grabbed me by the shoulders, looked me in the eye, and \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid, don\\'t you sell that house. \\xa0You love that house.I said, it\\'s no big deal, Mr. President. \\xa0He said, I\\'ll give you the \\r\\n\\t\\tmoney. \\xa0We\\'ll give you the money. \\xa0Promise me, promise me you won\\'t sell \\r\\n\\t\\tthat house.I remember when Ashley, Mr. President, we were in the Oval, and Ashley \\r\\n\\t\\twas in an elevator, and the elevator plummeted to the -- she was with a \\r\\n\\t\\tgroup of people -- I forget which building in Philadelphia, and it \\r\\n\\t\\tplummeted to the ground. \\xa0And immediately the Service was worried that \\r\\n\\t\\tshe may have been badly hurt. \\xa0And I got up to take the call, and you \\r\\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t let up until you made sure your service followed through and made \\r\\n\\t\\tsure everything was all right.But you know, Mr. President, we kid about both about marrying up. \\xa0We \\r\\n\\t\\tboth did, that kind of thing. \\xa0But the truth of the matter is -- I said \\r\\n\\t\\tthis toMichellelast night. \\xa0Michelle is the finest First Lady in my \\r\\n\\t\\tview that has ever served in the office. \\xa0There\\'s been other great \\r\\n\\t\\tFirst Ladies, but I really genuinely mean it.When I got to meet Michelle\\'s brother, and he told me about how you guys \\r\\n\\t\\twere raised, and I got to know and love your mom, if your mom -- were \\r\\n\\t\\tyour mom 15 years older, she could have been my mom. \\xa0Literally, the way \\r\\n\\t\\tyou were raised, the way we were raised, there wasn\\'t any difference. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0And I knew that this decision to join you, which was the greatest honor \\r\\n\\t\\tof my life, was the right decision on the night we had to go and accept \\r\\n\\t\\tthe nomination, the formal -- we\\'d be nominated at the convention. \\xa0And \\r\\n\\t\\tFinnegan, who is now 18 years old, was then 10 years old. \\xa0And she came \\r\\n\\t\\tto me, and she said, Pop, is it okay if the room that we\\'re in -- \\r\\n\\t\\tFinnegan, Maisy, and Naomi -- that we have the beds taken out. \\xa0And I \\r\\n\\t\\tsaid, why? \\xa0She said, maybe the Obama girls and your brothers\\' children, \\r\\n\\t\\tmaybe they would come down, all sleep together in sleeping bags. And I give you my word as a Biden, I knew when I left to go to the \\r\\n\\t\\tconvention, open that door, and saw them cuddled together, I knew this \\r\\n\\t\\twas the right decision. \\xa0I knew it was the right decision. \\xa0I really \\r\\n\\t\\tdid. \\xa0Because, Mr. President, the same values set -- the same values \\r\\n\\t\\tset.Folks, you know, I joke with my staff that I don\\'t know why they pay \\r\\n\\t\\tthem anything, because they get to advise me. Let me explain what \\r\\n\\t\\tI mean by that. \\xa0As the President of the University of Delaware, where \\r\\n\\t\\tmy heart resides, and my home campus of Delaware, as he can tell you, \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s -- I get to give you advice. \\xa0I get to be the last guy in the room \\r\\n\\t\\tand give you advice on the most difficult decisions anyone has to make \\r\\n\\t\\tin the whole world. \\xa0But I get to walk out, and you make it all by \\r\\n\\t\\tyourself. \\xa0All by yourself.Harry Truman was right about the buck stopping at the desk. \\xa0And I\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\tnever, never, never, never, never, never, never, never once doubted, on \\r\\n\\t\\tthese life and death decisions, I never once doubted that your judgment \\r\\n\\t\\twas flawed -- not once. \\xa0Not once.And we\\'ve disagreed, and we\\'ve argued, and we\\'ve raised our voices, one \\r\\n\\t\\tof which we made a deal we\\'d be completely open like brothers with one \\r\\n\\t\\tanother. \\xa0But, Mr. President, I watched you under intense fire. \\xa0I will \\r\\n\\t\\tventure to say that no President in history has had as many novel crises \\r\\n\\t\\tland on his desk in all of history. \\xa0The Civil War was worse, the World \\r\\n\\t\\tWar Two was worse, but, Mr. President, almost every one of the crises \\r\\n\\t\\tyou faced was a case of first instance -- a case of first instance. \\xa0And \\r\\n\\t\\tI watched that prodigious mind and that heart as big as your head -- \\r\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve watched you. \\xa0I\\'ve watched how you\\'ve acted.When you see a woman or man under intense pressure, you get a measure -- \\r\\n\\t\\tand you know that, Michelle, and your daughters know it, as well. \\xa0This \\r\\n\\t\\tis a remarkable man. \\xa0And I just hope that the asterisk in history that \\r\\n\\t\\tis attached to my name when they talk about this presidency is that I \\r\\n\\t\\tcan say I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable \\r\\n\\t\\tthings for this country.You know, I can\\'t let a comment go by without quoting an Irish poet. Jill and I talk about why you were able to develop the way you \\r\\n\\t\\tdeveloped and with the heart you have. \\xa0Michelle and I have talked about \\r\\n\\t\\tit. \\xa0I\\'ve confided in Michelle, I\\'ve gone to her for advice. \\xa0We\\'ve \\r\\n\\t\\ttalked about this man. \\xa0You give me insight. \\xa0And I think it\\'s because \\r\\n\\t\\t-- Mr. President, you gave me credit for having understanding other \\r\\n\\t\\tpeople\\'s misery and suffering. \\xa0Mr. President, there is not one single, \\r\\n\\t\\tsolitary ounce of entitlement in you, or Michelle, or your beautiful \\r\\n\\t\\tdaughters -- and you girls are incredible, you really are. \\xa0That\\'s not \\r\\n\\t\\thyperbole, you really are. \\xa0Not one ounce of entitlement.AndSeamus Heaneyinone of his poemssaid, when you can \\r\\n\\t\\tfind someone who says it better, use it. \\xa0He said, \"You carried your own \\r\\n\\t\\tburden and very soon, your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared.\"1You carried your own burdens, and very soon, the creeping symptoms of \\r\\n\\t\\tprivilege disappeared.Mr. President, you have sometimes been like a lone wolf, but you carried \\r\\n\\t\\tyourself in a way that\\'s pretty remarkable. \\xa0The history of the journey \\r\\n\\t\\t-- your journey -- is something people are going to write about a long \\r\\n\\t\\ttime, and I\\'m not being solicitous when I say this. \\xa0And you\\'re so \\r\\n\\t\\tfortunate, both of you, to have found each other because all that \\r\\n\\t\\tgrounding, all that you have, made this guy totally whole. \\xa0And it\\'s \\r\\n\\t\\tpretty amazing.Mr. President, this honor is not only well beyond what I deserve, but \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s a reflection on the extent and generosity of your spirit. \\xa0I don\\'t \\r\\n\\t\\tdeserve this, but I know it came from the President\\'s heart. \\xa0There is a \\r\\n\\t\\tTalmudic saying that says, what comes from the heart, enters the heart. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\xa0Mr. President, you have creeped into our heart -- you and your whole \\r\\n\\t\\tfamily, including Mom -- and you occupy it. \\xa0It\\'s an amazing thing that \\r\\n\\t\\thappened. \\xa0I knew how smart you were. \\xa0I knew how honorable you were. \\xa0I \\r\\n\\t\\tknew how decent you were from the couple years we worked in the Senate, \\r\\n\\t\\tand I knew what you were capable of. \\xa0But I never fully expected that \\r\\n\\t\\tyou\\'d occupy the Bidens\\' heart, from Hunter, to Ashley, my sister, all \\r\\n\\t\\tof us. \\xa0All of us.And Mr. President, I\\'m indebted to you. \\xa0I\\'m indebted to your \\r\\n\\t\\tfriendship, I\\'m indebted to your family, and as I\\'ll tell you -- I\\'ll \\r\\n\\t\\tend on a humorous note. \\xa0We\\'re having a lunch -- lunches, and mostly \\r\\n\\t\\tit\\'s what\\'s ever in either one of our minds. \\xa0We\\'ll talk about family an \\r\\n\\t\\tawful lot. \\xa0And about six months in, President looks at me, he said, you \\r\\n\\t\\tknow, Joe, you know what surprised me? \\xa0How we\\'ve become such good \\r\\n\\t\\tfriends. And I said, surprised you?But that is candid Obama, and it\\'s real, and, Mr. President, you know as \\r\\n\\t\\tlong as there\\'s a breath in me, I\\'ll be there for you, my whole family \\r\\n\\t\\twill be, and I know, I know it is reciprocal. \\xa0And I want to thank you \\r\\n\\t\\tall so very, very, very much. \\xa0All of you in here.']"
